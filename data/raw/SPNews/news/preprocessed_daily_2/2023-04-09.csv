1,31955112-a139-3e43-b668-b53269afe6d7,TXN,2023-04-09,The 3 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks to Buy in April,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-long-term-dividend-111501656.html,1680779701,STORY,"['TXN', 'DVN', 'QSR']","[As inflation takes hold, and interest rates rise, investors have many options to choose from. Growth stocks may be less-enticing in this environment, but bonds and other dividend stocks to buy certainly make a compelling case for investors in this market.For those looking past fixed-income and alternative investments like real estate, dividend stocks have a lot to offer investors. Dividend-paying stocks that provide dependable income streams in times of economic stability are highly valued, for good reason. That’s because when it hits the fan, you want to own companies that can continue to return value to shareholders.Of course, identifying companies that can do so is easier said than done. Long-term dividend stocks to buy can take many forms.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, I’m going to highlight three of my top picks. Let’s dive in.DVNDevon Energy$53.18QSRRestaurant Brands$66.20TXNTexas Instruments$176.40Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy firm engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and gas liquids. The company’s predominant operations focus on the United States mainlands, comprising five distinct areas: the Delaware, Eagle Ford, Powder River, Anadarko and Williston.Investors focus on Devon for two reasons. First, this is one of the best operators in terms of shale oil in the U.S., with impressive metrics to back up this view. Second, Devon has among the most attractive dividends of its peers.Devon pays out a variable dividend, which increases and decreases along with the price of oil. Thus, over the past year, surging oil prices led to a massive special dividend for investors. The company’s trailing dividend yield of 10% speaks to this.While many investors may consider such a yield to be unsustainable (and it probably is), oil is on the move higher again. This week’s news that OPEC+ isn’t playing nice with the U.S. has boosted DVN stock big time. I think this could be a bigger win for U.S. oil companies than anyone else (the consumer is about to feel the pinch at the pump again).Story continuesOil prices will eventually find their equilibrium, which is probably lower than where prices are right now. Renewable energy is coming, and this is a sector that’s been highly cyclical.That said, DVN stock is one of the top dividend stocks to buy right now, in my books.Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockReaders who follow my columns know how passionate I am about Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR). Much of this has to do with the fact that it’s one of the dividend stocks to buy for those seeking a modicum of defensiveness in this current market.Various macro uncertainties remain high right now. There’s surging inflation, a banking crisis underway (that may not be completely over) and geopolitical conflict and tension everywhere. In this environment, it can be hard to invest in certain industries, for fear that consumer confidence (and spending) may dry up.However, for companies like Restaurant Brands, parent company of Burger King, Tim Horton’s, Popeye’s and Firehouse Subs, any time is a good time to invest in this name.If times are good, folks have more money to spend, and will choose to dine out more frequently. If a recession hits, then that casual fine dining restaurant gets replaced by the Burger King down the street, and Restaurant Brands takes more market share.Thus, this company has a business model that’s more of a “heads I win, tails you lose,” from the perspective of the consumer. For investors, that should be music to the ears right now.Currently, QSR stock pays a dividend yield of 3.3%, which is overlooked. The company’s growth prospects outshine its robust dividend, which has also consistently grown over the years. Over the long-term, this is one of the top dividend stocks to buy now.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the dividend stocks to buy that I haven’t covered very often. There are reasons for this, but mainly, I don’t like the electronics manufacturing space overall.That said, Texas Instruments is a complex beast, with a range of businesses, from semiconductors to electronics manufacturing. The global operator focuses on two main segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. The Analog segment includes Power and Signal Chains, where the latter offers products that aid in managing electronic systems’ power.Texas Instruments’ equity value has increased by 10% since the start of this year. That’s impressive, considering the fact that this isn’t a tech stock many would group into the “high-growth” category (those have done much better than the industrial names this year). Texas Instruments is a company I’d put in the middle of a tech stock and an industrial stock. It’s hard to say how a company like Texas Instruments is supposed to perform in this market. In many respects, I’ve got a natural outlook on the stock from a growth standpoint.That said, it’s the company’s dividend that’s intriguing to me. Currently, Texas Instruments pays out a yield of 2.7%. That’s nothing to write home about. But in the tech sector (if you can call this a tech stock), that’s a meaningful yield. For those seeking growth, TXN stock provides an option that pays a little additional yield, increasing long-term investors’ total return. That’s something worth considering.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in QSR. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

2,d346aa9d-75d6-3440-b475-b7e05bbf8963,USB,2023-04-09,Possible bearish signals as U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) insiders disposed of US$2.0m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-u-bancorp-110036268.html,1681038036,STORY,['USB'],"[In the last year, many U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpThe Vice Chairman of Consumer &amp; Business Banking, Timothy Welsh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$35.75. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$109m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About U.S. Bancorp Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded U.S. Bancorp shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the U.S. Bancorp insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with U.S. Bancorp and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

In contrast the stock is up over the last three years. In that time, it is up 24%, which isn't bad, but not amazing either.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Huntington Bancshares achieved compound earnings per share growth of 4.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Huntington Bancshares' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Huntington Bancshares the TSR over the last 3 years was 43%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Huntington Bancshares shareholders are down 15% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 9.2%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Huntington Bancshares has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is potentially serious)  we think you should know about.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. For example, the Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) share price return of 39% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 6.1% in the last year.In light of the stock dropping 4.0% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years of share price growth, Ralph Lauren actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 3.3% per year.Given the share price resilience, we don't think the (declining) EPS numbers are a good measure of how the business is moving forward, right now. So other metrics may hold the key to understanding what is influencing investors.It could be that the revenue growth of 5.8% per year is viewed as evidence that Ralph Lauren is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthRalph Lauren is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Ralph Lauren's TSR for the last 3 years was 47%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Ralph Lauren shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.4% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 2% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Ralph Lauren is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

10,6027830c-4a1d-3ac5-958b-6018274c0935,MRO,2023-04-09,The 7 Best Oil and Gas Stocks to Buy in April 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-oil-gas-stocks-230814478.html,1680736094,STORY,"['CL=F', 'OXY', 'PBR-A', 'XOM', 'STR-WT', 'EGY', 'EPM', 'MRO']","[With crude oil prices zooming back above $80 per barrel, you may be wondering about the best oil and gas stocks to buy. A further rise in spot petroleum prices could spark a bigger rally in energy stocks, which have perked up after trending lower in early 2023.Some may argue that oil’s latest rally, driven by surprise news of production cuts from OPEC+, will not last. Yet, several analysts have argued that, with the prospect of more preemptive supply cuts from OPEC+ and the rebound in demand from China, oil prices have more room to run.If factors such as a further economic slowdown in the U.S. and Europe counter this, at the very least crude prices may be able to hold steady. Or energy stocks could continue to rally with the market re-rating the sector to a higher valuation as concerns about a drop back to pre-2022 oil prices diminish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you’re bullish on the sector, here are seven of the best oil and gas stocks to buy right now, which run the gamut from household names to under-the-radar plays.EGYVAALCO Energy$4.93EPMEvolution Petroleum$6.62MROMarathon Oil$25.69OXYOccidental Petroleum$64.57PBRPetroleo Brasileiro$10.87STRSitio Royalties$24.37XOMExxon Mobil$116.99VAALCO Energy (EGY)Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comBefore diving into some of the best large-cap oil and gas stocks to buy, let’s take a look at a smaller independent exploration and production (E&amp;P) company. In addition to the recent rise in oil prices, Houston-based VAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) is appealing for three reasons.First, EGY stock trades at a low valuation of 4.3 times earnings, and there may be a path to multiple expansion. As I’ve argued previously, VAALCO’s merger last year with Canada’s TransGlobe Energy made the company more geographically diversified. In time, this could result in investors re-rating the stock to a higher earnings multiple, somewhere in the mid to high single digits.Story continuesSecond, even if multiple expansion isn’t in the cards, shares could still move higher in tandem with earnings growth stemming from cost-reduction synergies. Third, total returns could be boosted by EGY’s recently raised dividend, which gives it a forward yield of 5.5%.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)Image of an oil wells with a dark blue skySource: ShutterstockEvolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is another small independent E&amp;P company. While this microcap energy stock doesn’t have a large following, plenty of investors seeking high yields have caught onto this opportunity.The stock has a dividend yield of 7.1%. With a payout ratio of 36%, this payout is likely sustainable if energy prices hold up. But EPM’s above-average yield isn’t the only thing to be excited about. There is also the potential for a high level of price appreciation, irrespective of whether crude oil zooms back above $100 per barrel or trades sideways from here.As stated in the company’s February investor presentation, management remains focused on maximizing shareholder value through its dividend and accretive acquisitions of high-quality, low-risk energy assets.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comAfter looking at two smaller E&amp;P names, let’s turn to a more familiar name that is among the best oil and gas stocks to buy. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) bounced back in a big way during the 2021 oil recovery. It experienced a further boost when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spiked oil prices in early 2022.Since then, however, MRO stock has traded sideways. Yet, even as it may seem that oil and gas prices will need to revisit last year’s highs for Marathon to produce strong returns, that may not necessarily be the case.MRO could still produce solid long-term returns through aggressive return-of-capital efforts. Last year, Marathon bought back 15% of its outstanding shares and raised its dividend three times. Management plans to continue returning at least 40% of its free cash flow to investors.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has been making headlines lately, and not only because of the crude oil rally. As you may know, shares of this E&amp;P giant have become a favorite of legendary investor Warren Buffett.Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has been an investor in OXY since 2019, when it purchased $10 billion in preferred stock. Since then, Berkshire has been buying up common shares of OXY stock. After its latest addition of shares last month, Berkshire owns a 23.5% stake in the company.However, there’s more to OXY than merely riding Buffett’s coattails. Besides being one of the highest-quality oil stocks out there, Occidental also has a major “green” catalyst. Per Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vicki Hollub, the company’s carbon capture business could be a major contributor to OXY’s bottom line a decade from now.Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comPetroleo Brasileiro (NYSE:PBR), better known as Petrobras, may not seem like one of the best oil and gas stocks to buy due to political uncertainties. The election of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (or Lula, for short) as Brazil’s president last year has weighed on shares of this state-controlled integrated oil company.Early last month, pressure on PBR stock intensified, as Lula (a leftist, especially on economic issues) criticized Petrobras for its focus on dividends rather than on capital investments beneficial to Brazil’s growth. Yet, while jurisdictional risks are real with PBR, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should stay away.Negative sentiment has pushed shares to a bargain-basement valuation of less than 2 times earnings. Management has also assured investors that the company will keep paying “robust” dividends. If you are aware of the risks, it may be worthwhile to take a small, speculative position.Sitio Royalties (STR)photo of large oil well infrastructure in a field at sunsetSource: ShutterstockSitio Royalties (NYSE:STR) is a high-yield stock that I’ve talked about glowingly in recent months. In a nutshell, this company is in the business of acquiring oil and gas mineral and royalty interests.With management more focused on creating shareholder value than on building an energy empire, STR stock may be poised to produce strong returns if oil holds steady and especially if oil prices rally from here. Similar to the situation with Evolution Petroleum, Sitio is adept at making accretive acquisitions of energy assets. This could drive continued growth in cash flow.Sitio will plow a portion of this cash flow back into new acquisitions, but a lot of it will come back to shareholders, primarily in the form of dividends. STR’s payouts are variable, but if oil prices continue to trend higher, chances are STR will continue to sport a double-digit dividend yield.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is perhaps the first oil stock that comes to mind not only for most investors but for the general public as well. Yet, there is more than just “buy what you know” at play when it comes to arguing for XOM being one of the best oil and gas stocks to buy.For one, as InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier has discussed, the venerable integrated oil giant is in the midst of an aggressive cost-reduction program.

The increased cash flow will also fuel Exxon Mobil’s buyback and dividend efforts.Not only that, as with Occidental, there’s a decarbonization catalyst in play too with XOM.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Cheap Social Media Stocks to Buy. In recent years, social media has emerged as a potent marketing tool for businesses of all sizes due to its diverse platforms and extensive reach. Nonetheless, social media trends can be fleeting, particularly as technology progresses and various platforms fluctuate in popularity. Staying up-to-date with trends is crucial in the world of social media. In the coming year, short-form videos, increased video budgets, content creation, and influencer marketing are expected to dominate. To safeguard content, data, and people on social media, Market Research Future's extensive research report predicts that the global social media security market will experience significant growth during the review period of 2022 to 2030, with a growth rate of approximately 16.40%. The market is expected to reach a size of around $3863.45 million by the end of 2030.According to Insider Intelligence’s forecast, ad revenue growth will bounce back to 8.2% this year, following a historic 2.0% drop in 2022. Nevertheless, this growth will not be sufficient to reverse the declining share of ad revenue. The firm’s projection shows that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s portion of global digital ad spending reached its highest point of 22.0% in 2021 but will decrease to 19.4% this year. Facebook's worldwide monthly users will only increase by 0.3% this year, and for the first time, its share of internet users will fall below 45%. Additionally, Instagram's ability to compensate for Facebook's losses is decreasing, as its monthly user base will grow by 4.7% this year, but its share of global internet users will only increase by less than one percentage point, to 28.7%.In 2023, the advertising revenue for TikTok and Douyin, which are social platforms owned by ByteDance, is expected to increase by 24.5%. As a result, ByteDance's share of worldwide digital advertising expenditure is predicted to reach 5.8%, which is more significant than the combined share of LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube. Moreover, by 2023, the total monthly user base for both apps is estimated to reach 1.70 billion users, which will make up 36.5% of all internet users globally and 45.2% of all social network users. Due to the chaotic atmosphere on Twitter, many users are abandoning the platform and opting for alternative ones that promote free conversations. This hunt for the next significant social app for Generation Z is fueling the quick expansion of platforms like BeReal and Gas, which serves as a caution for Snapchat and TikTok. If US lawmakers or regulators don't impede its growth, TikTok is set to join Facebook and Instagram as the third social network to exceed 100 million monthly users in the US by 2023.Story continuesSome of the best social media stocks to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:YY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20P/E Ratio as of April 4: 19.93JOYY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) manages social media platforms that provide users with an interactive and immersive experience through video and audio-based social platforms.

The revenue of $604.9 million came in-line with Wall Street consensus. For the first quarter of 2023, the company expects net revenues to be between $552 million and $570 million, versus a consensus of $593.50 million.Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang reiterated a Buy rating on JOYY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $49 from $62 on March 17. The company's Q4 results were reported as ""moderately above-expectation,"" but there is still a lack of visibility for FY23, leading the firm to adjust its estimates cautiously.

(NASDAQ:YY), compared to 17 funds in the prior quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is a significant position holder in the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $39.2 million. Here is what Tao Value had to say about JOYY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“We exited YY after 3.5 years near an all-time high. The annualized return (13~%) is below expectation, especially compared to founder CEO David Xueling Li’s net worth (mainly in YY shares) ballooning from $1.1B in 2018 to $2.3B in 2021. On value realization, I think YY did a good job, acquiring Bigo, spinning off then selling Huya &amp; selling YY Live to Baidu. But as a minority shareholder, we were treated unfairly. E.g. the Bigo deal (for buying shares from executives including Li) was done by YY stock when the price was severely depressed, causing significant dilution for our ownership. We learned our lessons and will evaluate more rigorously in management’s partnership mindset in the future.”7.

NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31P/E Ratio as of April 4: 20.70NetEase, Inc.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So on that note, Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Signet Jewelers:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$724m ÷ (US$6.6b - US$2.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).So, Signet Jewelers has an ROCE of 17%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 14% generated by the Specialty Retail industry. See our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers roceIn the above chart we have measured Signet Jewelers' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Signet Jewelers here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsSignet Jewelers is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 128% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesOn a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. The current liabilities has increased to 34% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.The Key TakeawayAs discussed above, Signet Jewelers appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And a remarkable 112% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Like most companies, Signet Jewelers does come with some risks, and we've found 3 warning signs  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

That’s because the company pays you to hold your shares when you have a dividend stock. And that’s true of even the biggest of large-cap stocks.Most dividend-paying large-cap stocks issue payouts on a quarterly or monthly basis. If you are a younger investor, putting those payouts back into the stock makes sense to increase your position and grow your portfolio even faster. Once you get that money, it’s yours to do with as you see fit.But if you’re a retiree, you’re probably more inclined to take those payouts as income to supplement your other retirement accounts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEither way works, and I appreciate a company that cares for its shareholders. I’ve used my Portfolio Grader to evaluate some of the most significant dividend-paying large-cap stocks that would make outstanding choices for any dividend portfolio.NVDANvidia $265.27MSFTMicrosoft $283.39AAPLApple $162.66CVXChevron $169.18KO Coca-Cola $62.71VLOValero Energy$133.31SBUXStarbucks $104.69Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo on a laptop screen trading stock marketSource: FP Creative / Shutterstock.comSemiconductor chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the hottest chip makers on the planet. The company’s stock is up nearly 90% in 2023, pushing the market capitalization to $689 billion.Nvidia produces chips that can produce amazingly advanced graphics highly prized by gaming applications and gaming centers. But with the popularity of the ChatGPT online chatbot developed by OpenAI, Nvidia is breaking new ground. It’s on Nvidia’s advanced graphics chips OpenAI is training its large language models. Nvidia is now making its DGX Cloud available online to give more businesses access to the infrastructure to develop artificial intelligence tools for themselves. The sky is the limit for NVDA at this point.Story continuesNvidia currently pays a minimal dividend. The payout ratio is 0.06%, but it’s still one of the more reliable dividend-paying large-cap stocks out there. I hope this company does a better job down the road of rewarding its shareholders with a payout.

AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) productsSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another of the dividend-paying large-cap stocks getting huge attention from ChatGPT and the growing AI trend. Microsoft partnered with OpenAI and uses the ChatGPT software to enhance searches on its Bing search engine and Edge web browser.The excitement helped push Microsoft shares up nearly 20% this year, with a market cap north of $2.1 trillion.As I wrote recently on my takeout on Microsoft, the company’s stock is also up on some positive news. It recently announced a plan to integrate AI technology into other platforms, including the planned Microsoft 365 Copilot. And these AI headwinds could also breathe new life into the Azure cloud computing segment.Microsoft, which provides a dividend yield of nearly 1%, has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comThey don’t get any bigger than Microsoft and the next company on our list. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of the iPhone, wearables and Mac computers, has a market cap of $2.6 trillion.It’s well on the way to becoming the first $3 trillion stock, particularly after gaining about 30% this year.Analysts are undoubtedly bullish about AAPL stock, citing robust demand for iPhones and strong interest in China. But I’m much more focused on the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. At that event, Apple could very well roll out its augmented reality/virtual reality headset product.It’s been a while since Apple’s shown us something entirely new, so the reception to such a product will impact AAPL stock. But if you need another reason to like Apple stock, consider the Services segment that includes the App Store and iCloud. Revenue from Services reached $19.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a new record for the company. That’s a significant trend considering that Apple gets a much higher profit margin on Services revenue than from items that require a lot of equipment and research, such as iPhones and headsets.Apple’s current dividend yield is 0.5%, and it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has upstream exploration and production facilities worldwide, including in the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico, Australia, Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstan, and sports a market cap of $324 billion.Chevron stock has been treading water the last few weeks, down about 5% on the year but showing a slight increase over the previous month. The stock appears to be gathering some steam to make another run higher, particularly now that OPEC announced it is cutting oil production.The rising oil price and demand for natural gas make Chevron a cash machine. The company brought in $35.5 billion in earnings in 2022 and doled out $11 billion in dividends while spending another $11.25 billion in share buybacks.With a dividend yield of 3.5%, CVX stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Coca-Cola (KO)a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cansSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.comFamed soda maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may be one of the best-known consumer brands on the planet. From its headquarters in Atlanta, Coca-Cola has become the world’s biggest non-alcoholic beverage company.That’s helped push Coca-Cola to a market capitalization of $270 billion, selling products in more than 200 countries around the world. But even with that massive footprint, the company believes it has a broad runway for growth. Coca-Cola claims it has a 14% market share in the developed world. But in the much larger developing and emerging world, Coca-Cola has roughly a 7% share.It has a vast arsenal of brands to market to those potential customers, including sodas and carbonated beverages, teas, coffees, water, sports drinks and juices. And it’s recently dipped its toes into alcoholic beverages by offering hard seltzers and canned mixed drinks.Earnings for the fourth quarter were $10.2 billion in revenue, beating analysts’ estimates for $9.93 billion revenue. KO also matched expectations, paying 45 cents in earnings per share.KO stock is up 5% over the last month, providing a dividend yield of nearly 3%. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Valero Energy (VLO)the gas pumps at a Valero gas stationSource: JustPixs / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is another excellent energy stock, but it’s of a different flavor than Chevron. Instead of oil and gas exploration, Valero is a downstream company that is the world’s largest producer of renewable fuels.Besides petroleum refineries, Valero has ethanol plants and offers dry distillers’ grains, ethanol and corn oil to gasoline blenders and refiners.Fourth-quarter earnings included $41.75 billion in revenue, but it missed expectations of $43.32 billion. Earnings per share of $8.45 per share was better than analysts’ expectations of $7.25.VLO stock is up 25% over the last 12 months, pushing its market capitalization to $47.2 billion. It also provides a healthy dividend yield of nearly 3%.VLO stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comFamed coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the world’s biggest restaurant chains, boasting more than 36,000 stores. But it’s also a company in transition.The company struggled mightily during the Covid-19 pandemic before finally rebounding by mid-2021 to set all-time highs. But since then, Starbucks stock has struggled.Faced with high inflation and unionization issues, interim CEO Howard Schultz stepped down last month to make way for new CEO Laxman Narasimhan. Previously, Narasimhan was CEO of Reckitt Benckiser Group (OTCMKTS:RGBLY) and had executive positions with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Notably, SBUX stock is up 5% since the change in power. Starbucks is a brand constantly tinkering with its menu to develop something new. The most recent offering is oleato coffee, a coffee drink infused with extra virgin olive oil. It will have to continue to evolve if it will be successful under Narasimhan’s watch.With a market cap of $119 billion, SBUX offers a dividend yield of 2%.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Schlumberger is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$43b - US$12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 13%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.0% generated by the Energy Services industry. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Schlumberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWe're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Schlumberger. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 159% over the trailing five years. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 45% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. Schlumberger may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Schlumberger's ROCEIn a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Schlumberger has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 15% in the last five years. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.One more thing, we've spotted   3 warning signs  facing Schlumberger that you might find interesting.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

It is one of the most watched indicators of overall stock market direction and includes 30 of the largest publicly traded firms. Thus, Dow stocks tend to get their fair share of attention from investors, due to their size and importance to the economy.The Dow represents the most significant industrial components of the U.S. economy. Thus, this index is often viewed as a way to measure the overall economic health of the U.S. So, one way to think of investing in Dow stocks, is that investors are making a bet that a particular industry is set to expand.With that in mind, let’s look at 3 Dow stocks to consider this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAXPAmerican Express$162.56MCDMcDonald’s$282.28AMGNAmgen$247.53American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is precisely the kind of stock investors should consider at any time, especially now. The economy is turbulent. Therefore, any firm that can thrive in such conditions deserves particular attention. And that’s exactly what American Express is doing.Indeed, 2022 was an excellent year for the credit card firm that serves a more affluent customer base. Revenues grew by 25%, reaching $52.86 billion. This came as processing volume rose 21%. Yes, net income and earnings per share declined overall in 2022. However, due to volatility, American Express had to increase its provisions for credit losses. That explains the modest declines in those areas.The company also increased its customer base by a record 12.5 million accounts in the year. Additionally, the company is expecting 15-17% revenue growth in 2023, anticipating that earnings will exceed 2021 levels. Company leadership is confident that American Express’s excellent customer base and non-banking business insulate it from broader economic headwinds.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comThere’s plenty of reason to believe McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock is a strong bet throughout 2023. Last year was a strong year for the fast-food giant. Sales increased 10% for the year on a year-over-year basis. And momentum continues to be strong, with fourth-quarter sales increasing by 12%.One way to understand why McDonald’s has thrived lately is to understand its strategy. That strategy is referred to as Accelerating the Arches, at the corporate level. It relies on core products centered around burgers, coffee, and chicken. If you’ve been to a McDonald’s in the last year, you’ve likely recognized the pared-down menu.One of the most important and highly-relevant aspects of McDonald’s strategy is its marketing focus on affordability. Prices of almost everything have increased, but McDonald’s remains one of the cheaper fast food options. It’s reasonable to assume that McDonald’s will continue to see strong demand as we head toward Q3 and Q4.That’s because economists increasingly suggest that a recession is more likely to hit, as credit risk piles up. In that scenario, affordability becomes even more paramount, making McDonald’s more appealing.Amgen (AMGN)Source: ShutterstockAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a leading pharmaceutical stock. As such, it relies on a vast portfolio of drugs to provide continued revenue growth over the long-term. Thus far, that cycle has continued indefinitely, so pharmaceutical companies with blockbuster drugs at peak sales tend to perform best.Amgen is in a transitional period in which its best-seller, Enbrel, is slipping. Meanwhile, its up-and-coming drugs must pick up the slack. Fortunately, that’s what is occurring – Prolia is on track to become a blockbuster drug, as Enbrel risks losing that status.Prolia is an osteoporosis drug that accounted for $992 million in sales in 2022. That brings it close to the $1 billion annual sales threshold used to determine blockbuster medicines. Meanwhile, Enbrel accounted for $1.098 billion in 2022 sales, down 1% year-over-year.Amgen’s vast revenues increased by 1% in 2022. That’s not great. But what is encouraging is that Prolia sales increased by 14% in 2022, and lessened the blow from declining sales from drugs such as Enbrel. Further, although Amgen’s sales only grew by 1% in 2022, its earnings per share rose by 18%. That means Amgen was able to reward investors, even as its business was flat.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Now that the dust has started to settle, one question looms large: Will that price rally stick, or fade away?Most Read from BloombergBond Market Is Overplaying the Risk of a Deep RecessionUS Navy Challenges Beijing in South China Sea Amid Taiwan DrillsSaudi Arabia’s Drive to Get Expats to Ditch Dubai Is Off to a Rocky StartApple’s 40% Plunge in PC Shipments Is Steepest Among Major Computer MakersTaking Crimea From Putin Has Become ‘Operation Unthinkable’Banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to RBC Capital Markets LLC raised their oil-price forecasts immediately after the OPEC+ cut. Yet, many traders still believe a souring economic outlook will block the group’s actions from pushing prices higher. Demand indicators are also starting to flash warning signs.It could end up being the ultimate test of what matters more to the market: tighter supplies, or the lackluster demand picture. That will likely bring more uncertainty over the direction of prices — a complicated development for the Federal Reserve and the world’s central bankers in their ongoing battle against inflation.“It’s a very hard market to trade right now,” said Livia Gallarati, a senior analyst at Energy Aspects. “If you’re a trader, you are pulled between what’s happening at a macroeconomic level and what’s happening fundamentally. It’s two different directions.”Read More: OPEC+ Shock Cut Aims to Make Oil Speculators Think TwiceOne thing that is certain: A major shift of market control into the hands of Saudi Arabia and its allies has now been cemented, with huge implications for geopolitics and the world’s economy.Investors have continued to reward US drillers for production discipline, making it unlikely that shale companies will ever again undertake the kind of disruptive growth that helped to keep energy inflation tame last decade. That leaves the oil market under the purview of OPEC+ at a time when some experts have predicted that demand is heading to a record.Story continues“The surprise OPEC cuts have already triggered fears of a resurgence in inflation,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, a lead index trader at commodities brokerages Marex Group Plc. “These renewed inflation concerns should only increase” in the months ahead, he said.Here is an overview of what traders will be watching in the oil market.Summer DemandThe timing of OPEC’s decision has struck an odd chord for many oil experts.The production cuts don’t take effect until May, and much of the repercussions are likely to be felt in the second half of the year. That’s a time when oil demand typically reaches its seasonal peak, partly thanks to the busy summer driving season in the US. It’s also the point when China’s economic reopening is expected to start swinging into full gear, further underpinning demand.Typically, OPEC would want to take advantage of that consumption burst by selling into the market as much as possible. Instead, the cut means the cartel is holding back. That’s sparking debate about whether the move will end up driving oil prices to $100 a barrel as demand surges, or whether, instead, the cartel and its allies are preparing for a recession-marked summer of tepid consumption.“While OPEC+ cuts on the surface are generally seen as bullish, it does also raise concerns over the demand outlook,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING. “If OPEC+ were confident in a strong demand outlook this year, would they really feel the need to cut supply?”Moves in global fuel markets underscore the demand skepticism. While oil prices rallied, moves for refined products were less pronounced, shrinking margins for refiners across Europe and the US. In Asia, prices of diesel, a key refinery product, are signaling heightened slowdown concerns as timespreads shrink to their lowest since November.Elevated StockpilesWhile US inventories have been declining, global inventories are still high.In the first quarter, commercial oil stockpiles held in OECD countries were sitting about 8% above last year’s levels, according to estimates from the US Energy Information Administration. That’s a fairly sizeable buffer and a sign of the weakness in consumption that’s plagued the market in the past few months.“You do need to chew through that overhang first before we can see we upside,” said Gallarati of Energy Aspects.Russian FlowsOil bulls have waited in vain for a Russian output cut promised for March to show up. The Kremlin said it would slash production by 500,000 barrels a day in March in retaliation for import bans and price caps imposed by “unfriendly countries.” But there’s been no sign of lower Russian output showing up in the one measure that matters to global crude markets — the number of barrels leaving the country.Crude shipments from Russia’s ports hit a new high in the final week of March, topping 4 million barrels a day. That’s 45% higher than the average seen in the eight weeks before Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine and has been boosted by the diversion since January of about 500,000 barrels a day delivered by pipeline directly to Poland and Germany.Shale’s Production DisciplineIt wasn’t long ago that there were two major players that oil traders turned to for direction over supplies: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the US shale industry.At the time, OPEC and shale were locked in a battle for market share. It was a feud that helped to keep global oil prices — and energy-driven inflation — at bay for the better part of decade.Then the pandemic hit, and with it an oil price rout that suffocated the shale industry. For the last three years, even as the market recovered and cash flow surged, companies have prioritized dividends and share buybacks over new drilling. It’s been a winning strategy. Since March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Energy Sector Index has surged almost 200%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 60% gain.Now, as calls for peak shale output gather pace, OPEC has one less factor to consider when making supply decisions.That’s a sore spot for President Joe Biden, who was quick to downplay the impact of the decision by the cartel and its allies to cut output by more than 1 million barrels per day. Biden vowed after an initial production cut last year that there would be “consequences” for Saudi Arabia, but the administration has yet to follow through.Read More: Investors Unloaded Saudi Arabian Bonds After Surprise OPEC+ MoveFutures CurveTalk of $100 oil has been buzzing since the end of last year, but it seems like the can keeps getting kicked down the road. First, some analysts had predicted prices would reach that threshold in the second quarter of 2023. The view got pushed into the second half of the year, and now even some of the bigger bulls aren’t expecting the magic number to come into play until 2024.The oil futures curve is reflecting those expectations. Prices for contracts tied to deliveries as far out as December 2024 and 2025 have rallied, even as benchmark front-month futures are starting to ease.“The OPEC+ output cut certainly raises the possibility of $100 a barrel this year, although it is by no means a certainty,” said Harry Altham, an analyst at brokerage StoneX. “Demand-side weakness stemming from growth considerations is clearly taking a more prominent role.”--With assistance from Julian Lee, Grant Smith, Chunzi Xu, Kevin Crowley and Mitchell Ferman.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New WorldScaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTXApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaAI Is Moving Fast Enough to Break Things.

29,9afcdd92-6240-3a7b-9a2f-6932b2c43c73,GD,2023-04-09,Here's Why General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-general-dynamics-nyse-110039948.html,1681038039,STORY,['GD'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics What Is General Dynamics's Net Debt?As you can see below, General Dynamics had US$10.5b of debt at December 2022, down from US$11.5b a year prior. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.24b, its net debt is less, at about US$9.25b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is General Dynamics' Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that General Dynamics had liabilities of US$15.3b due within a year, and liabilities of US$17.7b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.24b and US$11.8b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$20.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since General Dynamics has a huge market capitalization of US$62.4b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).We'd say that General Dynamics's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.7), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 12.6 times, makes us even more comfortable. Fortunately, General Dynamics grew its EBIT by 5.0% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Dynamics's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, General Dynamics recorded free cash flow worth 73% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like General Dynamics is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for General Dynamics   you should know about.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Needham increased its price target to $525 from $450, Truist Financial raised its target to $608 from $533, and Credit Suisse hiked its target to $580 from $475.And, showing confidence in its outlook, MPWR raised its dividend by 33% to $1 per share.MPWR has a very high beta of 1.65.Maxeon (MAXN)Solar panels in an open area, with the sun shining over them; solar stocksSource: ShutterstockSolar module maker Maxeon (NASDAQ:MAXN) is benefiting from the growth of solar energy and the large increases in demand for rooftop solar in the U.S. and Europe in particular amid rapidly rising electricity prices.

With inflation, geopolitical crises, and a potential recession all causing economic uncertainty, investors are seeking safe investments with a strong margin of safety.And few investors have proven more capable of finding these sorts of investments than Warren Buffett. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), has generated one of the most impressive track records in financial history. And Buffett is particularly well-known for his ability to find investments during panics, such as previous banking crises.This takes us to 2023. What sorts of undervalued Buffett stocks to buy stand out most today? These three picks combine several attractive features: They’re all selling at a significant discount to the S&amp;P 500 while being strong franchises and holding substantial prospects for share price appreciation when market sentiment improves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBank of America (BAC)bank of America stock BAC stockSource: ShutterstockBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is Berkshire-Hathaway’s second-largest holding, only trailing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And, as of today, BAC stock is perhaps the most undervalued of all its holdings as well.Bank of America shares have slumped 30% over the past year, including a large drop in March. Traders are nervous about the current problems in the banking sector.However, Bank of America is hardly the firm that investors should be worried about. The crisis is centered around regional banks, which have smaller deposit bases and more niche business models. The too-big-to-fail banks, like Bank of America, will be beneficiaries as money flows to larger and safer franchises.Regardless, thanks to the latest sell-off, BAC stock is dirt cheap. Shares go for eight times forward earnings and now offer a 3.1% dividend yield as an added benefit.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comStory continuesJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of Berkshire’s smaller holdings, with the firm currently owning an approximately $50 million stake in JNJ stock. This might be a good time for Buffett to up that position size.That’s because Johnson &amp; Johnson shares have fallen nearly 20% recently. That’s a huge move for such a stable low-volatility blue chip company as this one. J&amp;J’s tremendous diversity of products across pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer wellness items have given it incredible stability over the decades.Perhaps traders are nervous about the upcoming spin-off of Kenvue, which will be the new name of J&amp;J’s consumer products division. However, management believes that it will create more shareholder value by separating the wellness items from the rest of the business. In any case, it gives shareholders the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this new publicly-traded enterprise later in 2023.For now, JNJ stock is available below 15 times forward earnings, which is a rare bargain for this particular company. Shares also yield 2.9%.Charter Communications (CHTR)The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBerkshire’s position in Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) also offers considerable value. Up until about 2021, cable stocks were flying high as the industry could do no wrong.Since then, however, the pandemic-driven surge in consumer sign-ups has receded. Meanwhile, rising competition, heavy investments in new infrastructure, and high levels of leverage have cast the sector in a poor light. Charter’s debt, in particular, has concerned some folks now that interest rates are soaring, which could lead to a higher interest burden in the future.That said, this is all baked into the price and then some. Charter stock has lost more than half its value since its 2021 peak, including a steep 35% decline just over the past 12 months.The cable industry has its problems, no doubt. But demand isn’t going anyway, especially for home broadband connections. Telecom is known for being a recession-resistant industry. And now, with CHTR stock at just 11 times forward earnings, shares are priced for major upside once the current sentiment cycle improves.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BRK-B and JNJ stock.

In bull markets, it’s easier to pick top-performing growth stocks. In bear markets, we have to dig a bit deeper and seek out high-quality companies. That’s got investors looking for the most undervalued blue-chip stocks.Blue-chip stocks are often on investors’ radar because they tend to perform well over long stretches of time. The hope is that these stocks keep pace or exceed the performance of the S&amp;P 500 during bull markets and hold up better than the index during bear markets.Admittedly, that’s a tough ask. However, that’s what we’re after when looking for the best stocks to buy. Let’s look at a few undervalued blue-chip stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDeere (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comHow much growth does Deere (NYSE:DE) have left in it? To be honest, I’m not sure. But I do know that the company keeps knocking it out of the park. Shares are down about 4% over the past year, but have increased by 193% over the last three years.Analysts expect roughly 31% earnings growth in 2023 on revenue growth of 13.4%. In other words, Deere is pumping out some solid growth for its business. For this, investors are paying just 13 times earnings. Not to mention, it recently delivered strong results and raised its full-year outlook.The stock doesn’t have the most robust dividend payout, yielding just 1.25%. However, that shouldn’t stop investors from taking a closer look at the name. The one hang up buyers may encounter is a potential recession. A large economic slowdown will send buyers into stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and out of cyclical names like Deere.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Animated image of different medicationsSource: Olga Kononok/ShutterstockI have been writing a lot about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) lately, but it’s hard not to, especially when looking at undervalued blue-chip stocks. The company behind many health and hygiene brands like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Listerine and Johnson’s is a dividend stud, having raised its payout for 60 consecutive years. In April, investors expect the company to do so once again. Currently, the yield is just under 3%.Story continuesWhile the company is not blowing away investors with its growth, it’s quite consistent. Analysts expect roughly 3% revenue growth this year and next year, alongside roughly 3.5% earnings growth in 2023 and 2024.However, it’s not like we’re paying 25 to 30 times earnings for this growth. Instead, JNJ shares trade at roughly 15 times this year’s earnings estimates. That’s incredibly reasonable for the consistency we’re getting here.When shares of a blue-chip stock go on sale, it’s best to do some shopping. That’s exactly the case here, as shares previously declined in nine straight weeks.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comNo one wants to buy energy stocks at the top of the cycle, nor do they want to buy energy stocks ahead of a potential recession. Like Deere, investors in Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and energy stocks in general will need to keep an eye on how these stocks trade.However, the reality is that these stocks command low valuations and high dividend yields amid a period of robust cash flow. While oil and natural gas prices have been under pressure, they have started to rebound in recent trading.From the March 20 low to the high on April 4, crude oil has climbed over 27%. Natural gas prices are closer to a low than a high at this point, so it could become a catalyst down the road too.As it pertains to Chevron, the company recently raised its annual dividend payout to more than $6 a share. As a result, it sports a yield of 3.6%.Further, the company recently announced a $75 billion buyback plan. Given the company’s market cap of just $322 million, that’s a significant buyback plan. Despite down-to-flat growth expectations over the next 20 months, Chevron’s robust cash flow should generate shareholder value.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in JNJ.

Also featuring on the weekly schedule will be Wednesday morning's inflation reading from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the monthly retail sales report out Friday morning.Last week, markets were little-changed during a holiday-shortened trading week with U.S. markets closed for Good Friday. The Dow rose about 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 was fractionally lower and the Nasdaq fell about 1%.The main event last week came with markets closed on Friday as the March jobs report showed hiring slowed in the U.S. economy last month, though likely not by enough to forestall another rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed there were 236,000 jobs added to the economy last month while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%.Wall Street economists were largely in agreement on Friday that another 0.25% increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate is likely coming on May 3, but that this would be the final rate hike of the current cycle.""Overall the [March jobs] numbers still indicate that labor markets are developing the way the Fed would like, though perhaps not quite quickly enough,"" said Theodore Littleton, senior economist at IFR Markets, in an email on Friday.""It certainly doesn't dissuade the FOMC from getting in at least one last rate hike, with wage gains lower but still running at a rate that they don't consider consistent with their overall inflation target.""Data from the CME Group showed Friday investors are placing a roughly 70% chance on the Fed raising rates next month.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Key to this calculation, of course, will be Wednesday's CPI data, which is expected to show headline inflation rose 0.2% over the last month and 5.2% over the last year in March, an increase that would mark the slowest pace of consumer price increases since August 2021.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy, prices are expected to rise 0.4% over the prior month and 5.6% over last year in March.This would mark the first time since January 2021 that ""core"" inflation rose more against the prior year than the headline reading.A persistent rise in the cost of shelter, which rose 8.1% over the last year in February, has kept core inflation elevated. In a press conference last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation in the housing market coming down — which has largely been driven by rent renewals from a year ago — ""is really a matter of time passing.""""We forecast that next week's CPI report will show only modest deceleration,"" wrote Barclays economists led by Marc Giannoni in a note to clients last week.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.On the earnings side, all eyes will be on how ripples from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month impacted the country's biggest banks.In recent weeks, smaller regional banks like Western Alliance (WAL) and First Republic (FRC) have sought to calm investor nerves by offering updates on any deposit outflows. JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo were part of a consortium last month that injected some $30 billion in deposits into First Republic to shore up the struggling lender.Last week, data from the Federal Reserve showed another $65 billion in deposits left the U.S. banking system, with Bloomberg's Alex Tanzi noting most of this decline came from large banks. In each of the prior two weeks some $120 billion flowed out of small banks while some $126 billion left the overall banking system during the week ended March 22.In his annual letter to shareholders published last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote: ""As I write this letter, the current crisis is not yet over, and even when it is behind us, there will be repercussions from it for years to come.""Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, arrives to testify during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Hearing on the Annual Oversight of the Nation's Largest Banks, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, September 22, 2022.

But avoiding a 2008-like scenario, in Dimon's view, does not make this bank crisis a good thing by any means.""Any crisis that damages Americans' trust in their banks damages all banks — a fact that was known even before this crisis,"" Dimon wrote.""While it is true that this bank crisis 'benefited' larger banks due to the inflow of deposits they received from smaller institutions, the notion that this meltdown was good for them in any way is absurd.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
38,f8c169ed-8cd5-36cc-b42a-44144cb540ee,WFC,2023-04-09,Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) shareholders have endured a 14% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-nyse-wfc-shareholders-140019923.html,1680962419,STORY,['WFC'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), since the last five years saw the share price fall 26%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 22%. Furthermore, it's down 11% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Looking back five years, both Wells Fargo's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 5.1% per year. This change in EPS is reasonably close to the 6% average annual decrease in the share price. This implies that the market has had a fairly steady view of the stock. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Wells Fargo's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Wells Fargo the TSR over the last 5 years was -14%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 9.2% in the twelve months, Wells Fargo shareholders did even worse, losing 20% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA downstream energy specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) focuses primarily on refining, transporting, and marketing hydrocarbon resources.

It’s a higher-risk name among undervalued energy stocks to buy, with a market cap of only $121.5 million. Since the Jan. opener, EPSN slipped over 17%.Still, if you can overlook some of the challenges associated with Epsilon, it could be an intriguing target for speculation. Notably, the market prices EPSN at a trailing multiple of 3.56. As a discount to earnings, Epsilon ranks better than 79.23% of sector peers. Also, EPSN trades at 4.12 times FCF, coming in favorably below nearly 74% of competitors.In addition, Epsilon benefits from a cash-rich balance sheet.

Though it features a massive footprint, that hasn’t helped its market performance. Since the Jan. opener, DINO fell almost 10%.Nevertheless, the company brings an enticing narrative to the table for those seeking undervalued energy stocks to buy. For one thing, it’s undervalued relative to trailing earnings. However, the market also prices DINO at a forward multiple of 5.21. As a discount to projected earnings, HF Sinclar ranks better than 65.74% of companies listed in the oil and gas sector.Operationally, the enterprise runs a three-year revenue growth rate of 21.8%, outpacing 76.54% of its rivals.

Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels and other hydrocarbon products, PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) may be an unsung hero among undervalued energy stocks to buy. Fortunately, astute investors recognize the opportunity inherent in PBF shares. Since the Jan. opener, they moved up over 6%. In the past 365 days, they gained nearly 57%, a blistering performance.Despite the gains, there may be more room for growth. Conspicuously, PBF’s price-earnings ratio sits at a ridiculously low 1.76 times. Further, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 5.17. As a discount to projected earnings, PBF Energy ranks better than 72.22% of companies in the oil and gas space. Also noteworthy, PBF trades at 0.12 times sales, favorably below 91.76% of the competition.The company benefits from decent stability in the balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 5.11. Operationally, it posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, above 77.44% of the industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg PBF as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $52.22, implying nearly 31% upside potential.Seadrill (SDRL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comArguably the most speculative name on this list of undervalued energy stocks to buy, Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) is a deepwater drilling contractor for the petroleum industry. Interestingly, Seadrill operates semi-submersible platforms, jack-up rigs, and drillships. Since the beginning of the year, SDRL gained nearly 27% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, SDRL swung up almost 16%.While it enjoyed a significant push higher, Seadrill’s significantly undervalued on paper. Currently, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 1.19. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 96% of the field. To be fair, investors should be careful about extreme figures since SDRL might be a value trap.That said, Seadrill features an Altman Z-Score of 6.09, reflecting better-than-average fiscal stability. Also, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.26 times, favorably lower than the sector median stat of 1.65 times. Finally, SDRL lacks analyst coverage so you’ll be gambling on your own. Still, with cynically favorable fundamentals, Seadrill could be worth a look.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Pinnacle West Capital is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.04 = US$830m ÷ (US$23b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Pinnacle West Capital has an ROCE of 4.0%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.7%. View our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Pinnacle West Capital compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Pinnacle West Capital here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Pinnacle West Capital Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Pinnacle West Capital doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 5.9% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.The Key TakeawayEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Pinnacle West Capital. In light of this, the stock has only gained 25% over the last five years. Therefore we'd recommend looking further into this stock to confirm if it has the makings of a good investment.Story continuesIf you want to know some of the risks facing Pinnacle West Capital we've found 3 warning signs (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.While Pinnacle West Capital isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

We’ll always need to keep the lights on. How we’ll do that is where opportunity comes a-knocking.As it stands, hydrogen currently makes up about 0.1% of the global energy mix. By 2050, that will need to jump to 10% if we’re to hit net zero. As with most energy stocks, barriers to entry in this field are relatively high, so picking companies with boots already on the ground is a good way to build a position in the industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor the more conservative among us, choosing a well-diversified stock might be the best option. These companies operate within the industrial gas industry and have plenty of experience with hydrogen. Their green hydrogen business isn’t driving the car, but it’s a future growth avenue that management is actively investing in.These companies won’t deliver the same outside returns as the market grows, but they also tend to be much less volatile. APDAirProducts$282.71BLDPBallard Power System$4.99PLUGPlug Power$9.78AirProducts (APD)Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.Source: Bjoern Wylezich / ShutterstockAir Products (NYSE:APD) probably isn’t first to spring to mind for hydrogen stocks, but that will probably change soon. The group has a huge international industrial gas business supplying a wide range of industries from healthcare to electronics.But it also means it’s far from being a pure play in green hydrogen. That could change in the years ahead. The group is funnelling excess cash into green and low-carbon hydrogen projects that should put it on the map.Given its extensive experience in the industrial gas business, chances are good it will be successful in bringing these projects online. Reliable cashflows mean investment in this part of the business isn’t taking away from its existing growth engine.Story continuesStability comes at a price, though, APD stock isn’t cheap. The group’s valuation has been on the rise, which increases the possibility of volatility. Investors are expecting big things from APD and although the company looks able to deliver, there are no guarantees.Ballard Power SystemsHydrogen logo on gas stations fuel dispenser, symbolizing H2 combustion engine for emissions-free eco-friendly transport.Source: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.comBallard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP)is a much more focused pick among hydrogen stocks. The company makes fuel cell products for a range of industries including transportation and energy. Ballard’s been growing its presence in Europe substantially, with contracts in the region making up well over half of its total order backlog.This is a positive given the focus on energy independence and clean energy has been gaining momentum quickly compared to the pace in the US and elsewhere.Ballard is a volatile pick and in a somewhat precarious position. The fourth quarter disappointed the market after revenue fell more than expected. It caused a flurry of downgrades and the share price tanked. This offers an interesting entry point, though. While Ballard is no doubt struggling, it’s well-positioned to run away with an enormous slice of the European market. Partners like Audi, Daimler and Siemens mean the group’s working with a lot of resource, and that should stand it in good stead as the industry develops.Still, there’s plenty of risk attached to Ballard stock, especially since the group hasn’t turned a profit consistently.Plug Power (PLUG)Source: ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG)is another pure play within hydrogen stocks— and like Ballard, it is a wildcard. The company has been plugging along toward full vertical integration across the whole green hydrogen value chain.It’s built out expertise in everything from producing green hydrogen to distributing usable, liquefied green hydrogen. They did much of the building via acquisitions, and we have yet to fully see the fruits of these efforts.Management says profits are around the corner and that breakeven could be achieved as soon as this year, but investors are understandably dubious. There has been no sign of black ink on the bottom line yet and no guidance at the latest earnings report.Still, with major customers like Amazon on the books, Plug is in a good place to benefit from growing green hydrogen demand. Plus investors have started losing faith in the group’s growth prospects, so an upside surprise could be in store if Plug can deliver on its promises. On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of M&amp;T Bank. See our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About M&amp;T Bank?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.M&amp;T Bank already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at M&amp;T Bank's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in M&amp;T Bank. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.7% and 6.7% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of M&amp;T BankThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of M&amp;T Bank Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$101m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over M&amp;T Bank. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for M&amp;T Bank that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

63,5101cae5-6a22-35cb-b67e-16f671aedc82,CMCSA,2023-04-09,Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 85% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-favoured-140025637.html,1680962425,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Comcast's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 19 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Comcast. View our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Comcast does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Comcast's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Comcast. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.5% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 9.5% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.8% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Brian Roberts directly holds 0.9% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of ComcastThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Comcast Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.5b worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Comcast  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Growth stocks may be less-enticing in this environment, but bonds and other dividend stocks to buy certainly make a compelling case for investors in this market.For those looking past fixed-income and alternative investments like real estate, dividend stocks have a lot to offer investors. Dividend-paying stocks that provide dependable income streams in times of economic stability are highly valued, for good reason. That’s because when it hits the fan, you want to own companies that can continue to return value to shareholders.Of course, identifying companies that can do so is easier said than done. Long-term dividend stocks to buy can take many forms.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, I’m going to highlight three of my top picks. Let’s dive in.DVNDevon Energy$53.18QSRRestaurant Brands$66.20TXNTexas Instruments$176.40Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy firm engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and gas liquids. The company’s predominant operations focus on the United States mainlands, comprising five distinct areas: the Delaware, Eagle Ford, Powder River, Anadarko and Williston.Investors focus on Devon for two reasons. First, this is one of the best operators in terms of shale oil in the U.S., with impressive metrics to back up this view. Second, Devon has among the most attractive dividends of its peers.Devon pays out a variable dividend, which increases and decreases along with the price of oil. Thus, over the past year, surging oil prices led to a massive special dividend for investors. The company’s trailing dividend yield of 10% speaks to this.While many investors may consider such a yield to be unsustainable (and it probably is), oil is on the move higher again. This week’s news that OPEC+ isn’t playing nice with the U.S. has boosted DVN stock big time. I think this could be a bigger win for U.S. oil companies than anyone else (the consumer is about to feel the pinch at the pump again).Story continuesOil prices will eventually find their equilibrium, which is probably lower than where prices are right now. Renewable energy is coming, and this is a sector that’s been highly cyclical.That said, DVN stock is one of the top dividend stocks to buy right now, in my books.Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockReaders who follow my columns know how passionate I am about Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR). Much of this has to do with the fact that it’s one of the dividend stocks to buy for those seeking a modicum of defensiveness in this current market.Various macro uncertainties remain high right now. There’s surging inflation, a banking crisis underway (that may not be completely over) and geopolitical conflict and tension everywhere. In this environment, it can be hard to invest in certain industries, for fear that consumer confidence (and spending) may dry up.However, for companies like Restaurant Brands, parent company of Burger King, Tim Horton’s, Popeye’s and Firehouse Subs, any time is a good time to invest in this name.If times are good, folks have more money to spend, and will choose to dine out more frequently. If a recession hits, then that casual fine dining restaurant gets replaced by the Burger King down the street, and Restaurant Brands takes more market share.Thus, this company has a business model that’s more of a “heads I win, tails you lose,” from the perspective of the consumer. For investors, that should be music to the ears right now.Currently, QSR stock pays a dividend yield of 3.3%, which is overlooked. The company’s growth prospects outshine its robust dividend, which has also consistently grown over the years. Over the long-term, this is one of the top dividend stocks to buy now.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the dividend stocks to buy that I haven’t covered very often. There are reasons for this, but mainly, I don’t like the electronics manufacturing space overall.That said, Texas Instruments is a complex beast, with a range of businesses, from semiconductors to electronics manufacturing. The global operator focuses on two main segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. The Analog segment includes Power and Signal Chains, where the latter offers products that aid in managing electronic systems’ power.Texas Instruments’ equity value has increased by 10% since the start of this year. That’s impressive, considering the fact that this isn’t a tech stock many would group into the “high-growth” category (those have done much better than the industrial names this year). Texas Instruments is a company I’d put in the middle of a tech stock and an industrial stock. It’s hard to say how a company like Texas Instruments is supposed to perform in this market. In many respects, I’ve got a natural outlook on the stock from a growth standpoint.That said, it’s the company’s dividend that’s intriguing to me. Currently, Texas Instruments pays out a yield of 2.7%. That’s nothing to write home about. But in the tech sector (if you can call this a tech stock), that’s a meaningful yield. For those seeking growth, TXN stock provides an option that pays a little additional yield, increasing long-term investors’ total return. That’s something worth considering.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in QSR. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

It is one of the most watched indicators of overall stock market direction and includes 30 of the largest publicly traded firms. Thus, Dow stocks tend to get their fair share of attention from investors, due to their size and importance to the economy.The Dow represents the most significant industrial components of the U.S. economy. Thus, this index is often viewed as a way to measure the overall economic health of the U.S. So, one way to think of investing in Dow stocks, is that investors are making a bet that a particular industry is set to expand.With that in mind, let’s look at 3 Dow stocks to consider this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAXPAmerican Express$162.56MCDMcDonald’s$282.28AMGNAmgen$247.53American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is precisely the kind of stock investors should consider at any time, especially now. The economy is turbulent. Therefore, any firm that can thrive in such conditions deserves particular attention. And that’s exactly what American Express is doing.Indeed, 2022 was an excellent year for the credit card firm that serves a more affluent customer base. Revenues grew by 25%, reaching $52.86 billion. This came as processing volume rose 21%. Yes, net income and earnings per share declined overall in 2022. However, due to volatility, American Express had to increase its provisions for credit losses. That explains the modest declines in those areas.The company also increased its customer base by a record 12.5 million accounts in the year. Additionally, the company is expecting 15-17% revenue growth in 2023, anticipating that earnings will exceed 2021 levels. Company leadership is confident that American Express’s excellent customer base and non-banking business insulate it from broader economic headwinds.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comThere’s plenty of reason to believe McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock is a strong bet throughout 2023. Last year was a strong year for the fast-food giant. Sales increased 10% for the year on a year-over-year basis. And momentum continues to be strong, with fourth-quarter sales increasing by 12%.One way to understand why McDonald’s has thrived lately is to understand its strategy. That strategy is referred to as Accelerating the Arches, at the corporate level. It relies on core products centered around burgers, coffee, and chicken. If you’ve been to a McDonald’s in the last year, you’ve likely recognized the pared-down menu.One of the most important and highly-relevant aspects of McDonald’s strategy is its marketing focus on affordability. Prices of almost everything have increased, but McDonald’s remains one of the cheaper fast food options. It’s reasonable to assume that McDonald’s will continue to see strong demand as we head toward Q3 and Q4.That’s because economists increasingly suggest that a recession is more likely to hit, as credit risk piles up. In that scenario, affordability becomes even more paramount, making McDonald’s more appealing.Amgen (AMGN)Source: ShutterstockAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a leading pharmaceutical stock. As such, it relies on a vast portfolio of drugs to provide continued revenue growth over the long-term. Thus far, that cycle has continued indefinitely, so pharmaceutical companies with blockbuster drugs at peak sales tend to perform best.Amgen is in a transitional period in which its best-seller, Enbrel, is slipping. Meanwhile, its up-and-coming drugs must pick up the slack. Fortunately, that’s what is occurring – Prolia is on track to become a blockbuster drug, as Enbrel risks losing that status.Prolia is an osteoporosis drug that accounted for $992 million in sales in 2022. That brings it close to the $1 billion annual sales threshold used to determine blockbuster medicines. Meanwhile, Enbrel accounted for $1.098 billion in 2022 sales, down 1% year-over-year.Amgen’s vast revenues increased by 1% in 2022. That’s not great. But what is encouraging is that Prolia sales increased by 14% in 2022, and lessened the blow from declining sales from drugs such as Enbrel. Further, although Amgen’s sales only grew by 1% in 2022, its earnings per share rose by 18%. That means Amgen was able to reward investors, even as its business was flat.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

73,6027830c-4a1d-3ac5-958b-6018274c0935,OXY,2023-04-09,The 7 Best Oil and Gas Stocks to Buy in April 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-oil-gas-stocks-230814478.html,1680736094,STORY,"['CL=F', 'OXY', 'PBR-A', 'XOM', 'EGY', 'EPM', 'MRO']","[With crude oil prices zooming back above $80 per barrel, you may be wondering about the best oil and gas stocks to buy. A further rise in spot petroleum prices could spark a bigger rally in energy stocks, which have perked up after trending lower in early 2023.Some may argue that oil’s latest rally, driven by surprise news of production cuts from OPEC+, will not last. Yet, several analysts have argued that, with the prospect of more preemptive supply cuts from OPEC+ and the rebound in demand from China, oil prices have more room to run.If factors such as a further economic slowdown in the U.S. and Europe counter this, at the very least crude prices may be able to hold steady. Or energy stocks could continue to rally with the market re-rating the sector to a higher valuation as concerns about a drop back to pre-2022 oil prices diminish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you’re bullish on the sector, here are seven of the best oil and gas stocks to buy right now, which run the gamut from household names to under-the-radar plays.EGYVAALCO Energy$4.93EPMEvolution Petroleum$6.62MROMarathon Oil$25.69OXYOccidental Petroleum$64.57PBRPetroleo Brasileiro$10.87STRSitio Royalties$24.37XOMExxon Mobil$116.99VAALCO Energy (EGY)Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comBefore diving into some of the best large-cap oil and gas stocks to buy, let’s take a look at a smaller independent exploration and production (E&amp;P) company. In addition to the recent rise in oil prices, Houston-based VAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) is appealing for three reasons.First, EGY stock trades at a low valuation of 4.3 times earnings, and there may be a path to multiple expansion. As I’ve argued previously, VAALCO’s merger last year with Canada’s TransGlobe Energy made the company more geographically diversified. In time, this could result in investors re-rating the stock to a higher earnings multiple, somewhere in the mid to high single digits.Story continuesSecond, even if multiple expansion isn’t in the cards, shares could still move higher in tandem with earnings growth stemming from cost-reduction synergies. Third, total returns could be boosted by EGY’s recently raised dividend, which gives it a forward yield of 5.5%.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)Image of an oil wells with a dark blue skySource: ShutterstockEvolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is another small independent E&amp;P company. While this microcap energy stock doesn’t have a large following, plenty of investors seeking high yields have caught onto this opportunity.The stock has a dividend yield of 7.1%. With a payout ratio of 36%, this payout is likely sustainable if energy prices hold up. But EPM’s above-average yield isn’t the only thing to be excited about. There is also the potential for a high level of price appreciation, irrespective of whether crude oil zooms back above $100 per barrel or trades sideways from here.As stated in the company’s February investor presentation, management remains focused on maximizing shareholder value through its dividend and accretive acquisitions of high-quality, low-risk energy assets.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comAfter looking at two smaller E&amp;P names, let’s turn to a more familiar name that is among the best oil and gas stocks to buy. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) bounced back in a big way during the 2021 oil recovery. It experienced a further boost when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spiked oil prices in early 2022.Since then, however, MRO stock has traded sideways. Yet, even as it may seem that oil and gas prices will need to revisit last year’s highs for Marathon to produce strong returns, that may not necessarily be the case.MRO could still produce solid long-term returns through aggressive return-of-capital efforts. Last year, Marathon bought back 15% of its outstanding shares and raised its dividend three times. Management plans to continue returning at least 40% of its free cash flow to investors.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has been making headlines lately, and not only because of the crude oil rally. As you may know, shares of this E&amp;P giant have become a favorite of legendary investor Warren Buffett.Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has been an investor in OXY since 2019, when it purchased $10 billion in preferred stock. Since then, Berkshire has been buying up common shares of OXY stock. After its latest addition of shares last month, Berkshire owns a 23.5% stake in the company.However, there’s more to OXY than merely riding Buffett’s coattails. Besides being one of the highest-quality oil stocks out there, Occidental also has a major “green” catalyst. Per Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vicki Hollub, the company’s carbon capture business could be a major contributor to OXY’s bottom line a decade from now.Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comPetroleo Brasileiro (NYSE:PBR), better known as Petrobras, may not seem like one of the best oil and gas stocks to buy due to political uncertainties. The election of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (or Lula, for short) as Brazil’s president last year has weighed on shares of this state-controlled integrated oil company.Early last month, pressure on PBR stock intensified, as Lula (a leftist, especially on economic issues) criticized Petrobras for its focus on dividends rather than on capital investments beneficial to Brazil’s growth. Yet, while jurisdictional risks are real with PBR, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should stay away.Negative sentiment has pushed shares to a bargain-basement valuation of less than 2 times earnings. Management has also assured investors that the company will keep paying “robust” dividends. If you are aware of the risks, it may be worthwhile to take a small, speculative position.Sitio Royalties (STR)photo of large oil well infrastructure in a field at sunsetSource: ShutterstockSitio Royalties (NYSE:STR) is a high-yield stock that I’ve talked about glowingly in recent months. In a nutshell, this company is in the business of acquiring oil and gas mineral and royalty interests.With management more focused on creating shareholder value than on building an energy empire, STR stock may be poised to produce strong returns if oil holds steady and especially if oil prices rally from here. Similar to the situation with Evolution Petroleum, Sitio is adept at making accretive acquisitions of energy assets. This could drive continued growth in cash flow.Sitio will plow a portion of this cash flow back into new acquisitions, but a lot of it will come back to shareholders, primarily in the form of dividends. STR’s payouts are variable, but if oil prices continue to trend higher, chances are STR will continue to sport a double-digit dividend yield.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is perhaps the first oil stock that comes to mind not only for most investors but for the general public as well. Yet, there is more than just “buy what you know” at play when it comes to arguing for XOM being one of the best oil and gas stocks to buy.For one, as InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier has discussed, the venerable integrated oil giant is in the midst of an aggressive cost-reduction program. With cost savings falling straight to the bottom line, this stands to continue boosting the valuation of XOM stock. The increased cash flow will also fuel Exxon Mobil’s buyback and dividend efforts.Not only that, as with Occidental, there’s a decarbonization catalyst in play too with XOM. In fact, CEO Darren Woods recently stated that its emerging decarbonization unit could start supplanting its legacy business a decade from now.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

That’s because the company pays you to hold your shares when you have a dividend stock. And that’s true of even the biggest of large-cap stocks.Most dividend-paying large-cap stocks issue payouts on a quarterly or monthly basis. If you are a younger investor, putting those payouts back into the stock makes sense to increase your position and grow your portfolio even faster. Once you get that money, it’s yours to do with as you see fit.But if you’re a retiree, you’re probably more inclined to take those payouts as income to supplement your other retirement accounts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEither way works, and I appreciate a company that cares for its shareholders.

The company’s stock is up nearly 90% in 2023, pushing the market capitalization to $689 billion.Nvidia produces chips that can produce amazingly advanced graphics highly prized by gaming applications and gaming centers. But with the popularity of the ChatGPT online chatbot developed by OpenAI, Nvidia is breaking new ground. It’s on Nvidia’s advanced graphics chips OpenAI is training its large language models. Nvidia is now making its DGX Cloud available online to give more businesses access to the infrastructure to develop artificial intelligence tools for themselves. The sky is the limit for NVDA at this point.Story continuesNvidia currently pays a minimal dividend. The payout ratio is 0.06%, but it’s still one of the more reliable dividend-paying large-cap stocks out there. I hope this company does a better job down the road of rewarding its shareholders with a payout. NVDA stock has a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.Microsoft (MSFT)In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) productsSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another of the dividend-paying large-cap stocks getting huge attention from ChatGPT and the growing AI trend. Microsoft partnered with OpenAI and uses the ChatGPT software to enhance searches on its Bing search engine and Edge web browser.The excitement helped push Microsoft shares up nearly 20% this year, with a market cap north of $2.1 trillion.As I wrote recently on my takeout on Microsoft, the company’s stock is also up on some positive news. It recently announced a plan to integrate AI technology into other platforms, including the planned Microsoft 365 Copilot. And these AI headwinds could also breathe new life into the Azure cloud computing segment.Microsoft, which provides a dividend yield of nearly 1%, has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comThey don’t get any bigger than Microsoft and the next company on our list. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of the iPhone, wearables and Mac computers, has a market cap of $2.6 trillion.It’s well on the way to becoming the first $3 trillion stock, particularly after gaining about 30% this year.Analysts are undoubtedly bullish about AAPL stock, citing robust demand for iPhones and strong interest in China. But I’m much more focused on the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. At that event, Apple could very well roll out its augmented reality/virtual reality headset product.It’s been a while since Apple’s shown us something entirely new, so the reception to such a product will impact AAPL stock. But if you need another reason to like Apple stock, consider the Services segment that includes the App Store and iCloud. Revenue from Services reached $19.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a new record for the company. That’s a significant trend considering that Apple gets a much higher profit margin on Services revenue than from items that require a lot of equipment and research, such as iPhones and headsets.Apple’s current dividend yield is 0.5%, and it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has upstream exploration and production facilities worldwide, including in the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico, Australia, Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstan, and sports a market cap of $324 billion.Chevron stock has been treading water the last few weeks, down about 5% on the year but showing a slight increase over the previous month. The stock appears to be gathering some steam to make another run higher, particularly now that OPEC announced it is cutting oil production.The rising oil price and demand for natural gas make Chevron a cash machine. The company brought in $35.5 billion in earnings in 2022 and doled out $11 billion in dividends while spending another $11.25 billion in share buybacks.With a dividend yield of 3.5%, CVX stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Coca-Cola (KO)a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cansSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.comFamed soda maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may be one of the best-known consumer brands on the planet. From its headquarters in Atlanta, Coca-Cola has become the world’s biggest non-alcoholic beverage company.That’s helped push Coca-Cola to a market capitalization of $270 billion, selling products in more than 200 countries around the world. But even with that massive footprint, the company believes it has a broad runway for growth. Coca-Cola claims it has a 14% market share in the developed world. But in the much larger developing and emerging world, Coca-Cola has roughly a 7% share.It has a vast arsenal of brands to market to those potential customers, including sodas and carbonated beverages, teas, coffees, water, sports drinks and juices. And it’s recently dipped its toes into alcoholic beverages by offering hard seltzers and canned mixed drinks.Earnings for the fourth quarter were $10.2 billion in revenue, beating analysts’ estimates for $9.93 billion revenue.

But it’s also a company in transition.The company struggled mightily during the Covid-19 pandemic before finally rebounding by mid-2021 to set all-time highs. But since then, Starbucks stock has struggled.Faced with high inflation and unionization issues, interim CEO Howard Schultz stepped down last month to make way for new CEO Laxman Narasimhan. Previously, Narasimhan was CEO of Reckitt Benckiser Group (OTCMKTS:RGBLY) and had executive positions with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Notably, SBUX stock is up 5% since the change in power. Starbucks is a brand constantly tinkering with its menu to develop something new. The most recent offering is oleato coffee, a coffee drink infused with extra virgin olive oil. It will have to continue to evolve if it will be successful under Narasimhan’s watch.With a market cap of $119 billion, SBUX offers a dividend yield of 2%.

78,061f3d96-67f6-3dc9-86c3-bab359ec708f,INTU,2023-04-09,3 Thrilling Hyper-Growth Stocks for Aggressive Investors to Buy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-thrilling-hyper-growth-stocks-172903946.html,1680715743,STORY,"['TWLO', 'ENPH', 'INTU']","[Many analysts have reached a consensus right now that the market has likely bottomed in the near term. The strength in the economy is robust, and the recent bank bailouts by the Federal Reserve have started to loosen monetary policy despite the rate hikes. Following a tumultuous 2022, tech stocks have made a striking comeback in 2023, drawing attention from investors seeking hyper-growth stocks to buy.The recovering confidence in the banking sector has diverted investor focus toward more cyclical names, creating a favorable environment for growth stocks. Analysts also anticipate the Federal Reserve may reconsider its rate hikes, leading to a potential resurgence in growth stocks.Of course, there are fears that the growth rally is overdone and the economy is due for a recession following the rate hikes. But with the Fed’s balance sheet undoing around four months of quantitative tightening, I believe the possibility of a recession is insignificant in the near term. The only worry is that inflation may start rising again if there is too much liquidity in the economy, which can cause some panic in the future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, investors should look into these three hyper-growth stocks to buy:Twilio (TWLO)The Twilio logo is seen on a smartphone. Twilio is a cloud communications platform as a service company based in San Francisco, California. TWLO stock.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWhile most other growth stocks have exploded in recent months, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) has remained overlooked. However, the stock is slowly making a comeback, up 16.7% year-to-date, but remains 86.5% below its February 2021 peak. I believe TWLO stock is poised for a resurgence this year as it is already building some momentum.The cloud communications platform enables developers to integrate various communication services into applications and has seen remarkable expansion since its 2016 IPO. While the inflation and interest rate increases pose some challenges, the outlook seems very optimistic as we advance.What’s more is that the company has been consistently beating analyst estimates. Twilio reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.02 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and substantially narrowed its losses from $482 million in Q3 to $229 million in Q4. That’s mainly due to the cost-cutting initiatives the company went through, such as reducing its workforce by 17%.Story continuesAdmittedly, the top-line growth is indeed slowing down. But investors also need to consider that Twilio’s growth will likely pick back up as the economy recovers. Many cyclical tech names use the company’s services, and the temporary slowdown shouldn’t warrant a low valuation.Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is another business the market has underappreciated so far. It specializes in financial software such as TurboTax, QuickBooks and Mailchimp. Sure, INTU stock still trades at a premium, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 63.8x. However, its forward P/E ratio is at 28.6x, meaning that analysts expect much higher earnings in the future. But what makes me really bullish about the stock is its remarkable margins. Its gross margin is at a remarkable 79%, while its net margin is at 14.2%, both ranked better than ~85% of other software companies. Furthermore, the three-year book growth rate (per share) is nearly 60%. That’s better than ~90% of its peers, showing that the company is rapidly building its asset base.Much like other companies, top-line growth has slowed down here too. But as the macroeconomic situation eases, I expect that to turn a corner. Five-star analyst Jim Kelleher shares my view that the stock has considerable upside potential. He expects a 33% upside potential from the current price, with a $580 target.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is too good to ignore now. While fossil fuel-reliant companies have likely peaked even with the recent OPEC production cut, Enphase Energy seems well-positioned to deliver outsized gains. Countries worldwide are accelerating their efforts to increase their renewable energy output, and solar remains one of the best ways to do so.First, Enphase Energy’s financials are shining green. Its three-year revenue growth rate is 50.4%, outperforming almost 95% of its peers. Even better, Enphase Energy’s three-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization growth is at 61%. I expect the growth to accelerate more as the solar trend picks up. But even with the current growth rate, its forward P/E ratio of 69.44x calls for more upside.Indeed, analysts think the same. The average Wall Street target is $293, with a 54.8% upside. Some analysts think it can go even higher, with Sophie Karp from KeyBanc expecting an 91.5% upside potential.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

79,b3b0edc1-c0e0-3cef-9f82-b99130bb85e1,LYB,2023-04-09,The 7 Most Promising Battery Stocks to Buy in April,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-promising-battery-stocks-172644106.html,1680715604,STORY,"['CBT', 'ALB', 'LYB', 'SQM', 'UNVR', 'CMT']","[Following the surge in oil prices as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations – an alliance known as OPEC+ – the narrative for the most promising battery stocks to buy in April got even more enticing. With rising fuel prices affecting practically everybody, greater interest will focus on advanced energy solutions.Certainly, electric vehicles play a significant role in fostering alternatives to fossil-fuel-supported transportation mechanisms. At the same time, battery stocks to buy undergird other technological innovations that offer relevancies toward renewable energy protocols.Thus, the silver lining regarding the OPEC+ cuts is that it might galvanize the global community to lessen geopolitical dependencies. Below are compelling battery stocks to buy this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCMTCore Molding Technologies$18.22LYBLyondellBasell Industries$93.43UNVRUnivar Solutions$35.02CBTCabot Corp.$74.58SQMSociedad Quimica$73.17LICYLi-Cycle Holdings$5.41ALBAlbemarle$196.31Core Molding Technologies (CMT)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWhile the concept of battery stocks to buy invariably focuses on the platform itself, investors should note opportunities in the broader, ancillary space. Specifically, Core Molding Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN:CMT) may provide diversified exposure. Specializing in sheet molding compounds, Core Molding represents a vital cog of the global EV ecosystem.Per its website, Core manufactures EV battery boxes or compartments/chambers designed to hold batteries. While it might seem mundane, it’s a powerfully relevant market idea. Notably, since the January opener, CMT gained 40% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 75%.Enticingly, the market prices CMT at a trailing multiple of 12.64. As a discount to earnings, Core ranks better than 61.2% of companies listed in the chemicals industry. In addition, CMT trades at 0.41 times sales, favorably below the sector median of 1.26 times. Plus, EF Hutton’s Chip Moore pegs CMT a buy. The expert forecasts shares hitting $19, which represents almost 4% upside potential.Story continuesLyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA multinational chemical company based in the Netherlands, LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is the largest licensor of polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. Regarding the topic of battery stocks to buy, LyondellBasell features expertise in battery-related innovations that undergird EVs and hybrid vehicles. Perhaps not surprisingly, LYB gained more than 11% of equity value since the start of the new year.Financially, LyondellBasell brings several positive attributes to the table. First, the company enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 3.15, reflecting modestly low bankruptcy risk. Second, LyondellBasell posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.1%, beating out 75.41% of rivals.Most enticingly for value investors, the market prices LYB at a forward multiple of 10.19. As a discount to projected earnings, LyondellBasell ranks better than 73.42% of companies in the chemicals industry. To be fair, Wall Street analysts peg LYB only as a hold. Still, their average price target is $98.60, implying almost 6% upside from here.Univar Solutions (UNVR)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA global chemical and ingredients distributor and provider of value-added services, Univar Solutions (NYSE:UNVR) might not seem like a natural addition to battery stocks to buy. However, as the underlying market expands, people must consider what to do with used-up batteries. Here, Univar entered into a partnership with another enterprise – which I’ll discuss later – to provide waste management solutions for lithium-ion batteries.So no, it’s not a direct play. Nevertheless, UNVR is incredibly relevant, making it a worthwhile idea among battery stocks to buy. Moreover, the company enjoys decent financials. For example, its Altman Z-Score runs at 3.02, again demonstrating modestly low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 15.4%, above 70% of companies in the chemicals industry.Also, the market prices UNVR at a forward multiple of 12.13. As a discount to earnings, Univer ranks better than 64.56% of its rivals. As with LyondellBasell above, analysts peg UNVR as a hold. That said, their average price target comes out to $37.45, implying almost 7% upside potential.Cabot Corp (CBT)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Cabot Corp (NYSE:CBT) is a specialty chemicals and performance materials company. According to its website, Cabot provides industry-leading additives which enable battery performance and safety. One of the top-performing battery stocks to buy this year, CBT gained 15% of equity value since the Jan. opener.Not only that, CBT gained over 39% in the trailing five years, demonstrating long-term relevancies. Better yet, the company features enticing financials. For starters, its Altman Z-Score of 3.65 indicates low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. On the profitability front, Cabot’s net margin pings at 8.15%, above 60.29% of the industry.Plus, the market prices CBT at a forward multiple of 11.57. As a discount to projected earnings, Cabot ranks better than 65.82% of sector peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CBT as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target stands at $95, implying nearly 26% upside potential.Sociedad Quimica (SQM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn oldie but a goodie in the realm of battery stocks to buy, Sociedad Quimica (NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean chemical firm. Primarily, it supplies plant nutrients, iodine, lithium, and industrial chemicals. Most notably per its public profile, SQM represents the world’s biggest lithium producer. Obviously, that status has significant implications for the global EV rollout, among other core applications.Financially, SQM enjoys very attractive metrics. On the balance sheet, it’s difficult not to notice the enterprise’s Altman Z-Score of 5.76, indicating a very low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 81.3%. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 36.4%.Despite these blistering stats, SQM owns an objectively undervalued profile. Presently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 4.99. As a discount to projected earnings, SQM ranks better than 98.1% of sector peers. Lastly, analysts peg SQM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $104, implying over 38% upside potential.Li-Cycle Holdings (LICY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comThe partner to the aforementioned deal with Cabot Corp, Li-Cycle Holdings (NYSE:LICY) focuses on sustainable processes for the recovery of critical materials from all types of lithium-ion batteries. By reintroducing these elements from lithium batteries into the supply chain, Li-Cycle may help address resource shortages as global powers compete for supplies. Therefore, LICY ranks among the most significant battery stocks to buy.Since the start of the year, LICY gained over 18% of its equity value, an impressive performance. In fairness, though, it lost 28% in the trailing one-year period. As well, investors will need to understand that Li-Cycle is an aspirational business. While it’s not pre-revenue, the amount it posts on the top line sometimes fails to exceed its cost of goods sold.So, aside from a relatively cash-rich balance sheet, Li-Cycle prints plenty of red ink in terms of profitability. Nevertheless, covering analysts peg LICY as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $8.14, implying almost 46% upside potential.Albemarle (ALB)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAn American specialty chemicals manufacturing firm, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) operates three divisions: lithium, bromine specialties, and catalysts. Per its public profile, as of 2020, Albemarle represented the largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Therefore, ALB easily ranks among the most relevant battery stocks to buy. Still, it hasn’t helped ALB this year, which dipped more than 2% since the start of Jan.For those that can be patient with battery stocks to buy, Albemarle presents enticing financial metrics. For a start, the company features a decent balance sheet, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.16. In contrast, the sector median value is 1.82. Operationally, Albemarle runs a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.6%, outclassing 86.2% of the field.Also, the market prices ALB at a forward multiple of 7.29. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 89.24% of its rivals. In closing, analysts peg ALB as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $308.69, implying over 47% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Selling at an average price of US$525, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$513. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Over the last year we saw more insider selling of UnitedHealth Group shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$1.6b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth Group Tell Us?The fact that there have been no UnitedHealth Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the UnitedHealth Group insiders selling. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for UnitedHealth Group.But note: UnitedHealth Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 75% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-120020371.html,1681041620,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Cisco Systems' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cisco Systems. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Cisco Systems already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cisco Systems' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Cisco Systems is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cisco Systems, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$55m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cisco Systems. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Cisco Systems , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It is because you can always start thinking about your retirement regardless of age or career stage.Furthermore, exploring stocks for retirement investment can provide an excellent opportunity to analyze some of the most successful companies.Investing for the long term can seem intimidating in today’s fast-paced world. Recent events, such as the pandemic, supply chain, inflation crisis, war in Ukraine, and bank collapses, have left investors uncertain about what to do next. Consequently, everyone is looking for safer investments to ensure stable returns. As a result, buying forever stocks has never looked this good as investors look to avoid a market crash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsConcentrating on businesses with established histories of consistent profits and cash flows can be a viable solution. Enterprises that have weathered prior economic downturns are more likely to thrive in the face of future market fluctuations.Moreover, diversifying across various sectors and industries can aid in securing a stable and growing dividend income for investors in the future.Consequently, retirement stocks are very attractive if you are looking for potential investments to buy. Here are three options you need to consider if you are looking to plan for your retirement and secure your future.Retirement Stocks to Buy: Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comAlthough hardware companies face low margins compared to software, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has transformed into a leading software provider. The company offers security, network monitoring, and collaboration software add-ons to its networking equipment. Consequently, Cisco is set up for long-term success, so it is folly to ignore this one when researching retirement stocks to buy.During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended on Jan. 28, the company’s revenue increased by 7% to $13.6 billion compared to the previous year.Story continuesFurthermore, Cisco’s adjusted earnings went up by 5% to $0.88 per share, surpassing the consensus forecast by two cents.Cisco’s strong results compared to its competitors during the recent technology demand slump highlights the effectiveness of its business model as it offers fundamental products essential for modern internet operations whose demand remains stable.Cisco’s growth in H1 of fiscal 2023 was driven by its secure and agile networks unit, comprising networking hardware like switches and routers. Supply chain disruptions hit this segment in 2022. Those issues have eased, allowing Cisco to meet the rising demand for its hardware as companies upgrade their infrastructure.CEO Chuck Robbins highlighted that despite macro headwinds, demand remained consistent, and win rates were stable during the conference call. Additionally, the growth of Cisco’s Internet of the Future unit stabilized after acquiring Acacia Communications last year. The end-to-end security unit continued to perform well, powered by its unified threat management and zero-trust services.At a last look, Cisco Systems’ price-to-earnings ratio is 18.98x, higher than its median of 16.64x over the past 10 years. Although the company’s highest P/E ratio in the last decade was 695, its current valuation is much more reasonable. Overall, Cisco’s P/E ratio indicates that the company’s stock may be slightly overvalued but within a reasonable range.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comOpting for significant financial institutions with astute management teams is beneficial when times are tough. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) excels in both aspects, earning high scores. The corporation adeptly managed the 2008 financial crisis and survived the COVID-19 shock without significant harm. That is why it is one of the top retirement stocks to buy.The banking crisis drives deposits from smaller regional banks to JPMorgan Chase, increasing business and profitability. Furthermore, the bank remains highly profitable and is likely to raise dividends in the future.Following the 2008 financial crisis, investors became wary of relying on the financial sector for dividend earnings. However, banks and insurance companies still offer a significant source of income in the S&amp;P 500, making them worth considering for investment.Furthermore, experience is worth its weight in gold in the banking sector. SVB Financial (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) and Silvergate (NYSE:SI) failed to position their balance sheets appropriately for the rising interest rates and suffered significant unrealized bond losses leading to their collapse.Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, successfully steered the bank through the Great Recession, highlighting the strength of the institution’s balance sheet. During the pandemic, JPMorgan regained its resiliency, further bolstering Dimon’s reputation as one of Wall Street’s most respected CEOs.While other banks invested excess deposits in government bonds to enhance yield and earnings during a sluggish lending activity, Dimon kept JPMorgan’s cash holdings higher, avoiding significant bond investments.JPMorgan Chase’s current P/E ratio stands at 10.63x, which is below its ten-year median of 11.61x. The company’s P/E ratio has ranged from a low of 7.39x to a high of 18.62x over the past decade, indicating fluctuations in its valuation. It is worth noting that JPMorgan Chase’s current P/E ratio is below its median, potentially indicating that the company is undervalued.Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is the second-most extensive wireless provider in the United States. It commands a market share of 30.4%, far surpassing T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), its closest competitor.Telecom is a stable industry, impervious to economic downturns, making it a preferred choice for conservative investors. Irrespective of financial conditions, individuals require their phones, sustaining demand.Telecom stocks, including Verizon, have declined recently due to the significant investment cycle in 5G. Nonetheless, these investments should commence generating profits in the upcoming years, leading to a surge in long-term profitability.Verizon’s high fixed costs for network expansion result in high margins on revenue, similar to software firms. Despite a 0.7% drop in service revenue to $109.6 billion in 2022, the gross margin was still impressive at 74%, while the wireless equipment segment had a negative 12.1% gross margin. Fortunately, wireless service revenue is expected to rise by 2.5% to 4.5% in 2023.Verizon must find innovative ways to use its network, including promoting its fixed wireless broadband service with over 1.4 million subscribers. In the last three months of 2022 alone, Verizon added 379,000 customers to this segment. Bundling smartphones, broadband, and streaming services can create new revenue streams and high margins.Furthermore, Verizon can boost cash flow by growing service revenue with fixed wireless and reducing capital expenditures. However, it operates in a competitive space, and others may also seize these opportunities. Despite the risks, Verizon’s low P/E ratio of 7.8 times and a high dividend yield of 6.58% make it an attractive investment option.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
