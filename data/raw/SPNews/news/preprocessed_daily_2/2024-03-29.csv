SWOBX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.', 'Objective', ""The world of Zacks' Allocation Balanced funds is an area filled with options, such as SWOBX. These funds like to invest in a variety of asset types, finding a balance between stocks, bonds, cash, and sometimes even precious metals and commodities; they are mostly categorized by their respective asset allocation. For investors, Allocation Balanced funds can provide an entry point into diversified mutual funds, and present core holding options for a portfolio of funds."", 'History of Fund/Manager', 'Schwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWOBX. Schwab Balanced Fund made its debut in October of 1996, and since then, SWOBX has accumulated about $585.14 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.', 'Performance', 'Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 7.43%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 3.74%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 12.24%, the standard deviation of SWOBX over the past three years is 12.95%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 12.73% compared to the category average of 12.75%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. SWOBX has a 5-year beta of 0.67, which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. With a negative alpha of -3.05, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Expenses', 'As competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWOBX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.02% compared to the category average of 0.81%. From a cost perspective, SWOBX is actually cheaper than its peers.', 'While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.', ""Your research on the Allocation Balanced segment doesn't have to stop here. You can check out all the great mutual fund tools we have to offer by going to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds to see the additional features we offer as well for additional information.

The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you, as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be two less workdays compared to this current fiscal year. Each quarter next year will have 65 workdays, which means, the first and the fourth quarters will each have one less workday than this fiscal year.

All of these contributed to improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year.

GasBuddy Head of Petroleum Analysis Patrick De Haan joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the upward trends in gas and oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F).', '""Americans are getting out more: the [solar] eclipse is a week away, but spring break travel is also happening. All three of those — demand, refinery maintenance, and the transition to summer gasoline — is all boosting prices, and it probably will continue another couple weeks yet before we plateau,"" De Haan says.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""- We've seen sharp rises in the cost of fuel overtaking oil and an unusual move in the market, drivers are forking out more than a quarter more now for a gallon of gas than they did a month ago, with some analysts saying, we could see gallon at $4 by May. For his view, let's bring in Patrick De Haan, Gasbuddy's head of petroleum analysis."", 'Patrick, it is always good to have you on the program. So this one\'s interesting, Patrick, unleaded gasoline I was reading 3.54 a gallon on average across the country on Wednesday. ""The Journal"" was pointing out it\'s up 3% from a year ago, Patrick, 14% than at the start of the year. What is driving this exactly?', ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, this is all seasonal, very expected. Three main reasons though from the seasonality boosting prices refinery maintenance happens at this time of year, almost every year. Refinery maintenance then also limits how much refineries can produce. That's happening at the same time that much of the nation, in fact, all the nation is switching to cheaper-- or excuse me, more expensive summer gasoline from cheaper winter gasoline, which has more butane. And demand is also going up."", 'Americans are getting out more, the eclipse is a week away, but spring break travels also happening. All three of those demand refinery maintenance and the transition to summer gasoline is all boosting prices, and it probably will continue another couple of weeks yet before we plateau.', ""- How far are we going to go then? We're talking $4 a barrel?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, I don't think we'll quite get to $4. Yeah, maybe 3.60 to 3.90 a gallon, somewhere there. I mean, oil prices have been rising in the background too. That's something that we'll have to keep an eye on here over the next couple of months."", ""OPEC maintaining a very delicate balance of production driving oil up to $82 to $83 a barrel. But I think we're going to stop short for now. There could be a caveat or hurricane, an additional geopolitical strife that we may have to concern with that could eventually push prices to $4. But I think that's going to be the exception if it does happen this summer, not the norm."", '- Any kind of upside risk to that call though, Patrick?', 'PATRICK DE HAAN: Oh, certainly without a doubt. As I mentioned, some of those caveats, some of the unknowns, certainly OPEC as well. Now, if the Fed does start to cut interest rates, that could start to heat the economy back up, it could push demand up.', ""There is a case that if the Fed starts cutting interest rates, depending on how consumers react to that, we could see growth and demand push gas prices a little bit closer to that $4 a gallon mark, or a major hurricane that could happen in August or September, and anything undeveloped, especially in Russia's invasion of Ukraine."", ""Now Ukraine's been fighting back, attacking Russian refineries. And there's only a finite amount of global refining capacity. So if that continues, that could also push the argument a $4 a gallon gas more towards reality."", ""- Patrick, you've listed a number of seasonal factors. There's geopolitical factors, but of course every time gas goes up, the Biden administration is watching this one closely, especially in an election year. If we get closer to that $4 a gallon level or if we pass that, is there a possibility of tapping into the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserves? In what's the capacity of that right now, just given how depleted it already is?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, the SPR is back north of half full. We're at about 363 million barrels, the SPR has gone up virtually every week for the last few months. I really think the Biden administration is not going to tap it, unless there's a massive spike in the price of oil."", ""Again, it is a Strategic Reserve, there's a strong argument that it was utilized last time, Russia's invasion of Ukraine causing oil to jump to 130, it was used then. But I think they're going to resist the temptation to use the SPR, knowing that it's not just the SPR that will have to lower prices, but it's also refineries turning that oil into gasoline, that's the wild card refineries."", ""Don't necessarily have to churn out gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, so it could depress prices. But again, I don't think the administration is going to use that, simply because they've been so focused on increasing the SPR ahead of the election. Either way, there's going to be politicians on both sides of the aisle that are going to start pointing fingers one way or another."", ""- And Patrick, I'm interested. We always talk about gas prices nationally, I'm also always interested to get your take on what's going on, just kind of regionally, Patrick, any stark differences there-- east, south, west?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, absolutely. The west often gets roasted when filling up. California's back above $5 a gallon. They have a very unique setup though in California. They're cut off from really a lot of the rest of the nation. They have a declining number of refineries that is tasked with keeping up with demand."", 'And keep in mind, they have their own blend of gasoline mandated by the Air Resources Board, which is the only state that can supersede EPA. So they have all these rules, high taxes carbon programs like cap and trade.', ""California's always among the highest. In fact, much of the West Coast also is above average, simply because they don't have the pipelines to connect each other, all these regions to the refineries that would be necessary. So the West Coast always takes the cake with the highest gas prices.""]"

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the\xa0Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In Now.', 'Investing in defensive sectors has always been a go-to strategy for investors who like to play it safe, which is why many new investors in particular are heavily drawn to these areas in the market. Traditionally, the main defensive sectors in the market are healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Over the past year, some financial professionals saw a trend of most investors avoiding defensive stocks, but this may come to an end in 2024, as John Mowrey, NFJ Investment Group\'s executive managing director and CIO, noted on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on January 30:', '""You\'ve been paid to avoid some of the more defensive areas because of higher interest rates. So if you look at utilities, if you look at staples, if you look at healthcare, all of these higher-yielding areas have been hollowed out because you\'ve been paid to avoid them. Everyone\'s been chasing the Mag 7 and the AI trend and then they\'re clipping coupons in fixed income. That\'s created a real opportunity in the more defensive areas. So should you get a bumpier period in the market, I think you\'ll get paid to be in those areas. So I like some of the more defensive areas.""', 'Mowrey believes that investors would be well-served to start moving into defensive areas as they are offering more attractive valuations, healthy dividends, and dividend growth, the last of which is a strong barrier against inflation. Considering these factors, many believe that defensive stocks are among the best beginner stocks to buy at present.', 'Considering the above, major fund managers are gravitating towards defensive investments. For instance, on February 21, Thomas Taw, the BlackRock APAC iShares Investment Strategy Head, joined ""Bloomberg Markets: Asia"" to discuss his recent moves. Taw noted that he is now positioning ""more defensively in equity portfolios"" instead of pursuing higher valuation companies and that he is particularly looking into more ""dividend type of investing.""', ""Investments in defensive sectors have been driving growth exponentially. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s healthcare sector outlook report for 2024 noted that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic propelled venture capitalists and investors to provide financial backing to the healthcare sector, resulting in investments in healthcare startups reaching all-time highs in 2021. The focus on tech in healthcare has also resulted in investors committing significant capital to medical technologies. Additionally, Deloitte's 2024 outlook on the utilities sector noted that the US Inflation Reduction Act's one-year anniversary marked the moment when investments worth at least $122 billion in clean-energy generation projects were confirmed. Like healthcare, the utilities sector is also increasingly turning to technology in its operations and goals for electrification, with Deloitte stating that 2024 will see power and utilities companies turning to artificial intelligence and other digital solutions as they work to transform the grid."", ""Our discussion above highlights the key role that tech has been playing in recent times, not just in the markets but also in terms of contributing to the growth of other sectors. Tech's contributions till date have resulted in many financial professionals beginning to consider it as a defensive sector as well, making stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) good options for those looking to buy into some of the best beginner stocks.

Demand for electricity is growing and notably, load peaks are changing as well.

Vistra is well positioned with diversified fuel sources including solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and battery power storage facilities, along with a marketing division to manage price volatility. The company will soon be closing its accretive acquisition of merchant power generator, Energy Harbor, and the deal will make Vistra the second largest carbon free, nuclear electricity provider behind Constellation Energy, another portfolio holding.

They have also been an important voice to advocate for changes that will accelerate the global transition to a clean, renewable energy future, while maintaining adequate near-term supply. Vistra has a strong balance sheet that allows the company to invest in innovation and operational improvements. Additionally, management is using excess cash flow to buy 40% of the outstanding shares over a five year period and they are more than half way through that process. Currently valued at 9 times earnings with a 17% free cash flow yield and a 2.3% dividend, the stock remains a full position.

ScotRail, a nationalized entity of the Scottish Government, earlier pledged to invest 1.6 million euros to triple the number of body-worn cameras across its rail network. The campaign, launched in December 2023 in partnership with British Transport Police, aims to combat anti-social behavior and protect its staff on duty.The VB400 body-worn cameras are known for their durability and are designed to capture high-quality video from the wearer’s viewpoint with an intuitive recording function. Along with long battery life for full shift recording, its pre- and post-incident records document the vital context of incidents. Staff might not have a chance to initiate recording on time during rapidly escalating events. In those cases, the solution can capture 30 seconds of pre and post footage from the point at which the camera is activated.In addition to that, the peer-assisted recording function captures the incident from multiple viewpoints. Videos are stored and organized with time, date and location details. Its encryption feature ensures the integrity of the video evidence. Additionally, the integrated GPS system effectively tracks team members, ensuring better coordination and situational awareness.With this initiative, ScotRail’s management is prioritizing the safety of its passengers and employees. The company has already witnessed notable improvements in terms of decreasing reported incidents and increased staff morale and confidence. Motorola’s Body Worn cameras will serve as valuable tools for de-escalating situations and foster positive interaction among staff and passengers.The use of body-worn cameras improves transparency and accountability, which can enhance trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. The solution is increasingly being deployed across the globe to boost the security of police officers. This year, Motorola has already secured a contract for 4,000 VB400 cameras from the Austrian Government.Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products, and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. The communications equipment maker intends to boost its position in the public safety domain by entering into strategic alliances with other players in the ecosystem.

However, its valuation doesn't fully reflect its underlying business strength, with shares trading at only 7.8 times forward earnings."", ""Alibaba's growth has slowed considerably, largely due to the sluggish Chinese economy.

The firm's official research implies the coin could deliver a gain of 2,000% by 2030, but Wood herself just came out with a new price target that points to a potential upside of more than 5,300%."", ""Bitcoin is trading near an all-time high right now and investors are as enthusiastic about its prospects as ever, but is Wood's forecast realistic?"", ""Bitcoin is often discussed as a replacement for traditional money. It isn't governed by any person or institution, and the blockchain upon which it is built is an accurate and transparent system of record. But its price is incredibly volatile; Bitcoin lost 65% of its value in 2022 and it has since gained about 325% from its low point that year. As a result, it's too unpredictable to become a means of exchange for most consumers and businesses."", 'Many investors instead consider Bitcoin a store of value -- like a digital version of gold -- and it has outperformed every other major asset class during the past five years:', 'The investment thesis behind Bitcoin is relatively simple. Supply is limited to 21 million coins, which are paid to miners who use powerful computers to add new blocks to the blockchain. A halving is triggered with every 210,000 new blocks, which cuts the reward for mining Bitcoin in half. Estimates suggest the last Bitcoin will be mined sometime around the year 2140.', ""Since supply is capped, demand alone drives the price. There are nearly 50 million wallets which hold entire bitcoins or partial coins. That figure is near an all-time high. Plus, 2023 was one of the most active years for wallet creation, which is a good indicator of demand. Theoretically, Bitcoin's limited supply will ensure prices move higher for as long as people continue opening new wallets to buy the cryptocurrency."", 'However, that alone might not be enough for Bitcoin to deliver the astronomical gains touted by Ark and Wood.', 'Ark highlights eight potential sources of demand for Bitcoin that could send its price soaring by 2030:', 'Corporate treasury: Ark believes companies will eventually hold between 0% (bear case) and 5% (bull case) of their cash reserves in Bitcoin.', 'Remittance asset: Bitcoin could represent between 5% and 25% of all non-commercial money transfers.', 'Nation state treasury: Government treasury departments around the world could hold between 0% and 5% of their assets in Bitcoin.', 'Emerging market currency: Bitcoin could be the primary currency in some developing nations. El Salvador already adopted it as legal tender.', 'Economic settlement network: Bitcoin could eliminate a number of fees imposed by banks and financial institutions, capturing between 1% and 10% of U.S. bank settlement volume.', 'Seizure-resistant asset: Between 1% and 5% of the global wealth held by high net worth individuals could be stored in Bitcoin to protect it from the government.', 'Institutional investment: Banks and financial institutions could place between 1% and 6.5% of their assets in Bitcoin because they believe it will further appreciate in value.', 'Digital gold: Between 20% and 50% of the money investors normally allocate to gold could eventually be placed in Bitcoin instead, thanks to its strong performance and portability.', ""Here's how high Ark believes Bitcoin can rise by 2030 based on the demand generated by those eight catalysts:"", ""Bear case: $258,500, representing an upside of about 270% from today's price of roughly $69,000."", 'Base case: $682,800, representing an upside of 880%.', 'Bull case: $1,480,000, representing an upside of 2,400%.', ""Wood spoke at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York last week, where she said Bitcoin could actually eclipse Ark's 2030 price target of $1.48 million and instead soar to $3.8 million. The 5,300% upside could be driven by further adoption of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which won the approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January."", 'So far, the 10 approved ETF operators -- including Ark -- manage more than $58 billion worth of assets in their Bitcoin funds, and that figure is growing. Wood says if institutional investors allocated a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that alone would be enough to warrant a price of $3.8 million.', 'Wood thinks Bitcoin still has miles to go in terms of upside. She believes the cryptocurrency is key to an internet-based means of transacting that eliminates toll takers like banks and financial institutions, which collect a fee almost every time money moves.', ""Past performance doesn't predict future results, so there is no guarantee Bitcoin will continue to outperform other asset classes, let alone surge more than 50-fold."", 'The cryptocurrency would have a market capitalization of $74.7 trillion if it did reach a price of $3.8 million, making it nearly three times more valuable than the U.S. economy by gross domestic product, and 23 times more valuable than the largest company in the world (Microsoft).', ""To me, that seems unlikely. Treating Bitcoin as a store of value does make sense, and perhaps one day it could have a similar market cap to gold, which currently stands at $14.6 trillion. That would translate to a 10-fold return in Bitcoin from here, taking it to $743,500, which is slightly above Ark's base-case estimate."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World.', 'As reported by the United Nations, homelessness is the deprivation of stable, safe, and adequate housing without being able to obtain it. The concept extends from a lack of physical shelter to social exclusion. Homeless groups include people living in open spaces, streets, temporary emergency accommodations, shelters, camps, as well as informal settlements.', 'The World Economic Forum reports that approximately 150 million people were homeless around the world in 2021. This equates to 2% of the global population without considering the fact that this doesn’t represent real statistics since measuring homelessness is daunting. The global pandemic worsened the state of homelessness worldwide. This was when economies struggled against the lasting impacts of lockdowns and soaring poverty. In this regard, countries have been fighting their battles against homelessness. While modular mini-homes were provided to the homeless in the UK, shipping containers were used to make an apartment complex for the homeless residing in downtown Los Angeles.', 'The United Nations has referred to homelessness as a harmful form of systemic discrimination that impacts people in both developed and developing countries. Previously, we have also discussed the countries with the highest homeless population. Representing developing countries and China, Guyana’s representative exclaimed that homelessness has experienced a rise over the years. In African nations such as Angola, rural poverty primarily drives homelessness. Apart from social inequality and poverty, climate change serves as another cause of homelessness. Small island developing states have been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and storms which massively destroy the social infrastructure while displacing many. Temporary housing and relocation assistance become crucial ways to address disaster-related displacement.', 'On the contrary, the developed United States also continues to find ways to tackle the homeless crisis in the country. On March 22, Reuters reported that more than 653,000 people in America were homeless in 2023, recording a 12% year-over-year increase since 2022. Diverse strategies are being proposed to combat this homelessness. While legislation related to banning people from camping on city sidewalks, parks, and public places was signed in Florida, more than $20 billion has been spent on housing and homelessness programs in California since 2018. Policy experts are of the opinion that access to affordable housing is a better solution rather than clearances that cannot function for a long time. In conclusion, the opposition between a crackdown on camping and raising funding to accommodate the homeless continues across the nation. You can also view the states with the highest homeless population and the cities with the largest homeless populations in the US to have a better understanding of homelessness in the country.', 'Building upon the rising crisis of homelessness penetrating America, local companies continue to address the issue. American companies engaging in the nation’s battle against homelessness include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).', 'The e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) caters to housing affordability and accessibility issues, especially for the deprived. The company’s Housing Equity Fund offers more than $2 billion in below-market loans and grants for 20,000 affordable homes for low-to-middle-income families in the local communities. In collaboration with minority-led organizations, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested more than $760 million in the creation and preservation of 4,500 affordable homes. Partnerships with public transit agencies have also been undertaken to introduce cheap housing near high-capacity public transit areas.', 'Another company ensuring affordability for housing is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company unveiled its Affordable Housing Initiative back in 2019 under which it aimed to fix the shortage of housing and the resulting high prices in Puget Sound region. The region also hosts many people living unsheltered. The company granted $1.5 million in an effort to reduce homelessness across King County. \xa0The firm also supports organizations involved in providing permanent shelter to the homeless and essential services to get people back on their feet. Extending its initiative, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested $583 million to create and preserve 9,200 housing units in the Puget Sound region.', 'Homelessness in California was catered to by the leading tech company Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company has committed $2.5 billion to improve the housing crisis across California. The task of constructing affordable housing for the unhoused or those who face the risk of losing their house is being undertaken by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with its community partners. The company is working towards the construction of new homes for 20,000 individuals and another 24,000 to help them stay housed while they are subject to the danger of becoming homeless. It has also helped the nonprofit Home expand its Homelessness Prevention System which provides direct financial assistance.', 'Now that we have taken a look at global homelessness and the ongoing fight against it, let’s move to the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world.', '20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World', 'Our Methodology:', 'In order to compile a list of the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world, we sourced the most recent data on homelessness from the OECD.

Cheaper homes along with the Housing First strategy is targeting homelessness in Austria. The country has planned to offer numerous homeless people their own flats.', 'Homeless Population (2009): 21,216', 'Greece is another country with low homelessness.

However, the country is home to numerous asylum seekers who face homelessness.', 'Homeless Population (2019): 14,013', 'Among other countries, homeless individuals tend to be less in Chile. The country’s extreme winter weather ends up leaving many homeless. The capital city of Santiago hosts many of the homeless people in Chile.', 'Homeless Population (2019): 13,252', 'Colombia ranks among the 20 countries which have low homelessness. The World Bank has also invested in programs directed to improve housing and support for vulnerable neighborhoods in Colombia in the past. These vulnerable communities are deprived of access to safe and decent housing.', 'Homeless Population (2014): 10,068', 'Hungary is another country with low statistics for homelessness. While a portion of the homeless population resorts to emergency shelters, temporary homes, and street outreach services, many tend to sleep rough. Mental health issues, irregular incomes, and addictions are common problems among the homeless sleeping rough in the country.', 'Homeless Population (2019): 7,107', 'Although the homeless population is relatively lower in Portugal, it has been increasing. People residing in mere tents in Lisbon have risen. Increase in drug consumption and immigration are also issues contributing to homelessness in the country.', 'Homeless Population (2017): 6,877', 'One of the lowest homeless populations globally resides in Latvia.

However, Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) has also been able to draw in female consumers through its marketing efforts, offering flavors such as Peach Vibe and Watermelon and a formula designed to boost the human body's metabolism. As a result, the company's customers are evenly split between males and females."", 'Why should this matter to investors? Because Celsius has been able to drive a whole new category of consumers to its energy drinks, which, in turn, is driving market share gains and exceptional revenue growth.', ""Let's check out why Celsius looks set to energize your portfolio."", ""Celsius' soaring popularity led the company to strike a distribution deal with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) in 2022, in which the soda and snack juggernaut also took an 8.5% stake in the energy drink maker. This was a transformative deal for Celsius, as PepsiCo took over its distribution in the U.S., helping to put Celsius' products into more stores."", ""While energy drinks are sold through grocery stores and mass merchant retailers, the convenience store channel is the biggest outlet for these products. Convenience stores tend to be more regional or local in nature, and with over 150,000 convenience stores in the U.S., getting into all these stores isn't easy. However, with PepsiCo having a huge presence in the channel with its soda and snack offerings, it has been able to get Celsius into most of these stores."", ""This is important because it puts Celsius energy drinks in front of consumers. Energy drinks are often spur-of-the-moment purchases, so if a consumer goes into a convenience store and doesn't find Celsius, there is a high likelihood they'll buy something else instead."", ""In the beverage industry, distribution is often measured by the percentage of all commodity volumes (ACV). This metric gives a sense of how well a product is being distributed in each particular market. The calculation is weighted by a retailer's sales, so a store selling $1 million a year in energy drinks is counted much more heavily than a store with only $1,000 in annual energy drink sales. At the end of 2023, Celsius' U.S. ACV was 98%, up from 44% in the convenience store channel at the end of 2021. This means that nearly every store that sells energy drinks now also carries Celsius."", ""In addition to helping Celsius get into more stores, the combination of a popular product and PepsiCo's distribution also allows the company to get additional cooler space as it introduces new products and flavors. The more products on the shelves, the more energy drinks the company can sell."", ""Given the company's success in the U.S., it is now starting to enter international markets as well. In January, it expanded its deal with PepsiCo for distribution into Canada. Meanwhile, it recently selected Suntory Beverage to be its distribution partner in the U.K., Ireland, and Northern Ireland, and Suntory Oceania to be its distribution partner in Australia and New Zealand."", ""In 2023, nearly 96% of Celsius' revenue came from North America. By comparison, 62% of Monster's 2023 revenue came from the U.S. This demonstrates the long runway of international growth that the company could have ahead of it."", ""Celsius' stock isn't necessarily cheap, trading at over 84 times forward P/E and a nearly 2 times PEG ratio. It does face competition from established players like Monster and Red Bull, along with upstarts like the female-focused Alani NU. So, there are risks."", 'However, while Celsius saw its revenue more than double last year to $1.3 billion, that is still small compared to the $7.1 billion in revenue that Monster generated in 2023.', 'With shelf space gains, new product and flavor introductions, and international expansion ahead, Celsius has a long growth runway.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the\xa0Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In Now.', 'Investing in defensive sectors has always been a go-to strategy for investors who like to play it safe, which is why many new investors in particular are heavily drawn to these areas in the market. Traditionally, the main defensive sectors in the market are healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Over the past year, some financial professionals saw a trend of most investors avoiding defensive stocks, but this may come to an end in 2024, as John Mowrey, NFJ Investment Group\'s executive managing director and CIO, noted on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on January 30:', '""You\'ve been paid to avoid some of the more defensive areas because of higher interest rates. So if you look at utilities, if you look at staples, if you look at healthcare, all of these higher-yielding areas have been hollowed out because you\'ve been paid to avoid them. Everyone\'s been chasing the Mag 7 and the AI trend and then they\'re clipping coupons in fixed income. That\'s created a real opportunity in the more defensive areas. So should you get a bumpier period in the market, I think you\'ll get paid to be in those areas. So I like some of the more defensive areas.""', 'Mowrey believes that investors would be well-served to start moving into defensive areas as they are offering more attractive valuations, healthy dividends, and dividend growth, the last of which is a strong barrier against inflation. Considering these factors, many believe that defensive stocks are among the best beginner stocks to buy at present.', 'Considering the above, major fund managers are gravitating towards defensive investments. For instance, on February 21, Thomas Taw, the BlackRock APAC iShares Investment Strategy Head, joined ""Bloomberg Markets: Asia"" to discuss his recent moves. Taw noted that he is now positioning ""more defensively in equity portfolios"" instead of pursuing higher valuation companies and that he is particularly looking into more ""dividend type of investing.""', ""Investments in defensive sectors have been driving growth exponentially. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s healthcare sector outlook report for 2024 noted that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic propelled venture capitalists and investors to provide financial backing to the healthcare sector, resulting in investments in healthcare startups reaching all-time highs in 2021. The focus on tech in healthcare has also resulted in investors committing significant capital to medical technologies. Additionally, Deloitte's 2024 outlook on the utilities sector noted that the US Inflation Reduction Act's one-year anniversary marked the moment when investments worth at least $122 billion in clean-energy generation projects were confirmed.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) has surprised everyone by coming up high. On January 23, 2024, the company reported its statistics for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. According to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), it received 13.1 million subscribers during this period, the largest-ever number for Q4. This brought the total number of subscribers to 260 million. Netflix, Inc.

Thursday Night Football (TNF) grew the total viewership for its second season by a 24% year-on-year growth.

The company also grew its sports-related offerings by adding several sports documentaries and new broadcast rights for various sports leagues, such as the National Women’s Soccer League.

Obviously, there is a lot of optimism right now as far as these two names are concerned. Both for, I think, slightly different reasons.', 'So I think as far as Netflix is concerned, I think, the market generally sees a lot more momentum when it comes to adding subscribers. We know they have those two new initiatives in place. One is, of course, paid sharing, which is the password sharing kind of crackdown. And then you have the advertising tier.', ""And we did see them as a result of those ad, almost 30 million subscribers in 2023. Obviously, it's not probably going to be that high this year. But still, I mean, consensus expects 20, maybe even upwards of 22, 23 million new subscribers this year."", ""And, then for Disney it's not so much subscriber growth itself, but rather moderating streaming losses and actually hitting profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. So for both these companies, there is obviously a lot of excitement, I think, that there definitely is room to run."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Jamie, let's bring you in here and get your take as well. What do you say, Jamie, to those who argue, streaming wars, it's already over. Netflix one. What's your response to that?"", ""JAMIE LUMLEY: Well, I think it's important to understand that although Netflix is clearly in a very strong position, there still a lot of optimism around different other players within the streaming space looking at Disney. There is the potential that it can finally start to fully cut down on streaming losses."", ""And then also take on new initiatives like the streaming sports venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery. I think a lot of people were surprised to see that there's now going to potentially be a new way to monetize sports content, which continues to be one of the most valuable assets in the space. On top of that as well, thinking with Disney, there is the upcoming launch of ESPN as a flagship streaming app. This could definitely bring more viewers into the fold and facilitate that transition from a legacy linear media business to a much more digital first direct to consumer business."", ""So although there are definitely a lot of people just looking at Netflix, the margins that they've been able to achieve and really the strong 2023 that they had, it's not over for the other players in the media space.""]"

They're trickling that in because it's adding, you know, a nice buffer for new subscriber additions for those who get kicked off and also for families who choose the extra member feature, and that's a nice boost to ARPPU."", ""So I think we'll continue to see that just in, you know, diminishing rate that we saw in 2023. There's also the ad tier. The ad tier is nearing accretion so that incremental ARPPU that you get from the ad tier, it's-- you know, it hasn't, you know, added anything to ARPPU yet. It's reaching parity. I think it will-- In the back half, it'll start becoming accretive, and then in 2025, it'll be more meaningfully accretive, and that can grow pretty substantially beyond 2025. So it's still a really interesting story here, and there's quite a bit of growth in all aspects.

So the ad tier accretion, that drives revenue, that drives earnings, that drives free cash flow. So that's a hugely positive story. You know, consensus is calling for a doubling of EPS from 23 to 25, or 26. And we think that's absolutely reasonable. A lot of that is just coming from, you know, the extra member feature being entirely incremental revenue, and then, you know, the accretion from the ad tier being entirely incremental revenue and at a very high margin."", ""You know, they're not spending, you know, terribly much on that.

So this one\'s interesting, Patrick, unleaded gasoline I was reading 3.54 a gallon on average across the country on Wednesday. ""The Journal"" was pointing out it\'s up 3% from a year ago, Patrick, 14% than at the start of the year. What is driving this exactly?', ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, this is all seasonal, very expected. Three main reasons though from the seasonality boosting prices refinery maintenance happens at this time of year, almost every year. Refinery maintenance then also limits how much refineries can produce. That's happening at the same time that much of the nation, in fact, all the nation is switching to cheaper-- or excuse me, more expensive summer gasoline from cheaper winter gasoline, which has more butane. And demand is also going up."", 'Americans are getting out more, the eclipse is a week away, but spring break travels also happening. All three of those demand refinery maintenance and the transition to summer gasoline is all boosting prices, and it probably will continue another couple of weeks yet before we plateau.', ""- How far are we going to go then? We're talking $4 a barrel?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, I don't think we'll quite get to $4. Yeah, maybe 3.60 to 3.90 a gallon, somewhere there. I mean, oil prices have been rising in the background too. That's something that we'll have to keep an eye on here over the next couple of months."", ""OPEC maintaining a very delicate balance of production driving oil up to $82 to $83 a barrel. But I think we're going to stop short for now. There could be a caveat or hurricane, an additional geopolitical strife that we may have to concern with that could eventually push prices to $4. But I think that's going to be the exception if it does happen this summer, not the norm."", '- Any kind of upside risk to that call though, Patrick?', 'PATRICK DE HAAN: Oh, certainly without a doubt. As I mentioned, some of those caveats, some of the unknowns, certainly OPEC as well. Now, if the Fed does start to cut interest rates, that could start to heat the economy back up, it could push demand up.', ""There is a case that if the Fed starts cutting interest rates, depending on how consumers react to that, we could see growth and demand push gas prices a little bit closer to that $4 a gallon mark, or a major hurricane that could happen in August or September, and anything undeveloped, especially in Russia's invasion of Ukraine."", ""Now Ukraine's been fighting back, attacking Russian refineries. And there's only a finite amount of global refining capacity. So if that continues, that could also push the argument a $4 a gallon gas more towards reality."", ""- Patrick, you've listed a number of seasonal factors. There's geopolitical factors, but of course every time gas goes up, the Biden administration is watching this one closely, especially in an election year. If we get closer to that $4 a gallon level or if we pass that, is there a possibility of tapping into the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserves? In what's the capacity of that right now, just given how depleted it already is?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, the SPR is back north of half full. We're at about 363 million barrels, the SPR has gone up virtually every week for the last few months. I really think the Biden administration is not going to tap it, unless there's a massive spike in the price of oil."", ""Again, it is a Strategic Reserve, there's a strong argument that it was utilized last time, Russia's invasion of Ukraine causing oil to jump to 130, it was used then. But I think they're going to resist the temptation to use the SPR, knowing that it's not just the SPR that will have to lower prices, but it's also refineries turning that oil into gasoline, that's the wild card refineries."", ""Don't necessarily have to churn out gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, so it could depress prices. But again, I don't think the administration is going to use that, simply because they've been so focused on increasing the SPR ahead of the election. Either way, there's going to be politicians on both sides of the aisle that are going to start pointing fingers one way or another."", ""- And Patrick, I'm interested. We always talk about gas prices nationally, I'm also always interested to get your take on what's going on, just kind of regionally, Patrick, any stark differences there-- east, south, west?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, absolutely. The west often gets roasted when filling up. California's back above $5 a gallon. They have a very unique setup though in California. They're cut off from really a lot of the rest of the nation. They have a declining number of refineries that is tasked with keeping up with demand."", 'And keep in mind, they have their own blend of gasoline mandated by the Air Resources Board, which is the only state that can supersede EPA. So they have all these rules, high taxes carbon programs like cap and trade.', ""California's always among the highest. In fact, much of the West Coast also is above average, simply because they don't have the pipelines to connect each other, all these regions to the refineries that would be necessary. So the West Coast always takes the cake with the highest gas prices.""]"

Most utilities tend to be slower-growing companies known more for paying higher-yielding dividends. As a result, many struggle to beat the S&P 500. However, while NextEra does pay an above-average dividend (currently yielding 3.4% compared to the S&P 500's 1.3%), it has a proven ability to deliver market-beating total returns. Over the last decade, the utility has produced a 13.1% average annualized total return, outpacing the S&P 500's 12.9% total return. "", ""NextEra should have the power to continue outperforming the S&P 500 in the future. Here's why."", 'Like most utilities, NextEra Energy generates lots of stable cash flow. In 2023, it produced $11.3 billion in net cash provided by operating activities. It used $3.7 billion of that cash to pay dividends to shareholders. That gave the company a relatively low dividend payout ratio (59% of its adjusted earnings, well below the peer group average of 65%). ', 'NextEra Energy retained the rest of its steady cash flow to help fund new investments to grow its electric utility in Florida (FPL) and Energy Resources platform. It invested $9.4 billion at FPL, including placing 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of cost-effective solar projects into service and starting up a 25-megawatt hydrogen pilot project at its Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. Meanwhile, it invested roughly $15.7 billion to expand the Energy Resources business, primarily to build new renewable energy capacity. The company funded the shortfall with asset sales and its strong balance sheet. ', ""These investments helped lift its adjusted earnings by 9.3% per share last year. That earnings expansion supported a 10% increase in the company's dividend. NextEra Energy has boosted its adjusted earnings at a 10% compound annual rate over the last decade while delivering 11% compound annual dividend growth. That rapid earnings and dividend growth have helped power its market-beating returns. "", ""NextEra Energy Partners expects to use its strong cash flow to continue increasing its dividend and invest in expanding its infrastructure. It's investing $85 billion to $95 billion through 2025 in infrastructure projects. FPL expects to add 4.8 GW of solar capacity over the next few years. Meanwhile, its Energy Resources segment has secured over 20 GW of wind, solar, and energy storage projects. It's also investing money to modernize FPL and build energy transmission lines in Energy Resources. "", ""These investments should boost its earnings by 6% to 8% annually through at least 2026, with the expectation that growth will be toward the upper end of that range. Operating cash flow should expand at or above the top end of that range. That should give NextEra Energy the power to increase its dividend by 10% annually through at least 2026. Add in its higher-yielding dividend, and the company's rising earnings should give it the fuel to produce total returns of at least 9% to 11% annually over the next few years. "", ""Meanwhile, its longer-term growth outlook remains equally compelling. According to multiple forecasts, renewable energy demand in the U.S. will grow at a 13% compound annual rate through 2030. That suggests the country will build more capacity over the next several years (375 GW-450 GW) than it did over the past three decades (235 GW). Given the massive amount of renewable energy capacity needed to decarbonize the U.S. economy, there's still plenty of growth potential beyond that time frame. As a leader in the industry, NextEra should keep capturing opportunities to invest in the sector. That should enable it to expand its earnings at an above-average rate, supporting continued dividend growth. "", ""NextEra Energy's utility and renewable energy operations generate lots of cash, which it uses to pay dividends and invest in expanding its businesses. Those growth-related investments should increase its cash flow in the future, giving it more money to pay dividends. That growing earnings and income should give it the power to continue producing market-beating total returns.

In fact, rising interest rates have resulted in Wall Street shunning utility stocks. While there are some good reasons for that, it has opened up an opportunity for long-term income investors to buy reliable dividend stocks like NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK), and Black Hills Corporation (NYSE: BKH). Here's a look at each of these energy specialists."", ""There's no way to hide the fact that utility stocks are in the dumps today. As the chart below clearly shows, the utility sector, using Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as a proxy, has been heading lower while the S&P 500 index has been moving higher. What's been going on? The big issue is that interest rates have been on the rise. That poses two problems for utility stocks."", 'First, other income options, like certificates of deposit (CDs), are more competitive with some stocks, like utilities, that are known for producing income. If you can get a 5% or so yield from a super-safe CD, why take on the risk of owning a similarly yielding stock? The opportunity for dividend growth is one (very good) reason, but sometimes investors are too short-term focused. As a result, money has shifted out of the utility sector.', 'Second, and probably more important to consider, is that utilities tend to be capital-intensive companies. That means debt is often a key part of the capital structure. Rising interest rates simply make it more expensive to do business. This will probably hurt near-term financial results throughout the sector. It makes some sense that investors are worried about that. However, these are largely regulated businesses. That means that the government has to approve capital spending plans and rate structures, balancing the need for profit against cost and reliability for customers. Higher rates will, eventually, be taken into consideration in that equation. So, over the long term, slow-and-steady growth is still the likely outcome.', 'In the end, then, the current industry malaise is probably a long-term opportunity for dividend investors.', 'NextEra Energy is going to be most attractive to dividend growth investors. Although it owns one of the largest regulated utility operations in the United States (Florida Power & Light), about 30% of its business is dedicated to a rapidly expanding renewable power business. That combination has resulted in annual dividend growth of around 10% on average over the past decade. Management currently believes it can increase the dividend at around that same rate through at least 2026.', ""That's a pretty astounding pace of dividend growth in the utility sector, which explains why NextEra Energy has long been afforded a premium valuation. But thanks to the current industry downturn, the yield is near a 10-year high at about 3.3%. While that's below the 3.5% industry average, it is still a great opportunity for dividend growth investors; the dividend has been raised annually for 29 consecutive years."", ""Duke Energy is a bit more conventional. While it is also one of the largest utility companies in the United States, it doesn't have a fast-growing clean energy business like NextEra Energy does. In fact, Duke recently agreed to sell the non-regulated clean energy business it did own. Effectively, it is doubling down on regulated assets, which will increasingly require clean energy investments to be made. But making those investments within the regulated framework will provide more consistent returns. The company has increased its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years and the dividend yield is toward the high end its range over the past decade at 4.3%. Note that the yield is notably above the industry average."", ""The last utility up is tiny Black Hills Corporation, which has a yield of just about 5%. Like the other two utilities here, that's toward the high end of the range over the past decade. Before moving on to the big reason to like Black Hills, it is worth highlighting just how small it is. This utility's market cap is $3.5 billion, which compares to $72 billion for Duke and a whopping $126 billion for NextEra. That's why it is all the more impressive to see that, of the three, Black Hills is the only one that happens to be a Dividend King, with 55 years' worth of annual dividend increases behind it. It is something of a hidden gem in the utility sector. Like Duke, it is a simple regulated utility, but if you appreciate dividend consistency, it wins hands-down."", ""Wall Street is particularly downbeat on the utility sector today and that is creating long-term opportunity for dividend investors. You just have to be willing to go against the grain and buy when others are selling. However, if you take the time, you'll find that there are a lot of options in the sector, including dividend-growth stocks like NextEra, boring and reliable giants like Duke, and even Dividend Kings like Black Hills. If you like dividends, don't let this utility sell-off pass you buy without at least doing a deep dive into the space."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

Traditionally, the main defensive sectors in the market are healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Over the past year, some financial professionals saw a trend of most investors avoiding defensive stocks, but this may come to an end in 2024, as John Mowrey, NFJ Investment Group\'s executive managing director and CIO, noted on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on January 30:', '""You\'ve been paid to avoid some of the more defensive areas because of higher interest rates. So if you look at utilities, if you look at staples, if you look at healthcare, all of these higher-yielding areas have been hollowed out because you\'ve been paid to avoid them. Everyone\'s been chasing the Mag 7 and the AI trend and then they\'re clipping coupons in fixed income. That\'s created a real opportunity in the more defensive areas. So should you get a bumpier period in the market, I think you\'ll get paid to be in those areas. So I like some of the more defensive areas.""', 'Mowrey believes that investors would be well-served to start moving into defensive areas as they are offering more attractive valuations, healthy dividends, and dividend growth, the last of which is a strong barrier against inflation. Considering these factors, many believe that defensive stocks are among the best beginner stocks to buy at present.', 'Considering the above, major fund managers are gravitating towards defensive investments. For instance, on February 21, Thomas Taw, the BlackRock APAC iShares Investment Strategy Head, joined ""Bloomberg Markets: Asia"" to discuss his recent moves. Taw noted that he is now positioning ""more defensively in equity portfolios"" instead of pursuing higher valuation companies and that he is particularly looking into more ""dividend type of investing.""', ""Investments in defensive sectors have been driving growth exponentially. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s healthcare sector outlook report for 2024 noted that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic propelled venture capitalists and investors to provide financial backing to the healthcare sector, resulting in investments in healthcare startups reaching all-time highs in 2021. The focus on tech in healthcare has also resulted in investors committing significant capital to medical technologies. Additionally, Deloitte's 2024 outlook on the utilities sector noted that the US Inflation Reduction Act's one-year anniversary marked the moment when investments worth at least $122 billion in clean-energy generation projects were confirmed. Like healthcare, the utilities sector is also increasingly turning to technology in its operations and goals for electrification, with Deloitte stating that 2024 will see power and utilities companies turning to artificial intelligence and other digital solutions as they work to transform the grid."", ""Our discussion above highlights the key role that tech has been playing in recent times, not just in the markets but also in terms of contributing to the growth of other sectors. Tech's contributions till date have resulted in many financial professionals beginning to consider it as a defensive sector as well, making stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

GasBuddy Head of Petroleum Analysis Patrick De Haan joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the upward trends in gas and oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F).', '""Americans are getting out more: the [solar] eclipse is a week away, but spring break travel is also happening. All three of those — demand, refinery maintenance, and the transition to summer gasoline — is all boosting prices, and it probably will continue another couple weeks yet before we plateau,"" De Haan says.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""- We've seen sharp rises in the cost of fuel overtaking oil and an unusual move in the market, drivers are forking out more than a quarter more now for a gallon of gas than they did a month ago, with some analysts saying, we could see gallon at $4 by May. For his view, let's bring in Patrick De Haan, Gasbuddy's head of petroleum analysis."", 'Patrick, it is always good to have you on the program. So this one\'s interesting, Patrick, unleaded gasoline I was reading 3.54 a gallon on average across the country on Wednesday. ""The Journal"" was pointing out it\'s up 3% from a year ago, Patrick, 14% than at the start of the year. What is driving this exactly?', ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, this is all seasonal, very expected. Three main reasons though from the seasonality boosting prices refinery maintenance happens at this time of year, almost every year. Refinery maintenance then also limits how much refineries can produce. That's happening at the same time that much of the nation, in fact, all the nation is switching to cheaper-- or excuse me, more expensive summer gasoline from cheaper winter gasoline, which has more butane. And demand is also going up."", 'Americans are getting out more, the eclipse is a week away, but spring break travels also happening. All three of those demand refinery maintenance and the transition to summer gasoline is all boosting prices, and it probably will continue another couple of weeks yet before we plateau.', ""- How far are we going to go then? We're talking $4 a barrel?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, I don't think we'll quite get to $4. Yeah, maybe 3.60 to 3.90 a gallon, somewhere there. I mean, oil prices have been rising in the background too. That's something that we'll have to keep an eye on here over the next couple of months."", ""OPEC maintaining a very delicate balance of production driving oil up to $82 to $83 a barrel. But I think we're going to stop short for now. There could be a caveat or hurricane, an additional geopolitical strife that we may have to concern with that could eventually push prices to $4. But I think that's going to be the exception if it does happen this summer, not the norm."", '- Any kind of upside risk to that call though, Patrick?', 'PATRICK DE HAAN: Oh, certainly without a doubt. As I mentioned, some of those caveats, some of the unknowns, certainly OPEC as well. Now, if the Fed does start to cut interest rates, that could start to heat the economy back up, it could push demand up.', ""There is a case that if the Fed starts cutting interest rates, depending on how consumers react to that, we could see growth and demand push gas prices a little bit closer to that $4 a gallon mark, or a major hurricane that could happen in August or September, and anything undeveloped, especially in Russia's invasion of Ukraine."", ""Now Ukraine's been fighting back, attacking Russian refineries. And there's only a finite amount of global refining capacity. So if that continues, that could also push the argument a $4 a gallon gas more towards reality."", ""- Patrick, you've listed a number of seasonal factors. There's geopolitical factors, but of course every time gas goes up, the Biden administration is watching this one closely, especially in an election year. If we get closer to that $4 a gallon level or if we pass that, is there a possibility of tapping into the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserves? In what's the capacity of that right now, just given how depleted it already is?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, the SPR is back north of half full. We're at about 363 million barrels, the SPR has gone up virtually every week for the last few months. I really think the Biden administration is not going to tap it, unless there's a massive spike in the price of oil."", ""Again, it is a Strategic Reserve, there's a strong argument that it was utilized last time, Russia's invasion of Ukraine causing oil to jump to 130, it was used then. But I think they're going to resist the temptation to use the SPR, knowing that it's not just the SPR that will have to lower prices, but it's also refineries turning that oil into gasoline, that's the wild card refineries."", ""Don't necessarily have to churn out gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, so it could depress prices. But again, I don't think the administration is going to use that, simply because they've been so focused on increasing the SPR ahead of the election. Either way, there's going to be politicians on both sides of the aisle that are going to start pointing fingers one way or another."", ""- And Patrick, I'm interested. We always talk about gas prices nationally, I'm also always interested to get your take on what's going on, just kind of regionally, Patrick, any stark differences there-- east, south, west?"", ""PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, absolutely. The west often gets roasted when filling up. California's back above $5 a gallon. They have a very unique setup though in California. They're cut off from really a lot of the rest of the nation. They have a declining number of refineries that is tasked with keeping up with demand."", 'And keep in mind, they have their own blend of gasoline mandated by the Air Resources Board, which is the only state that can supersede EPA. So they have all these rules, high taxes carbon programs like cap and trade.', ""California's always among the highest. In fact, much of the West Coast also is above average, simply because they don't have the pipelines to connect each other, all these regions to the refineries that would be necessary. So the West Coast always takes the cake with the highest gas prices.""]"

Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)."", 'Now, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.', ""So naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro."", ""Yet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public.

It’s too complex and subjective a job for any AI model, they said. Fast forward a few months, more and more investment experts and firms are deploying AI for stock picking. Bloomberg in February reported that Vanguard Group was using AI in several of its products that use quant investing techniques. Among the funds where Vanguard has deployed machine learning models include the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund, the Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. The Bloomberg report said that the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund and the Strategic Small-Cap Fund beat their benchmarks and outperformed industry peers last year.', 'Machine learning and algorithms have long been at play in the investing game for quant funds. But the generative AI boom is making the power of mathematical, AI-powered analysis available for everyone. Using AI in investing would no longer be limited to quant funds. Financial services company Mercer conducted a survey to find out the penetration of AI among investment managers across its Global Investment Manager Database. Nine out of 10 surveyed managers said they are already using or planning to use AI in their investment process. A whopping 54% of the investment managers said they are already using AI to assist their decision making, while 37% plan to use the technology in the near future.', 'Mercer said in its report that the investment managers it surveyed said that the use of AI would give a whopping $14 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.', 'Since generative AI and machine learning in investing is currently in its early stages, there are some challenges for investment managers who are trying to use the technology to their advantage. Data quality and data availability are among the biggest challenges these managers are facing.', 'But robots are not taking over the investing game (for now). Almost no one in the survey said they are completely outsourcing the investing-related decision-making to AI. They are using AI-powered models just for assistance, idea generation, data analysis and other important tasks in the investing process. Final decision-making still rests with humans. The report added:', '“Just a small minority of managers report fully automated statistical, ML and DL models, reinforcing AI and ML technologies as tools that support managers, rather than replacing the role of manager judgment and intervention. Among managers currently using AI, around one in 10 report full automation of statistical models (11%), ML (14%) and DL models (6%), while a third report infrequent monitoring of these processes (33%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Across all three areas, a significant proportion of current AI processes remain reliant on constant human intervention, reinforcing the role of AI and ML technologies as a supportive “tool” rather than a direct replacement of humans across the investment process.”', 'Methodology', 'This article is a performance evaluation of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year.

For that we reverted to our experiment with ChatGPT conducted in March 2023 where we asked ChatGPT to recommend some stocks that would make one rich over the next 10 years.

Even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Johnson & Johnson saw little to no growth in the past five years.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Republic Services' shares before the 1st of April to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.535 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.14 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Republic Services stock has a trailing yield of around 1.1% on the current share price of US$191.44. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Republic Services's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Republic Services has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for Republic Services ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut.

Fortunately, it paid out only 32% of its free cash flow in the past year."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow.

Fortunately for readers, Republic Services's earnings per share have been growing at 12% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Republic Services has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.6% a year on average.

Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our 2023 financial audit is now complete. The 10-K will be filed tomorrow, and I'm pleased to report that our financial results show our strategy to accelerate profitable growth is gaining traction here some highlights. Fourth quarter sales were up 12% sequentially to a record $80 million. That's the fifth consecutive quarter of sales growth. Full year sales were up 42% to a record $286 million. Premium alloy sales also reached record levels, climbing to $21 million in the fourth quarter and jumping 74% for the full year to $68 million or 24% of sales. Gross margin has improved each quarter in 2023, reaching 16.4% in the fourth quarter, the highest level since 2018 despite a $1.6 million raw material misalignment headwind. 16 base price increases over the last three years, including the latest on February 12, continue to benefit sales and gross margin while offsetting negative surcharge misalignment on commodity prices that have been falling, we expect to realize more of these price increase benefits as we move through 2024. Commodities have stabilized over the past few months, which should ease the raw material misalignment by the end of the second quarter, operating income rose 9% sequentially, to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter, despite higher SG&A expense on employee related and insurance costs. Net income reached $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.53 per share for the year, representing a marked turnaround from losses in 2022. Backlog remained strong at $318 million at year end and order entry continues to be healthy. Premium Alloys constitute 36% of our backlog. Our debt was reduced by $13 million in 2023, even with our strategic spend, which is added to new vacuum arc remelt furnaces in North Jackson. We plan to continue to reduce debt in 2024. New VAR furnaces were released into production last month. This new capacity in combination with capacity expansion of our beam furnace will accelerate our premium alloys ramp, which is key to our strategy of accelerating profitable growth. Turning to our end markets, starting with aerospace. Fourth quarter sales rose 15% sequentially to a record $62 million. Full year aerospace sales increased 57% to a record $216 million or 76% of sales. As I said in January, aerospace demand was robust in the fourth quarter and that continues today. The dynamics of that demand remain the same global recovery in air traffic and the demand from airlines for new, more fuel-efficient planes amid capacity constraints due to resilient demand into replacing aging aircraft, huge order backlogs at Airbus and Boeing extending into the next decade, even with Boeing's current challenges since our call on January, Boeing's challenges, which were precipitated by the plug door, blow out on an Alaska Air Max 9 have continued, including investigations by the FAA, NTSB, and Justice Department into the accident and also into Boeing's production procedures. The FAA has kept production of the MAX airplanes at 38 per month, and they've set a 90-day period for the company to develop a plan to address quality control issues. At a conference last week, Boeing CFO, underscored their objective to increase quality and to drive supplier stability. The airlines have been pressing for changes given how critical Boeing is to their fleet expansion plans. Ultimately, though the airlines are holding their slots for Boeing aircraft because their growth plans require it. In fact, Boeing recently described demand is robust, noting new seven three seven orders from American Airlines, a Thai airlines order for 787s and an Ethiopian order for the MAX for the 777X. At the end of February, Boeing's gross backlog of the 737 MAX airplanes totaled 4,752. Wide-body demand has increased with recovery in international travel. Boeing has reached a build rate of five Dreamliners per month and is working towards 10 per month by 2016. Their 787-backlog stood at almost 800 at the end of February. While total backlog was 5,900 planes for nearly nine years of production for Airbus. The main challenge to reaching their build rate goals has been the supply chain. Despite that, Airbus expects the A320 build rate to reach 56 per month in 2024 and recently reported progress well towards their goal of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. Airbus's backlog of A320s at year end totaled nearly 72 hundred aircraft. As to wide bodies. Airbus is working towards a monthly rate of four aircraft for the A330 in 2024 and a rate of 10 in 2026 for the A350. The total year-end backlog at Airbus was 8,600 aircraft. The sustained recovery in air traffic is a major factor driving aircraft demand IATA estimates, global air traffic will grow more than 3% per year over the next 20 years, even with the constraints of infrastructure delays in aircraft delivery and supply chain issues heavy air traffic and the delivery delays of new aircraft are also fueling demand in the MRO market. In the defense sector, worsening world conflicts, increasing threats from Russia, China and North Korea and the step-up in military spend by NATO countries are driving increased market demand on a global basis in the US, the DoD budget for 2020 for prioritizes modernization of the fighter force and air defense benefiting domestic demand for materials. The administration has now proposed an increase to the 2025 defense budget to $895 billion as a major supplier of the premium and specialty alloys required for defense applications. Our participation in that market is growing. We estimate 15% to 20% of our aerospace sales are going to defense. Overall, the aerospace market remains robust, and the supply chain remains in a full pull mode based upon our channel checks, supply chain challenges since COVID have compelled the primes to strengthen and diversify their supplier sources. And we have benefited this has been evident by the pace of our approvals that we are receiving and the new business that we're winning. We expect strong growth in our aerospace sales, including premium alloys to continue as we move through '24 and into '25 and '26. Fourth quarter heavy equipment market sales were $6.4 million, a decrease of 28% from the third quarter, but up 14% year over year. Full year sales increased 15% to $31.2 million or 8% of sales. As we discussed last time, customers grew cautious in the fourth quarter as the outlook for EV sales weakened and we are seeing that near term caution in the first quarter as well. Even so the carmakers are continuing to introduce new models requiring retooling and tool steel. We do expect demand to improve in the second half of the year. General industrial sales increased 68% sequentially to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter. Full year sales of 2023 rose 43% to $15.7 million or 7% of sales. Our general industrial sales are mainly for semiconductor manufacturing. Our latest results show the growing strength of that market. The Semiconductor Industry Association has projected double digit growth for 2024. Given the need for increased chip manufacturing and the move to onshore, we remain very optimistic about 2024, especially in the second half of the year and beyond. Looking at our energy markets, oil and gas market sales totaled $3.6 million in the fourth quarter, which is 38% higher than the third quarter, although 32% lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting our shift of production to higher margin aerospace products in 2023. That shift is also reflected in full year oil and gas sales that totaled $14 million, a decline of 22% from 2022. Oil and gas sales were 4% of total 2023 sales. We plan to temporarily continue to strategically shift our production assets to aerospace in 2024. That same shift, especially for finishing capacity, is evident in our power generation market sales, which were $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, while that's up 51% from the third quarter, full year 2023 sales were down 31% from a year ago to $4.2 million or just 1% of sales. I noted last time that as we continue to ramp our production levels, we remain very well positioned to expand our sales into the energy markets in the future. Now let me turn the call over to Steve for his report on our financials."", 'Steven DiTommaso', ""Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I have to start by telling you that it feels good to be here before the end of March reporting our results as we committed to you back in January. 2023 was a unique year for us, and we capped it off with our best financial performance since mid-2018 by several measures, including a record-setting top line. But before I dive deeper into the numbers, I'd like to update you on the anticipated filing of our annual report and Form 10-K tomorrow. And in section 9A of that document, you will find management's report on internal control over financial reporting where we describe material weaknesses and internal control as of December 31, 2023. Some detail of those weaknesses will be disclosed in the document, but I would like to provide context some perspective today. The main item to emphasize is that there is no restatement of numbers in the current period or any prior period. And the financial statements present fairly in all material respects the results and consolidated financial position of the Company. The core of the weaknesses relates to process and documentation. We have already started improvement actions and our existing processes will be enhanced to meet the standard required to remediate the weaknesses. Internal control weaknesses are being addressed and will be subject to remediation testing in future periods. We will continue to update you as we make progress in that effort, we cannot commit to a specific timeline for formal remediation. However, this is a top priority, and we are focused on implementing control enhancements immediately as we turn around and close the books on Q1 2024. Back to the numbers, Chris already highlighted our record top line sales achievement despite a sequential decline in raw material surcharges per pound within our selling prices. This was the result of many positives, more shipment volume, higher base prices and a higher mix of demand. Then melted products that top line drove an increase in gross margin, which reached $13.1 million in the fourth quarter or 16.4% of sales, an increase from 15.3% in the third quarter and 4.3% in the 2022 fourth quarter. Note that the prior year fourth quarter was impacted by outages at key production units and those did not recur this year. The sequential increase was driven by a combination of price and shipment volume as described already and lower costs as we are beginning to see benefits from increased productivity and better production efficiency. In addition, the margin would have been nearly two percentage points higher if it were not for the $1.6 million of raw material headwind. Chris mentioned selling, general and administrative costs in the fourth quarter totaled $8.3 million compared with $6.4 million in Q3. About $1.5 million of the $1.9 million increase is attributable to employee costs. The remaining increase was due to the higher cost of Business Insurance as we renew our policies annually on October first and incurred a premium increase during the current year renewal. For the full year, SG&A expenses increased $6.4 million to $27.8 million from $21.2 million in 2022 and the drivers were the same as those for the quarter. Employee costs made up nearly $5 million of that change. Business Insurance contributed $1.2 million and higher accounting and auditing fees rounded out the increase. The insurance component and portions of the employee costs will persist, but we expect other elements to come down from their Q4 2023 highs, and we expect our first quarter 2024 SG&A expense to approximate $7.5 million. Our operating income of $4.8 million was $400,000 better than Q3 and well ahead of the operating loss posted in the fourth quarter of 2022. The last time we saw operating income of this level was mid of 2018 on considerably higher shipment volume as we continue to execute our growth strategy, deliver on the top line and bring SG&A back to $7.5 million. We will drive more expansion and operating income in the in the coming quarters. Total interest expense for the quarter was $2.2 million, approximately flat to Q3 and up about $600,000 from the prior year fourth quarter. Average debt during the fourth quarter was about $6 million lower in 2023 compared to last year, but term SOFR rates climb from about 3.5% on average during the prior year quarter to 5.3% throughout Q4 2023. Interest expense rose sequentially each quarter in 2022 and this year before flattening in Q4, we expect that trend to reverse now each quarter as we step through 2024, we reported an income tax benefit of about $20,000 on our pretax income during the quarter, resulting in an effective tax rate of close to zero. This rate would be similar to our annual ETR if not for the impact of discrete items on the quarter. Our income tax expense for the year was about $400,000 on pretax income of $4.9 million for an effective ETR of 7.5% for the year. The effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the impact of our research and development tax credits, which decreased income tax expense for the period. This benefit is partly offset by about $300,000 of tax expense from forfeited stock options. Other elements of the rate calculation are not significant. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.6 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter EBITDA was $9.6 million, bringing our full year 2023 EBITDA to nearly $33 million compared with $12.8 million last year. Our adjusted EBITDA was $10 million for the quarter and $34.2 million for the year. Adjusted EBITDA includes an add-back for ship noncash share compensation, and there is a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. In the tables to the press release. We generated more than $7 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2023 operating cash generation to over $25 million. After spending $13 million on capital expenditures for the year, we used the remaining operating cash to pay down debt and expand our liquidity. Our debt reduction in Q4 totaled $4 million, and we expect to pay down debt each quarter in 2024, beginning with about $3 million in Q1. Debt reductions expected to accelerate in the second half on higher sales, higher margins and managing limited growth in working capital. We also expect to spend about $16 million to $18 million on capital expenditures in full year 2024. This concludes the financial update, and I'll hand the call back to Chris."", 'Christopher Zimmer', ""Thanks, Steve. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results indicate our growth strategy is kicking into high gear. Commercial aerospace demand remains robust and our participation in defense is growing approvals and new orders are rolling in as the primes want us in their supply chain. We're seeing that in backlog, which remained strong at $318 million, While order entry also remains healthy. We've expanded our premium alloy capacity and capabilities with the capital investment in North Jackson, the balance of our end-markets offers continued opportunity, including model changeovers for tool steel demand, onshoring and expansion in the chip manufacturer for our general industrial sales and in energy, the need for our grades of steel for drilling in hostile environments and construction and maintenance of gas turbines. Profitability is strengthening with the gross margin of 16.4% at a five-year high three years of price increases and increasing premium alloy sales are expanding our top line and margins. We've reduced debt as we continue to generate positive cash flow and plan to reduce debt further in 2024. First quarter results are thus far indicating that our growth is continuing we are genuinely excited about our future and the growth momentum we are seeing for 2024 and beyond. We plan to keep our heads down and execute. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, we're ready for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Phil Gibbs, KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Phil Gibbs', ""This is in general -- sense of just revenues and gross margins in the first quarter as you've got pretty good visibility now at the tail end of the quarter you were at the tail end of the quarter rather?"", 'Christopher Zimmer', ""I think that the key components that we've been talking about, we'll see that continue into the fourth quarter. We're not quite wrapped up with the numbers yet, but I would continue to see that sequential top line growth, margin expansion and debt reduction."", 'Phil Gibbs', 'And you mentioned in your script that you would anticipate the misalignment to be behind you by the end of the second quarter, assuming that raw material prices sort of stay where they are now, we have to the first quarter has a pretty similar impact as the fourth and then and then that will nicely moderate in Q2.', 'Christopher Zimmer', ""Yeah, that's right.

The company is gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. "", 'Walmart has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.The strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled Walmart’s fourth-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.However, the retail landscape continues to be dynamic due to challenges like inflation and volatile consumer spending.

The company supplies a wide range of gases crucial for various sectors like energy, steel, healthcare, manufacturing and electronics.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers, backed by minimum purchase requirements, ensuring stable cash flows. Linde’s substantial backlog ensures future earnings potential. The merger of Praxair and Linde has positioned the firm as an efficient player in the profitable industrial gas market, with a considerable size advantage.However, rising competition for new projects in emerging markets raises concerns. The decrease in U.S. industrial production is also expected to reduce the demand for industrial gases, affecting profits.

The company is poised to witness a healthy growth momentum driven by an optimum combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and steady R&D investments.Higher demand for hybrid cloud, AI solutions and increased watsonx adoption by clients are tailwinds. IBM’s collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.However, frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks.

If you want to skip our overview of the billionaire investor and dividend investing, then you can take a look at 29 Percent of Billionaire Cooperman's Portfolio is Invested in These 5 Dividend Stocks."", ""Leon Cooperman is one of the most seasoned hands on Wall Street and an investor who has seen nearly all of the ups and downs on the world's biggest stock markets. Born in 1943, Cooperman belongs to an era before today's fancy computers and high frequency algorithmic trading, Cooperman has lived across market downturns, upturns, and once in a generation shifts such as the rise of technology stocks and artificial intelligence."", ""Safe to say, this provides him with a perspective that's almost unmatched on Wall Street and places the investor right alongside some of the best known hedge fund bosses in the world such as Stanley Druckenmiller and Ken Fisher. Mr. Cooperman has spent decades playing with money on Wall Street, and he entered the finance industry in 1967 after graduating from the illustrious Columbia Business School. After spending decades at the investment bank, Cooperman set up his hedge fund Omega Advisors and ran the fund for decades before closing shop and retiring in 2016."", ""Since then, Cooperman has been investing through his family office called Omega Advisors. According to Insider Monkey's research, Mr. Cooperman's investment portfolio was worth $2.1 billion by the end of last year's fourth quarter. This marked a substantial growth of $500 million or 31% annually and demonstrated that even as the rest of the investing world was wary of piling money into the stock market amidst a rapid interest rate hiking cycle by the Federal Reserve, Cooperman was silently growing his investments."", ""In Q4 2022, Cooperman's three largest investments in terms of monetary value were Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP), and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI). Out of the three, only Mr. Cooper is among the top three in the investor's latest portfolio, as he trimmed his stakes in Q1 2023 and Q2 2023. Out of them, Devon Energy is an oil and gas company that has featured in Mr. Cooperman's portfolio since the first quarter of 2021. Between March 2021 and June 2022, the shares jumped by 227% as the global oil industry felt the pressure from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Cigna Group is more of a longer-term Leon Cooperman stock pick, as it first made an appearance in the portfolio in the Q4 2018 investment portfolio. Since then, the shares have gained 86% in terms of price appreciation, making it a great stock to just buy, hold, and forget. Finally, Omega Advisors also bought Mr. Cooper in Q4 2018. Since then, the shares have gained a whopping 509% in terms of share price appreciation - making them a great way to have more than doubled your money if you were following Leon Cooperman."", ""Finally, before we get to Leon Cooperman's latest dividend stock picks, a brief primer on dividends is necessary. A dividend is a payout to a shareholder from a firm's post tax profits. Not all firms pay dividends, and those that do not, typically hold the money in an account called retained earnings. A firm's dividends are evaluated with its share price, and dividing the annual dividend paid by the share price leads to a dividend yield - which is the percentage of the share price paid out as dividends. Investors also value dividend stocks through what is called a Gordon Growth Model, to see if changes in dividend policy can affect a firm's valuation."", ""As for Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP), here's what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about the firm in its fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter:"", 'Mortgage-servicing company Mr. Cooper Group rose alongside financials in the wake of the Fed’s November meeting, which investors broadly interpreted to signal an end to rate hikes and a potential pivot to cuts sometime in 2024.

Let's take a closer look at these two consumer discretionary stocks and see how they compare."", 'Founded more than 30 years after Nike, Lululemon, which posted fiscal 2023 revenue of $9.6 billion, is a much smaller entity. However, its growth has been truly spectacular. That 2023 sales figure was about 200% higher than five years earlier.', ""Lululemon has done a great job at transitioning from a brand known purely as a seller of women's yoga attire to a highly regarded men's and women's athletic clothing provider. The business is now in the footwear market as well. Looking ahead, it's easy to believe these trends will continue because there is a huge opportunity to expand internationally."", 'Even during what has been a difficult time for consumer spending, the company reported a 16% revenue gain in its fiscal fourth quarter, and executives believe an 11%-plus increase is likely for the current fiscal year.', ""Besides its growth, Lululemon bests Nike in the profitability department.

He says there has been a shift in the type of customer buying outdoor-wear over recent years.', '“These customers are a bit different,” he says. “They can be younger but maybe not – more importantly, they’re approaching the outdoors in a different way.”', 'The aesthetic has since been catapulted into the mainstream. On Asos, there are three separate guides on how to style yourself to get the look. M&S recently suggested its shoppers try the “surprisingly wearable” trend.', 'Increasingly, retailers are starting to dedicate more shelf-space to these smaller outdoors brands, a move which comes at the expense of sportswear giants Nike and Adidas. Archive data for the website of one major UK sportswear retailer suggests that the number of Nike trainers on sale has shrunk by around a third since 2021.', 'It is a similar picture in the US, where figures from YipitData found that Nike and Adidas both experienced a drop in the footwear category at Dick’s Sporting Goods, the largest sportswear retail chain in America.', 'Meanwhile, shoe retailer Footlocker reported that 36pc of its sales came from brands outside of Nike last year, compared to 32pc a year earlier. Among its fastest growing brands were Hoka and On Running.', 'One sportswear veteran says retailers have introduced new brands into their stores because the designs from Nike and Adidas were simply not exciting enough. “They haven’t had as much creativity in recent years and so everyone had to look at these new brands like Hoka and On Running,” he says.', 'Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, agrees it is a matter of brands prioritising creating innovative designs and looks.', '“Both Nike and Adidas have gone through a couple of years of slower innovation relying on key franchises like Air Force One,” she says. “You have definitely seen more interesting designs coming from On Running, New Balance and Hoka.”', 'While Adidas and Nike remain the biggest players in sportswear, the rise of these smaller brands is causing a headache for both, Calvert says.', 'In February, Deckers, which owns Hoka, posted a 22pc increase in sales of the trainers brand to hit $429m (£340m) for the third quarter compared with a year earlier.', 'Swiss athletics brands On Running raked in sales of £1.6bn in 2023, a surge of 47pc compared with the year prior.', '“Outdoor enthusiasts and young urbanites alike have been gravitating to gorpcore’s functional, outdoors-inspired fashion, such as shell jackets and hiking-style sneakers,” McKinsey analysts wrote in a recent report.', '“In the year ahead, brands are expected to forge ever-closer ties between style and utility as lifestyle brands deepen investment in the outdoors, and outdoor brands increasingly court fashion-focused customers.”', 'According to UK figures from GlobalData, between 2019 and 2022, Hoka and On Running both made significant gains. Hoka went from holding 0.5pc of the sportswear market in 2019 to 1.6pc in 2022 and On Running from 0.3pc to 0.6pc.', 'Nike’s share of the sportswear market, meanwhile, slipped from 14.1pc to 13.2pc. Adidas fell from 11pc to 9.6pc. There is still a crucial gap between the leaders and their rivals. But, signs that shoppers are switching to other brands will add to frustrations among the sportswear incumbents.', 'Earlier this month, Adidas posted its first loss in more than 30 years after ending its lucrative trainer partnership with Kanye West following a string of anti-Semitic comments made by the rapper.', 'The German sportswear giant recorded a loss of €58m (£50m) from its continuing operations in 2023 compared to a €254m profit a year earlier. Revenues were down around 5pc at €21.4bn in 2023, with the discontinuation of the Yeezy deal contributing to a €500m decline in sales during 2023.', 'Meanwhile, at Nike, Williams Trading analysts say that “demand for its product is waning”. In its latest set of results earlier this month, Nike said revenues were slightly higher than last year.', 'However, it follows a series of gloomy updates where management have warned that it is becoming more difficult to get shoppers to spend between holidays such as Black Friday.', 'Shares in Nike are down by around a fifth over the past year. The decline has wiped out the pandemic-linked boost, when locked-down households stocked up on tracksuit bottoms and soft athleisure wear.', '“We remain unconvinced that Nike has the experienced team in place that can identify and execute what’s needed to get Nike firmly back on its tracks,” analysts at Williams Trading said. “It appears as if Nike is looking backwards from a product perspective to move forward.”', 'Nike executives refute that it has been slow on the uptake. In a blog post to customers last year, the company said when customers were trying to figure out what to wear hiking, “it’s all about performance pieces that keep you dry, comfortable and protected from the elements. But also, a little aesthetic, please and thanks”.', '“After all, hiking clothes don’t mean sacrificing style – yes, gorpcore.” It suggested shoppers buy its Zegama Trail running shoes and Therma-FIT jackets.', 'Still, not everyone is convinced. At The Outsiders Store, Rothery says they are not stocking any Nike shoes. It has a handful of Adidas designs which it sells, but the number is dwarfed by the numbers of Hoka and Salomon trainers. “For sure, those are the key brands for us.”', 'It seems, for now at least, Nike and Adidas still need to find their footing. Both have suffered a series of stumbles. Perhaps, like Biden, the answer lies in looking to brands like Hoka or On Running for inspiration. It could, after all, give them the stability the sportswear companies sorely need.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

FC Barcelona terminated its contract with the company and Nike was also lambasted for its new soccer kit for the England team, which tweaked the colors of the St. George’s Cross, altering them from the traditional white and red combination to red, purple, blue and black for the Euro 2024 tournament that gets underway in June.', 'On the upside, though, Nike recently scored a major win by ousting its rival Adidas as the German Football Association’s official kit supplier for its national soccer teams starting in the 2027 season and running until 2034. Another bright spot is Iowa State basketball player Caitlin Clark, whose popularity has soared among women, men and children since Nike first signed her in 2022.', 'Of the recent missteps, Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at Global Data, pointed to the MLB uniform issue as being “the biggest potential challenge as they undermine Nike’s stances of being high-quality and having very reliable products.”', 'Although Nike still has an enviable position in the market — it remains by far the market leader in activewear — and is seen by most consumers as being “a leading sportswear company,” it is in danger of “losing its edge — especially as younger companies like On are seen as being more innovative and interesting,” Saunders contended.\xa0“There is a sense that Nike is on the back foot right now and it needs to work hard to get its mojo back. The latest stumbles do not help it to achieve this.”', 'While companies like On and Hoka are tiny compared to Nike, they are generating “fantastic growth and gaining ground with customers,” he said. “This is a threat to Nike. As the biggest player in the market, the danger for Nike is that it sees its share eroded by a lot of other players nibbling away. They don’t need to take big bites to have a material impact.”', 'Even as up-and-comers like On and Hoka nip at its heels, Nike has been dealing with mixed sales, including sluggish growth in China in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, its most recent. This has led to rumblings among analysts that, given the company’s woes, Nike chief executive officer John Donahoe’s days could be numbered. Donahoe joined Nike in January 2020 after stints at ServiceNow Inc. and PayPal Holdings. “Nike leadership is in the hot seat,” wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy, and a change at the top could help boost the stock price. Morgan Stanley analysts agreed that a CEO change could “reignite bullishness on the stock.”', 'But Donahoe is digging in his heels and taking steps to address the issues.', 'When sluggish second-quarter earnings were released at the end of last year, the company revealed $2 billion in cost-cutting measures over the next three years as a way to streamline the organization. This included layoffs — some 1,500 jobs, or 2 percent of the workforce was eliminated in February — simplifying product and increasing automation.', 'But these cuts could ultimately wind up hurting the company in the long run, according to Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser.', '“Nike’s current C-suite leaders lack the levels of brand and Nike institutional knowledge that the leaders had in 2015,” wrote Poser in his pre-Chistmas notes that were titled “The Bain of Nike’s Existence,” (a double entendre about Donahoe’s Bain consulting and nonproduct-oriented experience). “Many seasoned Nike executives across many parts of the corporation were let go or have left the company on their own accord since 2020.” And some newer hires like chief technology officer Muge Erdirik Dogan, a former Amazon executive, lacked the brand-first knowhow, according to Poser.', 'Having issued a sell rating on Nike’s stock, Poser compared the company’s situation to breaking a bone — “the problems can happen very quickly, but the fixes always take longer. This feels like a version of that. Again, Nike’s not going away or anything. They’re a great big company,” he said.', 'Even Nike recognizes its challenges. On the company’s third-quarter earnings call last week, Donahoe said: “Looking at our business, Q3 performed in line with our expectations. That said, we know Nike is not performing at our potential.”', 'In the third quarter, the athletic giant said revenues grew marginally over last year to $12.4 billion, ahead of the $12.28 billion expected by analysts and ahead of prior guidance from the company. Net income was down 5 percent to $1.2 billion.', 'Changing tack', 'In a sign of the changing tides, the company is now backpedaling on some of the initiatives that it had instituted in the past, notably its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, which resulted in the brand de-emphasizing its wholesale channels to focus on direct-to-consumer. Donahoe acknowledged last week this strategy was in need of “some important adjustments.” That includes the reentry into retailers such as Macy’s and DSW and beefing up its presence in others such as Foot Locker.', 'In his call to analysts, Donahoe outlined four priorities: sharpen the focus on sport, offer a continuous flow of new product innovation, institute bolder brand and more distinctive marketing and lean in with wholesale partners to elevate the brand and grow the total marketplace. In addition, Heidi O’Neill and Craig Williams are now copresidents, and the company has accelerated the launch of several innovations by more than a year, according to Donahoe.', 'Donahoe said Nike’s cushioning platform, the Air franchise, is a double-digit billion-dollar business on its own — “larger than some Fortune 500 companies” — and delivers “performance benefits for athletes and defines the future of sportswear.” At the Olympics this summer, he predicted that Air will “drive major advancements in measurable performance benefits on the track, on the court and on the pitch.”', 'An Olympics innovation summit will be held by Nike in Paris in early April to unveil new Air products in football, basketball and track. And the company is expanding the Air lineup across its lifestyle footwear portfolio as well, he said, with the introduction of the Air Max Dn, that is “deeply rooted in youth culture.” That hit more than 4,000 stores globally on Air Max Day on March 26.', 'However, its introduction wasn’t quite what Nike had hoped, according to Poser. In notes released Wednesday, he said the Air Max Day and the Air Max Dn release “did not live up to the hype, and demand for Nike continues to wane.”', 'He said the Air Max DN has been deemed a “dud” by a number of retailers, and “is not the beginning of a Nike turnaround.” Poser said the men’s black/purple did sell well, as did the neon yellow, but the other colors were “non-starters, and we would not be surprised if the Air Max Dn gets marked down in stores within the next two months.”', 'Other analysts are also skeptical. Although they acknowledge that Nike is still the largest and most successful sports brand, they’re looking for more newness and impactful marketing for the company to regain its mojo.', '“Nike has lost some of its brand heat,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, attributing that to its “lack of newness and innovation.” In contrast, Hoka and On are “both hot brands” and even the more-established companies such as Asics are “doing a better job on innovation.” In its third quarter, Hoka reported a sales jump of 22 percent to $429.3 million from the same period last year, and Swiss brand On Holdings continues to raise its profile in the U.S. with sales rising 22 percent to 447 million Swiss francs in its fourth quarter.', 'Even Lululemon is making inroads. Already a strong competitor to Nike with its apparel, the Vancouver-based company recently introduced men’s sneakers, and results on the product in the fourth quarter far exceeded expectations, according to CEO Calvin McDonald. Women’s footwear debuted in early 2022.', 'In addition, Johnson said, Nike has to “correct the issue of moving too far toward the direct-to-consumer business. That was the big bugaboo.” He said the company shouldn’t abandon DTC, or its flagships, “but overexpanding beyond major flagships” and not beefing up its presence at major department and specialty stores is a bad idea. “They need to restore a more-traditional balance,” he said.', 'Johnson said that consumers in the sports sector are “fairly fickle, driven by social media,” and Hoka and On are the brands with the most buzz today. In the past year, On increased its market share in the sports market to 2 percent from 1 percent the year before. Although still small in comparison to Nike, which has a 26 percent market share, and Adidas, with about 9 percent, On still has limited distribution and “so much runway” to expand its reach — and scarcity generally leads to higher demand from some sneakerheads.', '“Nike lost half a step but a lot of kids still love them and they’re still the dominant brand,” Johnson said, so don’t count the company out just yet.', 'And he doesn’t expect Donahoe to be the fall guy. “If Nike does a transition, it won’t be sudden, like Under Armour,” he said of the surprise announcement earlier this month that the Baltimore-based UA was bringing back its founder, Kevin Plank, as CEO, replacing Stephanie Linnartz who had held the top spot for only two years.', '“If Nike is in the same soft patch a year from now and they continue to lose market share, the board will have to do something,” he said.', 'Retail analyst and author Bruce Winder also weighed in: “Nike is no stranger to controversy and that in part helps define its brand. They push the envelope whether through design, social issues in advertising and other components of their go-to-market strategy.\xa0“', 'He added, “When you’re the queen of an industry, everyone is gunning for you — trying to dethrone you and grab the crown. They are used to that and somehow always come out on top.”', 'But Winder thinks that one day “we will see Nike fall from grace as newer generations will find alternative brands more attractive and Nike will be seen as a legacy brand, losing accessibility based on its premium pricing strategy in a world of lower disposable incomes for youth overall.”', 'Tom Nikic, senior vice president of equity research for apparel and footwear at Wedbush Securities, said, “The biggest issue we’ve seen has been the lack of product innovation, which is something we have seen from Hoka and On. Nike became so fixated on their DTC strategy and where they were selling their stuff, they lost focus on what they were selling. So other companies caught the attention of consumers by offering styles and colors they’d never seen before.”', 'Been Here Before', 'Of course, this is not the first time Nike has had to look over its shoulder at its competitors. Reebok, Adidas and even Under Armour have caught the attention of consumers at various times over the course of Nike’s half century-plus in business. “And in the past when they’ve gotten into situations like this, they’ve pulled themselves out with product innovation,” Nikic said.', 'In the last couple of years, however, business has not played out like Nike expected, Nikic said, pointing to significantly higher overhead expenses and a larger workforce. “They made a lot of investments, but the return hasn’t panned out,” he said. “Nike isn’t a company that succeeds because it cost-cuts itself to prosperity. They invest in product development and innovation and the DTC experience. So we hope this [$2 billion in cost cutting] is a one-time thing.”', 'The upcoming Olympic Games could be just the catalyst Nike needs, he said, as long as the company has new product innovation to market. “There are billions of eyes around the world on your brand and Nike will spent a lot on marketing, but success will depend on the quality of the product they have to sell to the consumer.”', 'Martin Lindstrom, an author and branding expert, believes Nike needs to take a more-localized view of its business in order to regain its popularity. “The idea of being a global brand is fading away,” he said. “We are in an existential crisis with depression and anxiety as high as we’ve ever seen in the U.S. People are looking for purpose and not for a brand to be everything to everyone. Consumers have changed 180 degrees and brands need to change 180 degrees too. They need to reconnect with the consumer, be more nimble and shift quickly.”', 'In contrast, Simeon Siegel, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, offered what he calls a “contrary view” to other analysts and observers.', '“Nike is an incredible company with global reach, and just like digitally native start-ups never killed the department stores, even if Nike’s brand heat is less than it was, they’re still selling a lot of sneakers. The demise of Nike has been exaggerated.”', 'Siegel pointed to the long history of competition that Nike has faced, such as Adidas poaching Kanye West and launching the Ultraboost, “but Nike still had its foundation. It doesn’t mean they catch every trend, or need to, to be relevant to the consumer. They still have $50 billion of revenue and every high-level endorser.”', 'Even though it lost Tiger Woods and other high-profile athletes, Siegel doesn’t think that ultimately makes a difference to Nike’s long-term success. “Outside of Jordan, they’re not dependent on any one person. Nike had Steph Curry at the beginning of his career. They’ve lost people before and survived.”', 'And with the Olympics now just months away, it could help jump-start Nike’s rebound. “The Olympics are good for all sport,” he said. “This is the ultimate stage and you’re going to see a lot of swooshes on people’s feet. It will show a business that has not lost its luster.”', 'Best of WWD', 'Confidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?', 'San Francisco Authorities Seize Nearly $2 Million in Suspected Stolen Merchandise', 'Year in Review: The IPO Rush Transforming Fashion']"

And I think what we are seeing is the smaller brands are coming with a lot of innovation.”', 'Schultz clarified on the call that when he says innovation, he means new ideas in color, silhouette and material, not necessarily in “new technology that transforms the world.” Adidas, he said, is one company that is doing this concept well.', '“A good example of that is the excellent work that Adidas is doing on the Samba and also Terrex brand,” the CEO noted. “Every month we have new release of the same silhouette, but with a little bit of twist, and that’s working very well. It works very well with size, which is, for us, an early sign of this coming for the market.”', 'Back at Nike, Schultz noted that the new Air Max Dn sneaker that launched Tuesday was a good example of the type of launches the brand needs to be doing going forward. “The most important thing is for Nike to recognize that they need to bring something new to the market,” he said. “And we see some product coming for end of the year, but mostly beginning of next year, that are exciting as a buyer.”', 'This sentiment comes one day after several analysts gave their own takes on how Nike’s Air Max Day went this year. The event, which marks the anniversary of the first-ever Air Max launch in 1987, came at a precarious time for Nike, which has recently come under criticism for its lack of innovative new products. In response to the criticism, Nike last week announced its plan to build a “multiyear cycle of innovation” to win over consumers.', 'But the slowdown in its Nike business didn’t affect the company’s “outperformance” in fiscal 2024.

Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi’s overall performance…” (Click here to see the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60', 'Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2', 'Cisco Systems, Inc.

The stock is still down tremendously from its former highs from years ago. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding the company right now. The new CEO, Alex Chriss, is trying to bring the business back to relevancy.', 'Is it too late to buy PayPal stock? No, the comeback story is just getting started.', 'Here is what you need to know.', ""PayPal is one of the first fintechs. The company's story goes back to the late 1990s. However, the payments industry is super competitive, and PayPal seems to have lost its magic. It bolted on acquisitions over time, but investors grew impatient with the company's lack of innovation."", ""It may be a stale company, but it's very much alive. The company is still generating over $4 billion in annual cash flow and has more cash on the balance sheet than it does debt. Financially speaking, PayPal is in great shape:"", 'Active users declined by 2% year over year in the fourth quarter, but monthly active users increased by 1% to 224 million. Monthly active users will be where investors want to focus moving forward. There are 426 million total active accounts today, so the question is how many of those 202 million non-monthly users it can get to engage more frequently.', ""Alex Chriss seems to be focusing his early attention on this. In Q4, the company outlined a strategic priority of growing its branded checkout product. Additionally, PayPal noted intent to use its first-party data more effectively. Supporting that is a recent developer conference that outlined some artificial intelligence (AI) features in PayPal's developer toolbox, including AI search and generative AI tools via collaboration with Microsoft."", ""PayPal was the first major financial institution to launch its stablecoin, a crypto token pegged to the U.S. dollar. It's new, having launched in August 2023, so it's still too early to judge. It allows users to quickly process transactions by converting them through cryptocurrency instead of the traditional settlement process that fiat funds require, which can take days."", 'Of course, focusing on AI and crypto is not guaranteed to lure new users or spur engagement successfully. Still, these are necessary features for a payment company trying to maintain a modern image.', ""Understanding PayPal's investment opportunity requires understanding the stock's valuation and what a positive change in sentiment could mean for investment returns. For starters, PayPal trades for less than 13 times this year's estimated earnings. Since its spinoff from eBay, shares have averaged a 47 price-to-earnings ratio. In other words, PayPal is dirt cheap if you look at where it once traded."", ""That sets the stock up for two types of investment returns: growth-driven and valuation expansion. Analysts expect PayPal to grow earnings by an annual average of 9% over the next three to five years. If the valuation stays the same, investors will enjoy that growth as investment gains. At a PEG ratio of 1.3, the stock is arguably cheap for that expected growth. Therefore, I don't think there's a huge risk of the valuation collapsing much further without something happening to the business."", 'The valuation could also expand, resulting in tremendous investment returns if Wall Street were ever to revalue the stock anywhere close to its historical averages. What could cause this? A positive change in sentiment if Wall Street likes what Alex Chriss does with the company over the coming quarters. The stock would have to increase fourfold to trade at that P/E average of 48!', ""So, investors can consider a range of possible outcomes. At one end, the company stays the same. It's financially stable and chugs along at a high-single-digit growth rate. Conversely, the stock could multiply in value from a successful turnaround. Of course, the outcome could fall somewhere in the middle."", ""The important part is that there are far more potentially good outcomes than bad ones in this range of possibilities. That's a favorable risk-to-reward situation, which means investors can swing at shares here and potentially do well over the long term."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company is gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. "", 'Walmart has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.The strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled Walmart’s fourth-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.However, the retail landscape continues to be dynamic due to challenges like inflation and volatile consumer spending. High SG&A expenses are also a concern.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)Shares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+35.0% vs. +30.9%). The company has an extensive range of industrial gas applications that are enhancing global productivity day by day. The company supplies a wide range of gases crucial for various sectors like energy, steel, healthcare, manufacturing and electronics.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers, backed by minimum purchase requirements, ensuring stable cash flows. Linde’s substantial backlog ensures future earnings potential. The merger of Praxair and Linde has positioned the firm as an efficient player in the profitable industrial gas market, with a considerable size advantage.However, rising competition for new projects in emerging markets raises concerns. The decrease in U.S. industrial production is also expected to reduce the demand for industrial gases, affecting profits. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>)IBM’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+53.9% vs. +42.9%). The company is poised to witness a healthy growth momentum driven by an optimum combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and steady R&D investments.Higher demand for hybrid cloud, AI solutions and increased watsonx adoption by clients are tailwinds. IBM’s collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.However, frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks. In addition, buyouts have negatively impacted the company’s balance sheet in the form of high levels of goodwill and net intangible assets.

If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.', ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)."", 'Now, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.', ""So naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro."", ""Yet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors."", ""NVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:"", ""Yes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence."", ""Jensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin."", 'So, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers."", 'Boston Beer reported dismal fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, the company reported a year-over-year decline in revenues, along with a widened loss per share. The decline mainly resulted from soft trends in the Truly brand, which caused lower shipments and depletions.The company also noted that the fourth-quarter 2023 results included 13 weeks, while fourth-quarter 2022 had 14 weeks. This impacted its top and bottom-line performances.The company’s loss per share of $1.49 in fourth-quarter 2023 was wider than the loss of 93 cents in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 22 cents. The decline mainly resulted from soft top-line trends, accompanied by higher operating costs.Net revenues declined 12% year over year to $393.7 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $416 million. The dip in the company’s fourth-quarter revenues included an impact of 8.9 percentage points from the 14th week in 2022.

Decreased shipment and depletion resulted from declines in Truly Hard seltzer, partly negated by growth in the Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams Non-Alcoholic styles and Dogfish Head Canned cocktails.The gross profit declined 10.6% year over year to $147.9 million, whereas it expanded 60 basis points (bps) to 37.6% from 37% in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin primarily benefited from strong price realization, reduced inventory obsolescence and procurement savings. This was partly offset by higher inflationary costs, third-party production shortfall fees and brewery processing costs per barrel due to lower volumes.Advertising, promotional and selling expenses declined 7.6% in the reported quarter to $128.6 million due to lower freight to distributors of $11.8 million on reduced rates and volumes. This was partly offset by higher brand investments and selling costs of $1.2 million mainly related to increased media investments.General and administrative expenses rose 5% year over year to $43.7 million mainly due to higher salaries and benefits costs.The company reported an operating loss of $25.9 million compared with a loss of $16.8 million in the year-ago quarter.', 'As of Dec 30, 2023, Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of $298.5 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $1,077.9 million.

This was witnessed in 2023 when dividend equities faded into the background because of the tech rally. That said, companies in the S&P 500 still paid record amounts of dividends last year, underscoring the significance of dividend stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the index distributed $588.2 billion in dividends to shareholders last year, up from $564.6 billion in 2022. In addition to this, 707 companies in the S&P 500 reported dividend increases in the fourth quarter of the year, totaling $17.5 billion, which also showed growth from $16.3 billion increases during the same period last year.', 'When investing in dividend stocks, there is a constant battle between dividend yields and dividend growth. While high yields may be attractive, focusing on dividend growth signifies the financial stability and strength of the company. That said, both high-yield stocks and dividend growers have given strong performances over the years in comparison to non-dividend stocks. A research paper published by New York University investigated the significance of dividend yields within dividend investing. The study created portfolios based on dividend yields at the start of every year from 1952 to 2002. The findings indicated that both high and low-dividend stocks delivered consistent performances, with one strategy outperforming the other during different timeframes. For example, from 1952 to 1971, high dividend portfolios outperformed those with low yields by nearly 3%. On the other hand, low-yield dividend stocks surpassed high-dividend stocks between 1971 and 1990.', 'Due to ongoing market fluctuations, analysts advise investors to keep including dividend stocks in their portfolios. Analysts’ inclination toward dividend stocks also comes from Meta’s announcement of its first-ever dividend, which indicates a growing trend of tech stocks joining the dividend club. With this announcement, financial experts have started examining the potential growth prospects of its dividend. Though Meta’s dividend growth in the coming years is still uncertain, the company is holding onto large cash reserves, which provides a solid foundation for maintaining its dividend payouts. This mainly illustrates the importance of dividend growth as a key factor in dividend investment strategy. Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about dividend growth stocks in one of the bank’s newsletters. Here is what she said:', '“Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'She further said:', '“One mistake to avoid is to buy a company’s stock simply because it issues a high dividend. Always take into account prospects for both growth and income and how they align with your particular needs and goals.”', 'Analysts focus on dividend growth due to its potential to provide long-term benefits to shareholders. However, some investors do not seek long-term benefits but rather focus on short-term gains from dividend stocks through a dividend capture strategy.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

But are all of them overvalued?', ""Let's examine this group and see if any could be considered cheap or if you'll need to pay a hefty premium to own these seven stocks."", 'The Magnificent Seven is made up of the following companies:', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', ""2023 was a phenomenal year for this cohort, with the worst-performing stock (Apple) returning nearly 50%. However, 2024 hasn't been so kind, and each stock's performance has been all over the place."", ""Part of this dichotomy has been valuation, as investors aren't willing to pay up to own some of the stocks in the Magnificent Seven."", ""Because the Magnificent Seven are mostly considered growth companies, I'll use their revenue growth combined with their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to assess their valuation; I believe these two metrics show a wider picture. Cost reduction measures can prop up earnings, but those can only grow earnings for so long without any top-line growth."", 'Tesla has had the worst year, losing nearly a third of its value this year. Its declining market value can be attributed to slowing growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales and shrinking margins due to rising competition. The really high premium that investors were willing to pay for the stock tumbled, and now the stock trades for 55 times forward earnings.', ""Apple is in a similar situation, but its problems have occurred for much longer. Throughout 2023, Apple's quarterly revenue either shrank or grew at a 2% pace on a year-on-year basis. That's not great for a company valued like a growth stock, so it is no surprise that investors aren't willing to pay as much of a premium. Even at its current 26 times forward earnings, the stock still looks pricey for its growth."", ""Besides these two, the rest are up in 2024, but that doesn't mean they are all overpriced."", ""Alphabet and Meta Platforms come to the top of the list for stocks that I believe aren't overpriced. Alphabet, Google's parent company, has had some public relations issues related to the rollout of its generative AI model. However, Alphabet's ad business is still doing well, and with the company trading at 22 times forward earnings, it's the cheapest on the list."", ""Meta isn't much more expensive, with the stock trading at 25.5 times forward earnings. Since its primary business is advertising (through its various social media platforms), it's benefiting from the same ad recovery wave as Alphabet. As a result, it's primed to continue growing for some time."", ""Nvidia isn't as expensive as some may expect, as its vast growth hasn't concluded yet. At 38 times forward earnings, it's quite pricey, but with Nvidia being at the center of the AI revolution with its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), it's to be expected."", ""Amazon is more difficult to assess. It's still optimizing its business for profits, so its forward earnings multiple is skewed and will likely remain that way for some time. At 42 times earnings, it's the second-most expensive on the list. However, with Amazon's rising gross profit margin, it will only be a matter of time before its profits rocket higher and its valuation looks more reasonable."", ""Lastly, Microsoft is one of the most expensive stocks on this list despite being the largest company in the world by market capitalization. Microsoft's valuation is an incredibly pricey 37 times forward earnings -- nearly as expensive as Nvidia's despite far less growth. It earned this premium through fantastic AI product rollout and increased cloud computing market share. However, 37 times earnings is a lot for a company growing at 18% that appears to be fully optimized for profits."", 'So, with all that information, how do these stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive?', ""Ranking the stocks by their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple alone doesn't tell the full picture, as companies like Apple are struggling to grow while Nvidia is tripling its revenue. These rankings won't solely be based on metrics; they'll also include a nod to current growth and future opportunities."", 'With that in mind, here are my rankings of the Magnificent Seven from the cheapest to most expensive:', 'Alphabet', 'Meta Platforms', 'Amazon', 'Nvidia', 'Tesla', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', ""Ranking Alphabet and Meta as the cheapest was a no-brainer, but I'm also convinced that Amazon and Nvidia have more room to grow, making their expensive valuations seem cheaper in the grand scheme of things. Tesla is hard to figure out, but if EV demand continues to rise, this may be a bargain price. Lastly, Microsoft and Apple are very expensive for their growth, with Apple being the worst offender because it's hardly growing."", 'Although this is my ranking, investors should decide for themselves whether any of these stocks are ""cheap"" enough to buy.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The gains weren\'t exactly broad-based though. Stocks dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- drove gains as they soared in the double or triple digits last year.', ""Of course, that's just a short-term increase. But these stocks have proven themselves over a longer period too. Let's take a look at the performance of each of these players over the past five years and see if they still represent compelling buy stories. Here they are, ranked from best to worst, according to performance."", ""Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings and share price growth truly took off thanks to its crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used to be best known for their role in gaming -- but the ability to rapidly process many tasks simultaneously made Nvidia's GPUs a perfect fit for AI."", ""Today, Nvidia holds about 80% of the AI chip market, and that's not likely to change as the company invests heavily to stay ahead of rivals. This tech giant just recently announced its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips ever, set for release later this year."", ""Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings and share price performance actually have slowed in recent times as various factors weigh on the electric vehicle giant -- from higher costs linked to production ramp-ups to negative foreign exchange impact."", 'But Tesla surged over the past five years as the company delivered more and more vehicles, opened major new factories, delivered record earnings, and built up more than $29 billion in cash. The cash level is particularly important because it will help this ambitious EV leader continue to innovate and potentially progress on programs such as self-driving technology.', ""So, Tesla's slowdown looks like a temporary situation, meaning growth probably isn't over for this market giant."", ""Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) brand strength has helped it keep users coming back to world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac -- and even continue to attract new customers. This has made Apple the go-to stock for the technology investor seeking growth and safety. The company even won over billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has almost half of his portfolio invested in the tech giant."", ""Some may worry that Apple's growth could plateau at a certain point, but one particular thing makes me confident that won't happen. The company's services -- sold to its growing user base -- have taken off, with services revenue reaching records. And this could drive a whole new era of growth for Apple."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), like Apple, is a classic tech company that's proven its strength over the long haul. But in recent times, Microsoft also has shown its ability to seize a growth opportunity. The company was an early believer in AI, investing $1 billion in OpenAI, the developer of chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019."", ""The tech powerhouse later extended the partnership and increased its investment, a move that also strengthened the company's cloud business, Azure. This business offers a wide variety of AI tools and has seen its revenue growth soar, rising 30% in the most recent period -- surpassing that of rivals Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Their revenue advanced 13% and 26%, respectively."", 'So, Microsoft clearly could be a winner in the potential AI revolution.', ""Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) went through a period of cost cutting in recent times, but at the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg planned for the next step for this social media giant. And that's building up strengths in AI. The company has gone all in on that, developing its own large language model and aiming to apply AI across its products and services."", ""On top of that, Meta's dominance in social media is unwavering, a key point since it, through advertising, brings in most of the company's revenue. It's easy to imagine AI further boosting the company's social media platforms and driving more growth."", ""Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has an extremely solid moat, or competitive advantage, in the business that brings in the lion's share of its revenue. And that's Google Search, which holds more than 90% of the global search market. This has kept advertisers coming back, even during recent times of higher inflation."", 'Today, Alphabet, like many of these Magnificent Seven companies, is investing in AI, and this technology is helping it to make search faster and better. This, along with AI offerings through Google Cloud, may power earnings growth in the coming years.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed during the early days of the pandemic as customers flocked to e-commerce -- but a couple of years later, higher inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and the wallets of its customers. And that hurt stock performance, making Amazon the worst-performing of the Magnificent Seven over the past five years (though a 100% gain isn't something to frown about)."", ""But the company revamped its cost structure\xa0and shifted from an annual loss in 2022 to solid profit in 2023, and the shares went on to gain. And this may continue thanks to Amazon's focus on AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its own operations and selling AI products and services through AWS, the world's cloud services leader."", ""Now, let's get back to our question: Do these high-flying stocks still represent compelling buys? As you can see in the chart, they remain reasonably priced in relation to forward earnings estimates if you consider the long-term growth prospects of each of these players."", ""Tesla is the most expensive by this measure, but these figures consider potential earnings next year -- which is rather short term. The EV giant's moves today to lower the costs of producing its vehicles and incorporate AI in its processes could pay off over the coming years, making today's valuation look fair. Still, other players like Alphabet or Meta clearly are cheap and may represent an even better buying opportunity right now."", ""And here's one important thing to note: Some of these companies went through rough patches in recent times, yet they still managed to deliver big gains over a five-year period. This is a great example of the power of long-term investing, which implies holding on to a stock for at least five years."", ""All of this means it's not too late to get in on some or all of the Magnificent Seven, a group of quality stocks that could continue to deliver top returns over the long haul."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But what does that really mean?', 'Well, Palantir\'s business model reminds me of a famous BASF advertising tagline: ""We don\'t make many of the products you buy; we make many of the products you buy better.""', 'In a nutshell, Palantir does the same thing, albeit in a very different way. The company uses AI-powered platforms to monitor and analyze data, with the goal of recognizing patterns and improving processes.', ""For example, Tampa General Hospital used Palantir's Foundry platform to reduce patient hold time in its Post-Anesthesia Care Unit by 28% through AI-driven data analysis. In addition, AI analysis of nurse schedules, surgery schedules, and census data has improved operational efficiency. After removing bottlenecks, the hospital's nurse staffing ratio increased by 30%."", ""As a result of its ability to drive real-world results, Palantir's AI platforms are in demand. Revenue increased from $0.9 billion in 2020 to $2.2 billion last year. What's more, analysts expect the company's sales to increase to $2.7 billion this year and $3.2 billion in 2025."", ""Although the majority of Palantir's revenue is from governmental organizations, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and the U.K.'s National Health Services, commercial customers are the future. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended on Dec. 31, 2023), Palantir's U.S. commercial customer count surged by 55% year over year. Its U.S. commercial revenue jumped 70% to $131 million."", ""Finally, let's talk about what is reasonable from a stock perspective. Palantir's shares currently trade for about $25. So, for a $20,000 investment to grow to $1 million, shares would need to hit a price of about $1,250. "", 'Needless to say, that would take an incredible amount of growth. In compound annual growth rate (CAGR) terms, shares would need to return 47% each year for 10 years.', 'Over a more reasonable 20 years, Palantir stock would still need a CAGR of almost 22% to turn $20,000 into $1 million.', ""That might be a bit much to expect despite Palantir's potential."", ""Nevertheless, long-term investors shouldn't overlook the company.

Not only can they give you a continuing source of cash to reinvest, but they also serve as powerful tools to align a company's management's priorities with its shareholders'."", ""This alignment comes because many companies offer their leadership some form of stock-based compensation. Thanks to a solid, supported, and generally rising dividend, that leadership has an incentive to hold on to the company's stock for the long haul. After all, the dividend can continue to reward them for their efforts long after they're done directly working for the company."", ""With that in mind, smart investors looking for dividends don't just focus on the company's current yield, but also on factors that show a commitment to maintaining and boosting that dividend over time. These two dividend stocks look like they fit that bill well enough to be worth considering as potential investments to double up on right now."", ""Genuine Parts (NYSE: GPC) is perhaps best known as the company behind the NAPA Auto Parts chain. That's a particularly useful economic niche to be a part of, as auto parts tend to remain in demand during weak economies."", 'When you think about it, that makes a ton of sense. Cars are an expensive purchase. Often, people face a choice between repairing their old car or purchasing a newer-to-them car. When times are tough, folks are more likely to shell out a bit of money to fix their existing car, rather than shell out a whole bunch more money to buy a newer one.', ""The ability to do well in tough times is key to Genuine Parts' impressive 68-year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases. The company's 5% dividend hike puts its payment at $1 per share per quarter, giving it a solid yield around 2.6%."", ""Its dividend consumes only around 41% of the company's earnings. That gives it room to continue its streak of increases, particularly if its operations continue to grow. With analysts expecting its earnings to rise by around 7% annualized over the next five years, Genuine Parts could very well soon find itself in rarefied company with a 70+ year streak of dividend increases."", ""McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is perhaps best known as a fast food burger flipper. Despite that reputation, savvy investors often think of it as a real estate mogul that happens to sell hamburgers."", ""From an investor's perspective, a key feature about real estate is that it often generates steady and predictable cash flows. That is a wonderful trait for a business to have if that company plans to pay its shareholders dividends."", ""Sure enough, McDonald's has been able to increase its dividend for 47 consecutive years, with its most recent increase clocking in at a substantial 10%. Often, when companies prioritize their dividend growth streak, their rate of increases will drop to help protect them against losing the streak due to a bad year."", ""That McDonald's is still able to deliver a double-digit increase after nearly a half-century of raises speaks volumes for its strategy. In addition to that potential for continued dividend growth, investors get a solid current yield of around 2.4%. Plus, with its dividend consuming a little more than half of its earnings, McDonald's has room to continue boosting its payout in line with its earnings growth over time."", ""Analysts expect McDonald's to be able to increase its earnings by almost 7% annualized over the next five years. That potential growth, combined with McDonald's long-term history of dividend increases and reasonable current payout ratio, gives good reason to believe it will keep its streak of hikes alive."", ""As awesome as both McDonald's and Genuine Parts' dividend histories and prospects may be, you'll only benefit from them if you own their shares over time. To get a dividend, you need to own a company's stock before its ex-dividend date and hold at least through that date. To really benefit from a rising dividend, you'll need to hold its shares throughout multiple annual increase cycles."", 'That long-term reality makes today a great day to consider an investment in one of these two dividend dynamos. While nothing is ever guaranteed in the market, their great combination of strong operations, long-term dividend growth trends, and solid prospects for the future make them certainly worth a second look.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Genuine Parts right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Genuine Parts, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Genuine Parts wasn’t one of them.

Cramer said he learned the concept of welcoming sell-offs from the legendary investor Peter Lynch, who famously said that you should expect a 10% pullback on average after every two years and a 25% “beatdown” every six years. Peter Lynch, Cramer reminded, said about 30 years ago that despite pullbacks and sell-offs the market tends to do well in the long term since according to his estimates corporate profits grow 8% per year.

Despite the blip, the commodity appears quite stable on the back of relatively bullish fundamentals and tensions in the oil-rich Middle East.We believe that oil’s current levels of just above $80 allow long-term-oriented market participants to buy shares in quality companies at attractive prices. Investors interested in the sector could benefit from having top-ranked stocks like Murphy USA MUSA, Sunoco LP SUN and Helmerich & Payne HP in their portfolios.Let\'s dig deep into EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Mar 22.', 'Crude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose 3.2 million barrels compared to analysts’ expectations of a 2-million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The surprise stockpile build with the world’s biggest oil consumer was largely thanks to higher imports, lower export shipments and continued high domestic production. These factors more than offset the rise in refinery demand.Total domestic stock now stands at 448.2 million barrels, 5.4% lower than the year-ago figure of 473.7 million barrels and 2% less than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 2.1 million barrels to 33.5 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover dropped from 29 days in the previous week to 28.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.9 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in eight weeks. The 1.3-million-barrel build was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand and exports. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would drop 1.7 million barrels. At 232.1 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 2.4% more than the year-earlier level, while it is 1% lower than the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) fell after a two-week climb. The 1.2-million-barrel drop mainly reflected an uptick in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of 300,000 barrels. Despite last week’s decrease, current inventories — at 117.3 million barrels — are 0.5% above the year-ago level but 6% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 88.7%, rose 0.9% from the prior week.', 'Having gone through the Weekly Petroleum Status Report, investors interested in the energy sector might consider operators like Murphy USA, Sunoco LP and Helmerich & Payne.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.2%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ', ""Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Based on the last payment, Colgate-Palmolive was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 51.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 47% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.36, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.9% over that duration. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately, Colgate-Palmolive's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year. Colgate-Palmolive is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either."", 'Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Colgate-Palmolive is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Now that investors are finished with the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence stocks, and are happy with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest supply and pricing details for the Blackwell artificial intelligence processors, they can now turn their focus back on what the Fed might or might not do later this year."", 'This macro trend can very well decide which stocks are hot or not. This is because high interest rates mean that high growth firms find it difficult to raise capital and the opportunity costs for investors to pile their money into speculative investments also go up. One of the strongest examples of this trend is stocks in the clean energy sector. Before the coronavirus pandemic, clean energy was one of the hottest sectors in the world with investors rushing in hand over fist. However, now that interest rates are high, clean energy stocks are in a bear market if we consider the 12-month performance of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The index of clean energy stocks is down by nearly 27% over the past twelve months, and it is one of the strongest examples of potentially hot stocks if the Federal Reserve changes its course of action on interest rates.', ""So much so that investors have discovered that by betting on clean energy stocks, they can end up 'playing' the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. What this means is that if markets decide that the Fed will cut interest rates, then stocks such as those in the clean energy sector will see their prices appreciate on the back of bullish bets such as easy money being available for financing pricey projects such as wind power plants and solar farms."", ""For hot stocks, which are typically seeing higher trading volume and volatility than other stocks, a timely investment decision can yield benefits. In fact, we don't have to look too far to see how this has played out on the market. One of the hottest stocks of 2023 has been NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer whose graphics processing unit (GPU) chips are at the forefront of the global shift to advanced data analysis and computing techniques collectively dubbed as artificial intelligence."", ""NVIDIA's shares are up by a stunning 627% since the last bottom of the semiconductor industry in the third quarter of 2022. Back then, the stock was trading for $120, meaning that the current trading price of $907 is beyond what most NVIDIA investors might have imagined would have been possible with their shares. Yet, even though NVIDIA's triple digit percentage share price appreciation does make it one of the hottest stocks of the past year or so, there are countless other examples of equities making similar jumps but in small time periods."", 'Two recent examples of such hot stocks are Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) and Elevation Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELEV). These are penny stocks that trade for roughly the same price ($4.34 - $4.64), and the stocks are up by 648% and 588% respectively, year to date. Unsurprisingly perhaps, both belong to the biotechnology sector, which is another area of the stock market that is highly sensitive to interest rates. The former is a biotechnology firm founded by professors from the illustrious Brown University, and the stock is up by 163% since Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) announced that its joint venture firm had made progress related to a Hepatitis B treatment. This treatment is particularly special, as according to the firm, it is the first human data from a genetically modified T-Cell vaccine.', ""The second hot stock, Elevation Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELEV), has also beaten NVIDIA's share price appreciation over the past year and a half, year to date in 2024. Elevation's shares popped in February end when it announced that its treatment that stops tumors from turning into cancer will now also include Japanese patients in its sample."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at what hot stocks are also finding favor among analysts. A couple of notable picks are Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACGL), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR)."", ""A fireworks display, reflecting the company's success in the global trading market."", 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the top hot stocks according to analysts, we ranked the 30 best performing stocks of the S&P 500 year to date by their average analyst share price target percentage upside.', 'For these best hot stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Devon Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.226. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

So that's top of mind for us, absolutely. And we use the generative AI service inside Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure so your data stays generally within OCI. And we will make sure that data is 1,000% secure because that's what our customers rely on us for."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, working with so many businesses, I mean you certainly have a good pulse on where things are right now. What's the sentiment right now in terms of investing in this technology?"", ""EVAN GOLDBERG: You know, again, I think we have companies from so many different industries. And if you talk to a software company, they are really cognizant of everything going on and they have great ideas about how they want to use AI. And we're going to bring more complex features to them."", ""But for your average small business, they're just worrying about how am I going to-- where am I going to make-- next sales are going to come from and how am I going to make payroll? And so for those companies, I think that's where the real promise of what Oracle and NetSuite are doing lies."", '- Evan, final question here, listen, you got-- you have plenty of rivals, right? Microsoft, SAP. How does what you announced today, Evan, how does it sort of you think differentiate and distinguish you from the competition?', ""EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah. Well, I mean, AI is data hungry. The best AI comes from the best data. And the way NetSuite works is it's one system. You really have a single source of truth and data about your business. And so I think that's really where our competitive advantage lies, is that the AI can consume information not just from one part of your business but from the entire business"", '- Evan, thanks so much for joining us today.

This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro."", ""Yet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public.

In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software.

That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, suggesting that Nvidia could remain a top AI growth play going forward."", ""The booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is turning out to be a solid tailwind for Micron Technology. That's because Nvidia's AI GPUs are powered by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) from the likes of Micron."", 'On its recent earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that Nvidia will be deploying its HBM chips in the H200 processors, which are set to be available to customers beginning in the second quarter. Micron management also added that it is ""making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.""', 'The demand for Micron\'s HBM chips is so strong that it has sold out its entire capacity for 2024. What\'s more, the memory specialist says that ""the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated,"" indicating that AI will continue to drive robust demand for Micron\'s chips.', 'Micron is also looking to push the envelope in the HBM market. The company has started sampling a new HBM chip with 50% higher memory, which will allow the likes of Nvidia to make more powerful AI chips going forward. As such, booming HBM demand will positively impact Micron\'s financials, with the company estimating that it will ""generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024.""', 'The HBM market is expected to generate almost $17 billion in revenue this year -- accounting for 20% of overall DRAM industry revenue -- as compared to $4.4 billion in 2023. Even better, it could keep getting bigger in the long run on the back of the fast-growing AI chip market. As a result, Micron should be able to sustain the impressive growth it has started clocking now.', ""The company's revenue in the recently reported fiscal second quarter of 2024 (which ended on Feb. 29) was up 57% year over year to $5.82 billion. The revenue guidance of $6.6 billion for the ongoing quarter would be a bigger jump of 76% from the year-ago period. So, Micron's aggressive AI-driven growth is just getting started."", ""Given the data above, Micron may turn out to be the better AI play compared to Nvidia because of one simple reason: At almost 37 times sales, Nvidia stock is way more expensive when compared to Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 6.4. Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned."", 'Of course, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Micron, and it could justify its expensive valuation by sustaining its terrific growth. However, investors looking for a cheaper way to play the AI boom are likely to consider Micron for their portfolios, considering its attractive valuation and the rapid growth it offers right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The stock rose over 14% in a single session thanks to outstanding growth in revenue and earnings. Micron's metrics crushed Wall Street expectations, and its guidance was strong enough to confirm the company's turnaround has finally arrived."", ""Over the past year, Micron stock is up 93%. Management's projections for future revenue growth (see below) suggest this stock might just have more upside left in the tank. Let's look at the numbers and see why investors should consider buying this chipmaker before its next set of elevated revenue projections reach their target dates."", 'In this most recent quarter, revenue shot up 58% year over year to $5.82 billion. That was well ahead of the $5.35 billion consensus estimate. Even better, Micron swung to an adjusted profit of $0.42 per share from a loss of $1.91 per share in the year-ago period. Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.25 per share last quarter.', 'A favorable supply-demand balance in the memory-chip market meant that prices headed higher last quarter, allowing Micron to significantly boost its margins. Management said that the prices of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) shot up in the high teens last quarter, while the price of NAND flash storage chips was up 30%.', ""All this explains why the company's adjusted gross margin increased to 20% in the previous quarter as compared to a negative 31.4% in the year-ago period. And an operating margin of 3.5% was a massive improvement compared to the negative 56% in the prior-year period."", 'CEO Sanjay Mehrotra credited the growing memory demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers as a key reason behind its turnaround. He said on the latest earnings conference call:', 'This improvement in market conditions was due to a confluence of factors, including strong [artificial intelligence (AI)] server demand, a healthier demand environment in most end markets, and supply reductions across the industry. AI server demand is driving rapid growth in HBM [high-bandwidth memory], DDR5 [D5] and data center SSDs, which is tightening leading-edge supply availability for DRAM and NAND.', 'Mehrotra expects memory prices to head higher as the year progresses and forecasts Micron will generate ""record revenue and much-improved profitability now in fiscal year 2025."" The company\'s outlook for the current quarter turned out to be well ahead of what analysts were expecting.', 'Micron expects fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue of $6.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.45 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range. Wall Street was looking for just $0.09 per share in earnings on revenue of $6 billion. Year over year, revenue is on track to increase by 76%, which would be a nice improvement over the growth the company posted last quarter.', ""Micron recorded a loss of $1.19 per share in the same period last year, which means that the recovery in memory prices is all set to give its bottom line a big boost. This helps explain why analysts are raising their bottom-line growth expectations following Micron's latest report."", ""Micron stock trades at 6.4 times sales, lower than the U.S. technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7.3. According to consensus estimates, Micron could end the current fiscal year with $24.6 billion in revenue. That would be a 58% jump from last year. And it is expected to sustain an impressive growth rate next year as well."", 'Assuming Micron does hit $34 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 and maintains its current price-to-sales ratio, its market cap could jump to $217 billion. That would be a 67% jump from current levels. So investors are getting a good deal on Micron stock right now, making it a good idea to buy it before it soars further following its latest earnings report.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and an introduction to Klarman's investing history, then you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman. "", ""One of the more well known investment strategies on Wall Street, which has also seen some of the most professional investors attest to its success is value investing. When compared to today's high frequency trading and quantitative model based stock market trading environment, value investment is a classical approach that evaluates whether a firm's underlying fundamentals and business models can cause share price appreciation in the future."", ""Two of the most well known value investors of our time are Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of the Buapost Group. Buffett's Berkshire is one of the biggest investment holding companies in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that the combined value of its 13F investments as of December 2023 end was a whopping $347 billion. As part of our regular coverage of hedge fund investments, Insider Monkey also analyzed Berkshire's Q4 2023 investment portfolio as part of our coverage of Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 12 Stock Picks. You can take a look at the portfolio by clicking on the link, but the top three picks were American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:AAPL)."", 'Another follower of value investing is Seth Klarman. His hedge fund had $4.5 in Q4 2023 holdings, and some of the biggest positions were technology companies such as Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). So what is value investing? Well, the key principle of this strategy is determining the fair value of stock and comparing it with the market price through a metric called the margin of safety. The margin of safety is the difference between the fair value and the market price, and the greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels in betting their money on an equity.', ""Just like we have done with Buffett's investments, we also took a look at Klarman's value stock picks. The latest such coverage was 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman), and the top three stocks in this list were Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS). Since it's March 2024, it's important to see how well these stocks have performed over the past six months since they were disclosed by Baupost for Q3 2023. Well, the three stocks' share price performance over the past six months has been 27.73%, 27%, and 26%. Interestingly, all three of Klarman's top value stock picks in Q3 are up by 26% or 27%, despite the fact that these are relatively stable companies with few catchy products like NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPU."", ""Finally, before we head to our list of the high growth value stock picks of Seth Klarman, Warren Buffett's latest letter to Berkshire shareholders also features some hidden gems for value investing. In his letter, Buffett shares:"", 'Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school.', ""These seizures are the perfect opportunity for value investing since they can open up large differentials between the fair value and the market price. Buffett's long history of trading has also seen him capitalize on such seizures early in his career, with perhaps the most notable being his trifles with the shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at Seth Klarman's top high growth value stocks.

The revenue growth data was sourced from Morningstar Financial."", 'For these high growth value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

Not only can they give you a continuing source of cash to reinvest, but they also serve as powerful tools to align a company's management's priorities with its shareholders'."", ""This alignment comes because many companies offer their leadership some form of stock-based compensation. Thanks to a solid, supported, and generally rising dividend, that leadership has an incentive to hold on to the company's stock for the long haul. After all, the dividend can continue to reward them for their efforts long after they're done directly working for the company."", ""With that in mind, smart investors looking for dividends don't just focus on the company's current yield, but also on factors that show a commitment to maintaining and boosting that dividend over time. These two dividend stocks look like they fit that bill well enough to be worth considering as potential investments to double up on right now."", ""Genuine Parts (NYSE: GPC) is perhaps best known as the company behind the NAPA Auto Parts chain. That's a particularly useful economic niche to be a part of, as auto parts tend to remain in demand during weak economies."", 'When you think about it, that makes a ton of sense. Cars are an expensive purchase. Often, people face a choice between repairing their old car or purchasing a newer-to-them car. When times are tough, folks are more likely to shell out a bit of money to fix their existing car, rather than shell out a whole bunch more money to buy a newer one.', ""The ability to do well in tough times is key to Genuine Parts' impressive 68-year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases. The company's 5% dividend hike puts its payment at $1 per share per quarter, giving it a solid yield around 2.6%."", ""Its dividend consumes only around 41% of the company's earnings. That gives it room to continue its streak of increases, particularly if its operations continue to grow. With analysts expecting its earnings to rise by around 7% annualized over the next five years, Genuine Parts could very well soon find itself in rarefied company with a 70+ year streak of dividend increases."", ""McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is perhaps best known as a fast food burger flipper. Despite that reputation, savvy investors often think of it as a real estate mogul that happens to sell hamburgers."", ""From an investor's perspective, a key feature about real estate is that it often generates steady and predictable cash flows. That is a wonderful trait for a business to have if that company plans to pay its shareholders dividends."", ""Sure enough, McDonald's has been able to increase its dividend for 47 consecutive years, with its most recent increase clocking in at a substantial 10%. Often, when companies prioritize their dividend growth streak, their rate of increases will drop to help protect them against losing the streak due to a bad year."", ""That McDonald's is still able to deliver a double-digit increase after nearly a half-century of raises speaks volumes for its strategy. In addition to that potential for continued dividend growth, investors get a solid current yield of around 2.4%. Plus, with its dividend consuming a little more than half of its earnings, McDonald's has room to continue boosting its payout in line with its earnings growth over time."", ""Analysts expect McDonald's to be able to increase its earnings by almost 7% annualized over the next five years. That potential growth, combined with McDonald's long-term history of dividend increases and reasonable current payout ratio, gives good reason to believe it will keep its streak of hikes alive."", ""As awesome as both McDonald's and Genuine Parts' dividend histories and prospects may be, you'll only benefit from them if you own their shares over time. To get a dividend, you need to own a company's stock before its ex-dividend date and hold at least through that date. To really benefit from a rising dividend, you'll need to hold its shares throughout multiple annual increase cycles."", 'That long-term reality makes today a great day to consider an investment in one of these two dividend dynamos. While nothing is ever guaranteed in the market, their great combination of strong operations, long-term dividend growth trends, and solid prospects for the future make them certainly worth a second look.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Genuine Parts right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Genuine Parts, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Genuine Parts wasn’t one of them.

After over 40 years of making waves on Wall Street, the billionaire investor continues to rattle cages at various companies through direct investments and activist campaigns.', 'Born in 1936 as the only child of a teacher mother and a lawyer father, he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Philosophy. However, he dropped out of New York University while pursuing a medical degree. His career on Wall Street began in 1963 at Dreyfus, where he was a stockbroker, after which he became a trader in stock options at Patrick and Company.', 'It was in 1968 when Icahn made a bold move,\xa0borrowing $400,000 from his uncle and purchasing a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for his new brokerage company, Icahn and Company. Initially, Icahn was focused on risk arbitrage, whereby he would buy a stock in anticipation of a takeover to generate returns. Here, Icahn started polishing his activist skills by agitating and pushing for takeovers to profit from them.', 'His first foray into the activist world came in 1978 when he made a large investment in kitchen stove maker Tappan Company and used his holdings to push for a seat on the board. With his influence on the board, Icahn pushed for the sale of the company to AB Electrolux, for which he made $3 million.', 'In the summer of 1978, Icahn met Liba Trejbal, who would become the mother of his two children, Brett Icahn and Michelle Celia Icahn Nevin. The two would divorce in 1999 in a fierce standoff, with Icahn marrying his long-time assistant, Gail Golden, the same year.', ""Icahn rose to prominence in the 1980s' when he\xa0was called a corporate raider,\xa0a title he held until he became an activist investor. The legendary investor invested in Hammermill Paper, Simplicity Patterns, Marshall Fields,\xa0Dan River, and ACF Industries and agitated for management changes and strategic changes to unlock value."", ""In the 1990s, Icahn invested in American Real Estate Partners and converted the company into his investment vehicle, which transitioned into Icahn Enterprises. He founded Icahn Partners in 2004, becoming one of Wall Street's most feared activist hedge funds. The hedge fund primarily invests in companies that Icahn believes will appreciate in value on corporate and strategic changes. Consequently, the legendary investor used the hedge fund to initiate positions in companies and then pressure management to pursue strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value."", 'By the end of the 20th century, Icahn had risen to the realms to become one of the most feared and tracked activist investors.', 'At the start of the 21st century, Icahn set sights on entertainment-related ventures, investing in Hollywood video chains Time Warner and Netflix. When Netflix was trading near its 52-week low, Icahn bought 10% of the company, sending the shares soaring 14% in what has come to be known as\xa0Icahn Lift. As he exited his investments in the streaming giant in 2015, his investment had ballooned from $321 million to more than $1.9 billion.', 'He has also launched some of the most aggressive campaigns to unlock value in companies he believes are trading below their fair value. In 2013, the billionaire investor came out on top in the world of activism following successful campaigns against Apple and Dell. He ran 14 public activist campaigns after making eight new investments with an average\xa0size of $1.2 billion.', ""Apple will always remain one of Icahn's top activist campaigns as he convinced the company to increase its stock buybacks in 2015. After a successful meeting with Tim Cook, Apple agreed to a $150 billion buyback proposal."", 'While Icahn has always been at the forefront of putting pressure on company boards as a corporate raider and activist shareholder, in the recent past, he has tasted his own medicine. His Publicly traded company Icahn Enterprises was in the limelight in 2023 as short seller Hindenburg Research targeted it over claims the company was overvalued and operating a Ponzi-like economic scheme.', 'Carl Icahn of Icahn Capital', 'The short seller swiped at the Icahn Company, trading well above its net asset value compared to a similar financial services company run by William Ackman and Daniel S Loeb. In its accusations, Hindenburg Saud Icahn Enterprises was taking money from new investors\xa0to pay out dividends to old investors, an unsustainable model.', ""Amid the Icahn Enterprise controversy, Icahn remains one of the most revered investors on Wall Street.\xa0Investors always track his moves and investments in anticipation that the legendary investor would uncover shareholder value through activist campaigns. It's from the massive following and trust that the Icahn Lift acronym came into being, depicting the expected value investors expect to unlock when playing by the legendary investor playbook."", ""With a net worth of about $5.6 billion, Icahn's investment philosophy focuses on investing in stocks that people ignore. He also identifies stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios and book values and tries to unlock value by engaging the management. By engaging the manager, he also calls for splitting up the business or returning value through buybacks and dividends."", 'Our Methodology', ""While Icahn has made a name for himself by running some of the most successful activist campaigns, he is not immune to failure. Some of his campaigns have struggled to bear significant returns, resulting in substantial losses for the activist investor. After analyzing 13D filings, we have settled on losses incurred by Carl Icahn's top activist targets. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the losses incurred.

Should you add it to your portfolio?"", 'The financial services company owns one of the four large credit card processing networks in the U.S. The others, of course, are Visa, Mastercard, and Discover, although Discover is being acquired by Capital One.', ""But American Express is different from Visa and Mastercard because it runs a closed-loop model, which means that it acts as its own funding bank. The other networks partner with banks to fund credit card lending, which is why their credit cards are approved by their issuing banks. Under this model, Visa and Mastercard don't have much exposure to consumer debt -- they just take swipe fees on the transactions. The advantage for American Express is that as a bank, it has loads of cash deposits that it can use as funding, and that provide it with net interest income. In 2023, its net interest income rose by 33% and accounted for 22% of total revenue."", ""American Express has expanded during the past few years to offer a larger suite of financial services including savings accounts, checking accounts, and CDs, and it also has a robust small business segment. It's a lot more than just a credit card network."", ""The company has changed in other ways as well. It has embraced a new, younger clientele that's affluent and loves its unmatched perks and rewards program. This premium customer base\xa0is the foundation of its membership fee model. American Express charges annual fees for its cards, which feeds its bottom line, and its high-earning members are also high spenders. Card fees increased 20% year over year in 2023 and accounted for 12% of total revenue."", ""Millennial and Gen Z customers accounted for more than 60% of new consumer accounts globally last year, and 75% of new U.S. consumer platinum and gold accounts. American Express maintains high retention rates and best-in-class credit metrics, which isn't surprising given the affluent customer base it caters to. These customers will grow with American Express and drive its revenues higher."", ""Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri noted that the company has four differentiating features that are difficult for challengers to replicate: diverse revenue sources, which include the recurring membership fees; a focus on premium customers that drives spending, good credit, and loyalty; a growing partner base; and strong brand value. Together, those comprise its moat -- and a durable moat is one of Buffett's favorite characteristics in a company."", 'Despite the challenging economic climate last year, American Express delivered excellent results.

Putting that together, American Express brings in almost twice as much revenue as Visa."", ""In 2022, American Express management presented a new growth strategy and offered a long-term projection for annualized growth in revenue of at least 10%, and growth in earnings per share in the mid-teens percentages. It's already exceeding those goals, and it's setting itself up to keep winning. It has its finger on the pulse of its customers, and it's launching products and offering rewards that meet their needs.

The giant oil and gas company ranks as the fifth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio."", ""You'll need less than $160 to buy one share of Chevron at its current price. I think it would be money well invested."", ""Chevron's valuation is attractive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 12x. The company offers a juicy dividend yield of nearly 4.2%. It has also increased the dividend payout for 37 consecutive years."", ""Most importantly, though, Chevron's growth prospects look good. I think it's highly likely that oil prices will rise over the next few years. As oil prices go, so goes the company's share price. Chevron could also have a big opportunity with carbon capture if the technology lives up to its potential."", ""Lennar (NYSE: LEN) is one of the smallest Buffett holdings. Berkshire's stake in the homebuilder is currently valued at less than $23 million -- pocket change for the giant conglomerate. However, I think Lennar deserves serious consideration from investors right now."", ""It's cheap in a couple of ways. Depending on how Lennar's share price fluctuates, you could buy two shares for $300. The stock also trades at a low forward earnings multiple of 11.6x."", 'Lennar provides a great way to profit from the ongoing U.S. housing shortage. That shortage is real: A recent analysis by Realtor.com showed the gap between housing starts and household formations widened in 2023. As one of the largest homebuilders in the country, Lennar is well positioned to benefit as this housing gap narrows over the long term.', 'This stock could also have a catalyst over the near term. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve officials indicated that three interest-rate cuts could be coming in 2024. Lower interest rates should help bring mortgage rates down and potentially spur more housing starts -- which is great news for Lennar.', ""What stock has Buffett bought the most aggressively over the last couple of years? Aside from Berkshire Hathaway itself, the answer is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). This oil company is one spot behind Chevron as the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio."", ""Occidental is the most affordable of these three stocks with its share price hovering around $65. It's also valued reasonably, with shares trading at 17.5 times forward earnings."", ""CEO Vicki Hollub predicts an oil supply shortage by the end of 2025. If she's right, the company's stock should soar in the not-too-distant future. I'm not as confident as she is on the timing, but I suspect that the combination of sustained demand without enough new supply will lead to higher prices."", ""Occidental is betting heavily on direct air capture, a type of carbon capture that sucks carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 34,000%, including dividends paid, since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares have appreciated by more than 5,000,000%."", ""Buffett and his investment team have long relied on brand-name, time-tested, and well-managed businesses to deliver superior returns. But it's Buffett's preference for dividend stocks that might provide one of the biggest boosts to Berkshire's long-term outperformance."", ""According to a report issued last year by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have produced an average annual return of 9.18% over a half-century (1973-2022). This compares to a modest 3.95% average annual return for public companies that don't offer a payout."", ""Companies that regularly share a percentage of their earnings with their investors are almost always time-tested and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. This is why Berkshire Hathaway's $370 billion investment portfolio is packed with dozens of dividend stocks."", 'But diversification was never big with Buffett or his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger. Although the investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee is on pace to generate about $6 billion in annual dividend income, a whopping $4.36 billion in combined common- and preferred-stock dividends can be traced to just five companies.', ""Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding by market value ($38 billion), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is the Buffett's dividend breadwinner. The more than 1 billion shares of BofA Berkshire owns will yield almost $992 million in annual dividend income."", 'The reason Buffett has long favored financial stocks (especially banks) is because they benefit from disproportionately long periods of U.S. growth. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the U.S. economic cycle, they have all been short-lived since the end of World War II.', 'By comparison, there have been two expansions that surpassed the decade mark. Cyclical bank stocks like Bank of America are able to steadily increase their interest income and fee-generating loan portfolios as the U.S. economy expands.', ""The other well-defined lure for Bank of America is that it's the most interest-sensitive money-center bank in the United States. This is to say that its net-interest income will increase or decrease more with changes to the prevailing interest rate than with other big banks. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle during the past two years has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to Bank of America's bottom line."", ""The second-biggest dividend payer in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio might come as a bit of a surprise. Energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which doesn't have a particularly hefty yield, is on pace to provide more than $897 million in aggregate annual income this year."", ""Based on the roughly 248 million shares of Occidental common stock that Berkshire has acquired since the start of 2022, Buffett's company should collect more than $218 million in dividend income this year. But Berkshire also owns $8.49 billion in preferred stock in Occidental that yields 8% annually ($679.2 million a year). This was originally a $10 billion stake, but Occidental has since redeemed $1.51 billion of the issue."", ""The reason Occidental Petroleum is so attractive to Buffett and his crew likely is because it's more linked than other integrated oil and gas companies to the spot price of crude oil. It generates the bulk of its sales from its drilling operations."", 'More than three years of reduced capital investment from major energy companies during the pandemic has constrained global oil supply and provided a lift to the spot price of crude. If prices remain elevated, Occidental should enjoy an outsized benefit.', ""It's probably no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by market value ($154.7 billion), tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), is one of the biggest providers of dividend income. Even after Buffett and his aides pared down Berkshire's Apple stake by some 10 million shares during the fourth quarter, the nearly 905.6 million shares still held will generate about $869 million in annual dividend income."", 'The beauty of Apple stock has long been its exceptional branding, strong customer loyalty, and top-tier innovation. Though it remains the domestic leader in smartphone market share, much of the future growth is expected to come from its shift to services.', ""CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a steady push toward subscriptions, which should smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur just before major iPhone upgrade cycles, as well as keep customers loyal to Apple's ecosystem of products and services."", ""But if you ask Buffett, his favorite thing about Apple might be its market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it has repurchased almost $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only is this providing a boost to Apple's earnings per share, but it is also steadily increasing Berkshire Hathaway's ownership stake in the company without having to do a thing."", ""Oil stocks are historically known for their robust payouts. In addition to collecting over $897 million from Occidental Petroleum, Buffett's company should be on the receiving end of more than $822 million in annual payouts from Chevron (NYSE: CVX). The dividend hike Chevron announced in February marked the 37th consecutive year it has lifted its base annual payout."", ""Even though Chevron and Occidental are subject to the same macro forces, Chevron's outlook is a bit different than Occidental. That's because Chevron's revenue channels are skewed more toward its non-drilling assets, such as pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. These midstream and downstream assets produce highly predictable cash flow in virtually any economy."", 'Chevron also has what can be considered one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies. It closed out 2023 with a net debt ratio of just 7.3%. Given its storied history of generating positive cash flow from its operations, Chevron has the financial flexibility to make big acquisitions and return a lot of money to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.', 'The fifth dividend stock that -- along with Bank of America, Occidental, Apple, and Chevron -- is helping Warren Buffett and his team oversee the collection of $4.36 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is consumer staples titan Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).', ""Coca-Cola has been a continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway since 1988. Because the cost basis on the 400 million shares held by Berkshire is so low (about $3.2475 per share), Coke's $1.94-per-share annual payout equates to a nearly 60% yield on cost for Buffett's company."", ""What's made Coca-Cola stock such a wonderful investment for decades is its geographic diversity. It has operations in every country worldwide with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia. This means it's able to take advantage of faster organic growth in emerging markets, while still generating highly predictable operating cash flow in developed countries. It also has more than two dozen brands that generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales."", ""Top-shelf marketing is another reason Coca-Cola has been able to increase its annual dividend in each of the past 62 years. It's leaning on digital media channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor advertisements for younger audiences, and can rely on its well-known brand ambassadors and rich history to connect with more-mature consumers."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Norfolk Southern’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ', 'According to our valuation model, Norfolk Southern seems to be fairly priced at around 9.45% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Norfolk Southern today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $229.99, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Norfolk Southern’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 83% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Norfolk Southern. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NSC’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NSC, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you'd like to know more about Norfolk Southern as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:', '39% = US$11b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.39 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (18%) in the Beverage industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""Coca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.57. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

So why not begin with some stocks that are already owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway? He's got a penchant for finding and sticking with the market's less volatile long-term winners, after all. Here are three of his top holdings that would probably be good fits for your budding portfolio."", 'Shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) will never be considered ""high growth."" The beverage business just doesn\'t work that way. Even when the cola giant is doing well, its revenue growth barely outpaces inflation as the drinks market is pretty well saturated.', ""What Coca-Cola lacks in growth potential, however, it more than makes up for in consistency and reliability. Much of that consistency can be attributed do the company's product lineup. Coca-Cola isn't just its namesake cola. This is also the parent to Gold Peak tea, Costa coffee, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, Powerade sports drinks, and a bunch of other colas. It's always got something to sell to someone, and people will always want something to drink."", ""The Coca-Cola Company's reliability isn't just rooted in its diverse range of products, though. It's fiscally consistent too, largely because of the way its business model works. Contrary to what you might expect, Coca-Cola isn't doing much of its own bottling these days. It's punted that work to localized bottlers and distributors so it can focus on what it does best. And that's marketing and branding."", ""Coca-Cola's part in the bottling process is simply providing bottlers with concentrated flavor syrups -- a much easier product to manage that also offloads the riskier part of the business to the bottlers themselves. That's operating and input costs like water, manpower, equipment, etc."", ""Coca-Cola's side of the business is actually rather stable, which is how the company's been able to raise its dividend payout every year for the past 62 years. It's that dividend, by the way, that may be why Berkshire's been willing to sit on its stake in the beverage behemoth since late-2006."", ""If the idea of owning a bank stock in this environment has you worried, you're not crazy. Demand for most banking services is slowing down, while defaults and delinquencies are ramping up."", ""Take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. There's nothing happening to banks at this time that they haven't survived before. Just think back to 2008's subprime mortgage meltdown. For that matter, the dot-com crisis of 2000 wasn't terribly different in terms of banks' cyclical headaches either."", ""And that's the key. This is a cyclical headwind. The downside of the cycle will eventually run its course, if it hasn't already -- something Buffett knows."", ""Enter Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). It's the nation's second-biggest bank as measured by assets, and arguably the country's best-known as measured by name-recognition. This size and strength leave it well-positioned to bounce back whenever the headwinds finally stop blowing."", ""In the meantime, BofA is holding up better than you might expect. Although its fourth fiscal quarter's total charge-offs on soured loans reached just under $1.2 billion, that's still only a manageable 0.45% of its total loan portfolio (versus 0.26% a year earlier). The same quarter's adjusted return on its tangible common equity -- or ROTCE -- came in at a healthy 11.7% too, indicating the bank is effectively using and managing its balance sheet."", 'Things could be better, to be clear. But with shares still down 25% from their early-2022 peak, the worst-case scenario is already arguably priced in, and then some. Newcomers will be getting in while the trailing price-to-earnings ratio is a mere 12, and while the dividend yield is a respectable 2.6%.', ""Bank of America is Berkshire's second-biggest position, by the way. It's holding a little more than 1 million shares of the bank. This trade is currently worth around $38 billion."", ""Last but not least, consider taking Buffett's lead by stepping into a stake in oil giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX). In an era that's seemingly prioritizing a shift away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner renewable energy sources, this seems like a tough bet to make."", ""But the movement towards more environmentally friendly energy isn't nearly as far along as it appears to be on the surface. The United States Energy Information Administration reports that roughly one-third of the nation's energy needs are still met by petroleum alone. Natural gas -- a hydrocarbon business Chevron is also in -- meets another third of the nation's energy demand."", ""Renewables (in all forms) still only provide less than 15% of the nation's consumed power. This same basic breakdown applies all over the rest of the planet is well."", ""It's a problem simply because the total global demand for power is growing almost as quickly as renewable energy production facilities can be built. Standard & Poor's predicts that even as far down the road as 2050, petroleum will remain the world's single biggest source of energy. Renewables will be a close second, but natural gas should still be in a respectable third place at that point in time."", ""Connect the dots. It will be decades before the world can wean itself off of the use of oil and gas. There's lots of money to be made by Chevron between now and then, and even after then. This bullish backdrop won't stave off the volatility that's inherent with energy stocks, which are closely tethered to oil prices."", ""So buckle up if you're diving in. Between the company's long-term prospects and the stock's dividend yield of over 4%, however, this volatility will be worth it. Warren Buffett thinks so anyway. As of the latest look, Berkshire's sitting on nearly $20 billion worth of Chevron stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

But it's Buffett's preference for dividend stocks that might provide one of the biggest boosts to Berkshire's long-term outperformance."", ""According to a report issued last year by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have produced an average annual return of 9.18% over a half-century (1973-2022). This compares to a modest 3.95% average annual return for public companies that don't offer a payout."", ""Companies that regularly share a percentage of their earnings with their investors are almost always time-tested and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. This is why Berkshire Hathaway's $370 billion investment portfolio is packed with dozens of dividend stocks."", 'But diversification was never big with Buffett or his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger. Although the investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee is on pace to generate about $6 billion in annual dividend income, a whopping $4.36 billion in combined common- and preferred-stock dividends can be traced to just five companies.', ""Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding by market value ($38 billion), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is the Buffett's dividend breadwinner. The more than 1 billion shares of BofA Berkshire owns will yield almost $992 million in annual dividend income."", 'The reason Buffett has long favored financial stocks (especially banks) is because they benefit from disproportionately long periods of U.S. growth. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the U.S. economic cycle, they have all been short-lived since the end of World War II.', 'By comparison, there have been two expansions that surpassed the decade mark. Cyclical bank stocks like Bank of America are able to steadily increase their interest income and fee-generating loan portfolios as the U.S. economy expands.', ""The other well-defined lure for Bank of America is that it's the most interest-sensitive money-center bank in the United States. This is to say that its net-interest income will increase or decrease more with changes to the prevailing interest rate than with other big banks. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle during the past two years has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to Bank of America's bottom line."", ""The second-biggest dividend payer in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio might come as a bit of a surprise. Energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which doesn't have a particularly hefty yield, is on pace to provide more than $897 million in aggregate annual income this year."", ""Based on the roughly 248 million shares of Occidental common stock that Berkshire has acquired since the start of 2022, Buffett's company should collect more than $218 million in dividend income this year. But Berkshire also owns $8.49 billion in preferred stock in Occidental that yields 8% annually ($679.2 million a year). This was originally a $10 billion stake, but Occidental has since redeemed $1.51 billion of the issue."", ""The reason Occidental Petroleum is so attractive to Buffett and his crew likely is because it's more linked than other integrated oil and gas companies to the spot price of crude oil. It generates the bulk of its sales from its drilling operations."", 'More than three years of reduced capital investment from major energy companies during the pandemic has constrained global oil supply and provided a lift to the spot price of crude. If prices remain elevated, Occidental should enjoy an outsized benefit.', ""It's probably no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by market value ($154.7 billion), tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), is one of the biggest providers of dividend income. Even after Buffett and his aides pared down Berkshire's Apple stake by some 10 million shares during the fourth quarter, the nearly 905.6 million shares still held will generate about $869 million in annual dividend income."", 'The beauty of Apple stock has long been its exceptional branding, strong customer loyalty, and top-tier innovation. Though it remains the domestic leader in smartphone market share, much of the future growth is expected to come from its shift to services.', ""CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a steady push toward subscriptions, which should smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur just before major iPhone upgrade cycles, as well as keep customers loyal to Apple's ecosystem of products and services."", ""But if you ask Buffett, his favorite thing about Apple might be its market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it has repurchased almost $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only is this providing a boost to Apple's earnings per share, but it is also steadily increasing Berkshire Hathaway's ownership stake in the company without having to do a thing."", ""Oil stocks are historically known for their robust payouts. In addition to collecting over $897 million from Occidental Petroleum, Buffett's company should be on the receiving end of more than $822 million in annual payouts from Chevron (NYSE: CVX). The dividend hike Chevron announced in February marked the 37th consecutive year it has lifted its base annual payout."", ""Even though Chevron and Occidental are subject to the same macro forces, Chevron's outlook is a bit different than Occidental. That's because Chevron's revenue channels are skewed more toward its non-drilling assets, such as pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. These midstream and downstream assets produce highly predictable cash flow in virtually any economy."", 'Chevron also has what can be considered one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies. It closed out 2023 with a net debt ratio of just 7.3%. Given its storied history of generating positive cash flow from its operations, Chevron has the financial flexibility to make big acquisitions and return a lot of money to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.', 'The fifth dividend stock that -- along with Bank of America, Occidental, Apple, and Chevron -- is helping Warren Buffett and his team oversee the collection of $4.36 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is consumer staples titan Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).', ""Coca-Cola has been a continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway since 1988. Because the cost basis on the 400 million shares held by Berkshire is so low (about $3.2475 per share), Coke's $1.94-per-share annual payout equates to a nearly 60% yield on cost for Buffett's company."", ""What's made Coca-Cola stock such a wonderful investment for decades is its geographic diversity. It has operations in every country worldwide with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia. This means it's able to take advantage of faster organic growth in emerging markets, while still generating highly predictable operating cash flow in developed countries. It also has more than two dozen brands that generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales."", ""Top-shelf marketing is another reason Coca-Cola has been able to increase its annual dividend in each of the past 62 years.

In the year 2022, wind power emerged as a significant contributor to the US electricity grid. Across 42 states, utility-scale wind farms harnessed the power of the wind to generate a remarkable 10% of the nation's total electricity production."", 'This translates to a staggering 435 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) being generated from these sources, highlighting the growing role of wind energy in the US. Some of the states contribute more to wind power generation in the country than others. The five major states that produced the most wind energy in 2022 were Kansas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Texas, and Iowa. Together, they churned out a whopping 57% of the total wind electricity generation in the US. These are among the windiest states of the USA. They are located in the Central and Midwest Region, which is among the windiest places in North America. The high wind speed in these states has made them suitable for wind power generation.', 'However, there is still a lot more potential for wind power generation in the US.

Due to the potential, the US wind energy market is on a promising trajectory, with forecasts predicting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.87% between 2022 and 2027. Other factors fueling this growth include favorable government policies, reduced cost of wind energy, increased investment in the sector, and concerns for climatic change.', 'With several players competing for a share of the market, the market is characterized by moderate fragmentation.

If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the latest news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Hot Stocks to Invest in According to Wall Street Analysts. ', ""Just like in 2023 and 2022, the stock market of 2024 is focused on the Federal Reserve. Now that investors are finished with the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence stocks, and are happy with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest supply and pricing details for the Blackwell artificial intelligence processors, they can now turn their focus back on what the Fed might or might not do later this year."", 'This macro trend can very well decide which stocks are hot or not. This is because high interest rates mean that high growth firms find it difficult to raise capital and the opportunity costs for investors to pile their money into speculative investments also go up. One of the strongest examples of this trend is stocks in the clean energy sector. Before the coronavirus pandemic, clean energy was one of the hottest sectors in the world with investors rushing in hand over fist. However, now that interest rates are high, clean energy stocks are in a bear market if we consider the 12-month performance of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The index of clean energy stocks is down by nearly 27% over the past twelve months, and it is one of the strongest examples of potentially hot stocks if the Federal Reserve changes its course of action on interest rates.', ""So much so that investors have discovered that by betting on clean energy stocks, they can end up 'playing' the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. What this means is that if markets decide that the Fed will cut interest rates, then stocks such as those in the clean energy sector will see their prices appreciate on the back of bullish bets such as easy money being available for financing pricey projects such as wind power plants and solar farms."", ""For hot stocks, which are typically seeing higher trading volume and volatility than other stocks, a timely investment decision can yield benefits. In fact, we don't have to look too far to see how this has played out on the market. One of the hottest stocks of 2023 has been NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer whose graphics processing unit (GPU) chips are at the forefront of the global shift to advanced data analysis and computing techniques collectively dubbed as artificial intelligence."", ""NVIDIA's shares are up by a stunning 627% since the last bottom of the semiconductor industry in the third quarter of 2022. Back then, the stock was trading for $120, meaning that the current trading price of $907 is beyond what most NVIDIA investors might have imagined would have been possible with their shares. Yet, even though NVIDIA's triple digit percentage share price appreciation does make it one of the hottest stocks of the past year or so, there are countless other examples of equities making similar jumps but in small time periods."", 'Two recent examples of such hot stocks are Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) and Elevation Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELEV). These are penny stocks that trade for roughly the same price ($4.34 - $4.64), and the stocks are up by 648% and 588% respectively, year to date. Unsurprisingly perhaps, both belong to the biotechnology sector, which is another area of the stock market that is highly sensitive to interest rates. The former is a biotechnology firm founded by professors from the illustrious Brown University, and the stock is up by 163% since Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) announced that its joint venture firm had made progress related to a Hepatitis B treatment. This treatment is particularly special, as according to the firm, it is the first human data from a genetically modified T-Cell vaccine.', ""The second hot stock, Elevation Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELEV), has also beaten NVIDIA's share price appreciation over the past year and a half, year to date in 2024. Elevation's shares popped in February end when it announced that its treatment that stops tumors from turning into cancer will now also include Japanese patients in its sample."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at what hot stocks are also finding favor among analysts. A couple of notable picks are Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACGL), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR)."", ""A fireworks display, reflecting the company's success in the global trading market."", 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the top hot stocks according to analysts, we ranked the 30 best performing stocks of the S&P 500 year to date by their average analyst share price target percentage upside.', 'For these best hot stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment.

(NYSE:EL). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 15% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Estée Lauder Companies today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $180.60, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Estée Lauder Companies’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Estée Lauder Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in EL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

If you want to skip our overview of the global beauty industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Invest In. ', 'The global beauty industry sits right at the heart of the multi billion dollar media and entertainment sector. Newscasters, television show hosts, models, actors, and even politicians have to groom themselves in order to address hundreds of thousands of people daily. Therefore, the beauty industry, made up of global giants, sits right at the top of the stock market when it comes to valuation.', ""Don't believe us? Well, consider Insider Monkey's coverage of the 14 Biggest Beauty Companies In The World. At the top of the list are global beauty and cosmetics giants the likes of L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCF), The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). Combined, these three firms have a whopping market capitalization of $438 billion, a figure that underscores the significant money that stock market investors have piled into the shares of the global beauty giants."", 'When it comes to analyzing beauty stocks, they can broadly be categorized as consumer defensive firms. This is because personal health products, such as shampoos, deodorants, and soap - which are some of the most common beauty products in the world, are also essential items in the daily lives of millions of people.', ""The nature of the global beauty industry, particularly due to its proximity to media and entertainment, means that beauty stocks can simultaneously benefit from stable consumer markets and innovation. Modern day science has enabled firms such as the Italian Framesi and L'Oréal to provide innovative new products that use stem cells and fatty acids to help the human body battle against anti ageing and genetic effects."", ""Additionally, the beauty industry's requirement to ensure that it is up to date with all the latest trends younger generations, such as Gen Z, are following means that they are among some of the first adopters of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence. In fact, AI in beauty is one of the hottest trends in the world right now, with firms such as the Taiwanese Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) using artificial intelligence for skin analysis, grooming, and other beauty applications. Despite the fact that its shares are down by 73% since 2022, the company is busy updating its AI portfolio. March 2024 saw Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) significantly improve the image processing capabilities of its jewelry virtual try-on (VTO) software by allowing users to upload 3D images. This software had previously allowed jewelry brands to create VTO effects with 2D images and eliminate the need to use complex 3D files."", 'Apart from NYSE:PERF, there are several other beauty technology stocks that are at the edge of the industry and exposed to innovation at the same time. A couple of these are Oddity Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ODD), Elevai Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELAB), and Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR). Starting from Elevai, the firm is a high end technology company when it comes to skincare products. It claims to use ""ultra-small, nanoparticle compartments packed with growth factors"" called ""exosomes"" to try and replicate the skin\'s natural healing process and deliver a fresh and youthful look. Yet, the exosomes haven\'t impressed Wall Street, with the stock down 78% over the past twelve months even as Elevai Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELAB) saw some magic in January after it announced a global licensing deal for ethically sourced stem cells.', 'Out of the other two beauty stocks in our brief analysis of beauty technology, only Oddity Tech Ltc. (NASDAQ:ODD) is worth mentioning when talking about performance. This beauty stock is up 57% over the past six months, with the surge starting roughly a month after Bank of American Corporation (NYSE:BAC) upgraded the shares to Buy from Neutral and, at the same time, cut the share price target to $37 from $60. Oddity is another beauty stock that sits right at the heart of the intersection of the multi billion dollar industry with artificial intelligence.', ""It uses software to help people buy beauty products right from the comfort of their homes, and the current bullish surge in share prices came after the firm's financial report for the third quarter of 2023. The figures marked a strong 37% annual revenue and 231% adjusted net income growth, and Oddity Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ODD) topped this up in its succeeding financials which saw it reverse a year ago operating loss into income of $6.5 million."", 'So, seems like beauty stocks are dependent more on their underlying fundamentals, and if the product technology is able to generate market penetration and revenue then they will see investor interest.', ""As for the broader beauty industry and stocks, here's what Madison Investments had to say about The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

It’s too complex and subjective a job for any AI model, they said. Fast forward a few months, more and more investment experts and firms are deploying AI for stock picking. Bloomberg in February reported that Vanguard Group was using AI in several of its products that use quant investing techniques. Among the funds where Vanguard has deployed machine learning models include the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund, the Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. The Bloomberg report said that the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund and the Strategic Small-Cap Fund beat their benchmarks and outperformed industry peers last year.', 'Machine learning and algorithms have long been at play in the investing game for quant funds. But the generative AI boom is making the power of mathematical, AI-powered analysis available for everyone. Using AI in investing would no longer be limited to quant funds. Financial services company Mercer conducted a survey to find out the penetration of AI among investment managers across its Global Investment Manager Database. Nine out of 10 surveyed managers said they are already using or planning to use AI in their investment process. A whopping 54% of the investment managers said they are already using AI to assist their decision making, while 37% plan to use the technology in the near future.', 'Mercer said in its report that the investment managers it surveyed said that the use of AI would give a whopping $14 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.', 'Since generative AI and machine learning in investing is currently in its early stages, there are some challenges for investment managers who are trying to use the technology to their advantage. Data quality and data availability are among the biggest challenges these managers are facing.', 'But robots are not taking over the investing game (for now). Almost no one in the survey said they are completely outsourcing the investing-related decision-making to AI. They are using AI-powered models just for assistance, idea generation, data analysis and other important tasks in the investing process. Final decision-making still rests with humans. The report added:', '“Just a small minority of managers report fully automated statistical, ML and DL models, reinforcing AI and ML technologies as tools that support managers, rather than replacing the role of manager judgment and intervention. Among managers currently using AI, around one in 10 report full automation of statistical models (11%), ML (14%) and DL models (6%), while a third report infrequent monitoring of these processes (33%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Across all three areas, a significant proportion of current AI processes remain reliant on constant human intervention, reinforcing the role of AI and ML technologies as a supportive “tool” rather than a direct replacement of humans across the investment process.”', 'Methodology', 'This article is a performance evaluation of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year.

For that we reverted to our experiment with ChatGPT conducted in March 2023 where we asked ChatGPT to recommend some stocks that would make one rich over the next 10 years. We also consulted Finder.com’s experiment with AI in which researchers at the comparison website asked ChatGPT to create a “portfolio of stocks from high-quality businesses with criteria taken from the leading 10 funds it is competing against.” This portfolio was also created back in March 2023.\xa0 In this article we picked 14 stocks from these two ChatGPT-recommended portfolios with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Traditionally, the main defensive sectors in the market are healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. Over the past year, some financial professionals saw a trend of most investors avoiding defensive stocks, but this may come to an end in 2024, as John Mowrey, NFJ Investment Group\'s executive managing director and CIO, noted on CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on January 30:', '""You\'ve been paid to avoid some of the more defensive areas because of higher interest rates. So if you look at utilities, if you look at staples, if you look at healthcare, all of these higher-yielding areas have been hollowed out because you\'ve been paid to avoid them. Everyone\'s been chasing the Mag 7 and the AI trend and then they\'re clipping coupons in fixed income. That\'s created a real opportunity in the more defensive areas. So should you get a bumpier period in the market, I think you\'ll get paid to be in those areas. So I like some of the more defensive areas.""', 'Mowrey believes that investors would be well-served to start moving into defensive areas as they are offering more attractive valuations, healthy dividends, and dividend growth, the last of which is a strong barrier against inflation. Considering these factors, many believe that defensive stocks are among the best beginner stocks to buy at present.', 'Considering the above, major fund managers are gravitating towards defensive investments. For instance, on February 21, Thomas Taw, the BlackRock APAC iShares Investment Strategy Head, joined ""Bloomberg Markets: Asia"" to discuss his recent moves. Taw noted that he is now positioning ""more defensively in equity portfolios"" instead of pursuing higher valuation companies and that he is particularly looking into more ""dividend type of investing.""', ""Investments in defensive sectors have been driving growth exponentially. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s healthcare sector outlook report for 2024 noted that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic propelled venture capitalists and investors to provide financial backing to the healthcare sector, resulting in investments in healthcare startups reaching all-time highs in 2021. The focus on tech in healthcare has also resulted in investors committing significant capital to medical technologies. Additionally, Deloitte's 2024 outlook on the utilities sector noted that the US Inflation Reduction Act's one-year anniversary marked the moment when investments worth at least $122 billion in clean-energy generation projects were confirmed. Like healthcare, the utilities sector is also increasingly turning to technology in its operations and goals for electrification, with Deloitte stating that 2024 will see power and utilities companies turning to artificial intelligence and other digital solutions as they work to transform the grid."", ""Our discussion above highlights the key role that tech has been playing in recent times, not just in the markets but also in terms of contributing to the growth of other sectors. Tech's contributions till date have resulted in many financial professionals beginning to consider it as a defensive sector as well, making stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) good options for those looking to buy into some of the best beginner stocks. In our list below, we have highlighted several defensive stocks, including some of the best tech stocks and best consumer staples stocks to buy, among others."", 'A trader working diligently at her desk, evaluating stocks of multiple industries.', 'Our Methodology\xa0', ""To compile our list of the best beginner stocks to buy, we screened for stocks in defensive sectors such as healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, and technology.

Demand for electricity is growing and notably, load peaks are changing as well. As the country brings on more renewables and adjusts to greater demand later in the day due to increased use of electric heat pumps and electric car charging, reliable clean power is at a premium. Vistra is well positioned with diversified fuel sources including solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and battery power storage facilities, along with a marketing division to manage price volatility. The company will soon be closing its accretive acquisition of merchant power generator, Energy Harbor, and the deal will make Vistra the second largest carbon free, nuclear electricity provider behind Constellation Energy, another portfolio holding. Vistra CEO Jim Burke, leads a veteran utility management team that is committed to transitioning the company’s portfolio to a sustainable footprint by closing older fossil fuel plants and increasing the renewables portfolio. They have also been an important voice to advocate for changes that will accelerate the global transition to a clean, renewable energy future, while maintaining adequate near-term supply. Vistra has a strong balance sheet that allows the company to invest in innovation and operational improvements. Additionally, management is using excess cash flow to buy 40% of the outstanding shares over a five year period and they are more than half way through that process. Currently valued at 9 times earnings with a 17% free cash flow yield and a 2.3% dividend, the stock remains a full position.

', 'The global beauty industry sits right at the heart of the multi billion dollar media and entertainment sector. Newscasters, television show hosts, models, actors, and even politicians have to groom themselves in order to address hundreds of thousands of people daily. Therefore, the beauty industry, made up of global giants, sits right at the top of the stock market when it comes to valuation.', ""Don't believe us? Well, consider Insider Monkey's coverage of the 14 Biggest Beauty Companies In The World. At the top of the list are global beauty and cosmetics giants the likes of L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCF), The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). Combined, these three firms have a whopping market capitalization of $438 billion, a figure that underscores the significant money that stock market investors have piled into the shares of the global beauty giants."", 'When it comes to analyzing beauty stocks, they can broadly be categorized as consumer defensive firms. This is because personal health products, such as shampoos, deodorants, and soap - which are some of the most common beauty products in the world, are also essential items in the daily lives of millions of people.', ""The nature of the global beauty industry, particularly due to its proximity to media and entertainment, means that beauty stocks can simultaneously benefit from stable consumer markets and innovation. Modern day science has enabled firms such as the Italian Framesi and L'Oréal to provide innovative new products that use stem cells and fatty acids to help the human body battle against anti ageing and genetic effects."", ""Additionally, the beauty industry's requirement to ensure that it is up to date with all the latest trends younger generations, such as Gen Z, are following means that they are among some of the first adopters of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence. In fact, AI in beauty is one of the hottest trends in the world right now, with firms such as the Taiwanese Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) using artificial intelligence for skin analysis, grooming, and other beauty applications. Despite the fact that its shares are down by 73% since 2022, the company is busy updating its AI portfolio. March 2024 saw Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) significantly improve the image processing capabilities of its jewelry virtual try-on (VTO) software by allowing users to upload 3D images. This software had previously allowed jewelry brands to create VTO effects with 2D images and eliminate the need to use complex 3D files."", 'Apart from NYSE:PERF, there are several other beauty technology stocks that are at the edge of the industry and exposed to innovation at the same time. A couple of these are Oddity Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ODD), Elevai Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELAB), and Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR). Starting from Elevai, the firm is a high end technology company when it comes to skincare products. It claims to use ""ultra-small, nanoparticle compartments packed with growth factors"" called ""exosomes"" to try and replicate the skin\'s natural healing process and deliver a fresh and youthful look. Yet, the exosomes haven\'t impressed Wall Street, with the stock down 78% over the past twelve months even as Elevai Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELAB) saw some magic in January after it announced a global licensing deal for ethically sourced stem cells.', 'Out of the other two beauty stocks in our brief analysis of beauty technology, only Oddity Tech Ltc.

This beauty stock is up 57% over the past six months, with the surge starting roughly a month after Bank of American Corporation (NYSE:BAC) upgraded the shares to Buy from Neutral and, at the same time, cut the share price target to $37 from $60. Oddity is another beauty stock that sits right at the heart of the intersection of the multi billion dollar industry with artificial intelligence.', ""It uses software to help people buy beauty products right from the comfort of their homes, and the current bullish surge in share prices came after the firm's financial report for the third quarter of 2023.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

However, Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) has also been able to draw in female consumers through its marketing efforts, offering flavors such as Peach Vibe and Watermelon and a formula designed to boost the human body's metabolism. As a result, the company's customers are evenly split between males and females."", 'Why should this matter to investors? Because Celsius has been able to drive a whole new category of consumers to its energy drinks, which, in turn, is driving market share gains and exceptional revenue growth.', ""Let's check out why Celsius looks set to energize your portfolio."", ""Celsius' soaring popularity led the company to strike a distribution deal with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) in 2022, in which the soda and snack juggernaut also took an 8.5% stake in the energy drink maker. This was a transformative deal for Celsius, as PepsiCo took over its distribution in the U.S., helping to put Celsius' products into more stores."", ""While energy drinks are sold through grocery stores and mass merchant retailers, the convenience store channel is the biggest outlet for these products. Convenience stores tend to be more regional or local in nature, and with over 150,000 convenience stores in the U.S., getting into all these stores isn't easy. However, with PepsiCo having a huge presence in the channel with its soda and snack offerings, it has been able to get Celsius into most of these stores."", ""This is important because it puts Celsius energy drinks in front of consumers. Energy drinks are often spur-of-the-moment purchases, so if a consumer goes into a convenience store and doesn't find Celsius, there is a high likelihood they'll buy something else instead."", ""In the beverage industry, distribution is often measured by the percentage of all commodity volumes (ACV). This metric gives a sense of how well a product is being distributed in each particular market. The calculation is weighted by a retailer's sales, so a store selling $1 million a year in energy drinks is counted much more heavily than a store with only $1,000 in annual energy drink sales. At the end of 2023, Celsius' U.S. ACV was 98%, up from 44% in the convenience store channel at the end of 2021. This means that nearly every store that sells energy drinks now also carries Celsius."", ""In addition to helping Celsius get into more stores, the combination of a popular product and PepsiCo's distribution also allows the company to get additional cooler space as it introduces new products and flavors. The more products on the shelves, the more energy drinks the company can sell."", ""Given the company's success in the U.S., it is now starting to enter international markets as well. In January, it expanded its deal with PepsiCo for distribution into Canada. Meanwhile, it recently selected Suntory Beverage to be its distribution partner in the U.K., Ireland, and Northern Ireland, and Suntory Oceania to be its distribution partner in Australia and New Zealand."", ""In 2023, nearly 96% of Celsius' revenue came from North America. By comparison, 62% of Monster's 2023 revenue came from the U.S. This demonstrates the long runway of international growth that the company could have ahead of it."", ""Celsius' stock isn't necessarily cheap, trading at over 84 times forward P/E and a nearly 2 times PEG ratio. It does face competition from established players like Monster and Red Bull, along with upstarts like the female-focused Alani NU. So, there are risks."", 'However, while Celsius saw its revenue more than double last year to $1.3 billion, that is still small compared to the $7.1 billion in revenue that Monster generated in 2023.', 'With shelf space gains, new product and flavor introductions, and international expansion ahead, Celsius has a long growth runway. As such, the stock could be a long-term winner and help energize your portfolio.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

The CRLs — one for R/R FL and one for R/R DLBCL — did not identify any approvability issues with the clinical efficacy or safety, trial design, labeling or manufacturing of the candidate. REGN has been actively enrolling patients in multiple phase III trials for odronextamab as part of the OLYMPIA program. The program is expected to change the treatment paradigm of several B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes, including in earlier lines of therapy.', 'The FDA agreed to the OLYMPIA program and required that the trials include both dose-finding and confirmatory portions. While enrollment has already begun in the dose-finding portion of the studies, the CRLs indicate that the confirmatory portions of these trials should be underway currently.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi’s overall performance…” (Click here to see the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60', 'Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2', 'Cisco Systems, Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.', ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)."", 'Now, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.', ""So naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro."", ""Yet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public.

The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence."", ""Jensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion.
