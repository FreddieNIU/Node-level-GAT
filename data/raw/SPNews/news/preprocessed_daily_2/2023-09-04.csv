Tech stocks could also remain out of favor this month as high interest rates drive investors toward more conservative investments, while dividend stocks will remain unappealing as long as interest rates stay elevated. If you can tune out all of that near-term noise about the so-called ""September effect,"" adding Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to your portfolio could provide a great blend of long-term growth and reliable income.Continue reading]"

The dividend yield is 1.0% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources Range Resources' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, prior to this announcement, Range Resources' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 54.6% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 9.8%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.16 total annually to $0.32. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 7.2% over that duration. We have seen cuts in the past, so while the growth looks promising we would be a little bit cautious about its track record.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Range Resources has grown earnings per share at 96% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Range Resources Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Range Resources (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing.

This makes the dividend yield 4.0%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for State Street State Street's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, State Street has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 34%, which means that State Street would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 9.7% over the next 3 years. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 36% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendState Street Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.96 total annually to $2.76. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. State Street has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.0% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like State Street's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

3,da928c31-7084-385f-a9eb-a238bb6e6864,CTAS,2023-09-04,Late-Summer Steals: 7 Stocks to Buy Before Fall,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/summer-steals-7-stocks-buy-014817599.html,1693273697,STORY,"['TGT', 'ABBV', 'TSCO', 'ULTA', 'CTAS', 'RMD', 'HD', 'PAYC']","[With summer coming to an end, investors may want to target certain compelling stocks to buy now. Basically, the theory is the reverse of the adage, sell in May and go away. Those who did sell in May are now returning from their summer vacations and getting back to work. Further, with traders bidding up the hottest flavors of the week in the technology space, several opportunities exist that are simply overlooked – for now.With thousands of publicly traded companies listed on major U.S. exchanges, it’s practically impossible to keep track of all of them with the same care and attention. That just makes the stock picks below all the more enticing.Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comAn icon in the home improvement retail space, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a reliable everyday performer. However, it’s only up a bit over 2% since the Jan. opener. Likely, investors are focused on the hottest technology plays, thereby providing little attention to HD. Still, in the past six months, HD gained a hair over 9%. With shares down 2% in the trailing 30 days, this might be one of the stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinancially, you’re looking at a consistent growth and profitability machine. On the top line, Home Depot prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 15.2%, beating out 76.39% of its peers. Also during the same period, its EBITDA growth rate pops at 16.7%, above 65%. Lastly, the company runs a trailing-year operating margin of 14.88%, outflanking 87.67% of the competition.Notably, analysts peg HD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $342.48, implying a bit over 6% upside potential.Cintas (CTAS)Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Mason, Ohio, Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides a range of products and services to its enterprise-level clients. These include uniforms, mats, cleaning supplies, and safety products such as fire extinguishers and testing equipment. It’s a vital cog of the broader infrastructure and investors recognize this fact. Since the start of the year, CTAS gained more than 10% of its equity value.Story continuesStill, there could be more upside here, making CTAS one of the stocks to buy now. Financially, as with Home Depot above, it’s not a sexy business but it gets the job done with consistently solid sales growth and profitability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.8%, above nearly 64% of its peers. And it features an operating margin of 20.45%, above 85.45%.Significantly, analysts regard CTAS as one of the viable stock picks, pegging it as a moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target comes in at $531.08, implying 7% upside potential.Tractor Supply (TSCO)The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) storeSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.comFounded in 1938, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a retail chain that sells products for home improvement, agriculture, lawn/garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers. As well, the company serves pet owners and landowners. Naturally, Tractor Supply represents a critical partner for the future of U.S. agriculture. Therefore, it should make a great case for stocks to buy now.To be fair, since the start of the year, TSCO slipped more than 4%. However, this might be a temporary rough patch. For example, in the trailing one-year period, TSCO is up nearly 12%. More importantly, against a financial framework, Tractor Supply prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.3%, above 83.94% of its peers. In addition, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period clocks in at an impressive 26.8%. And it’s consistently profitable year in and year out. Lastly, analysts peg TSCO as a moderate buy. Their average price target hits $244.33, implying over 14% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comUnlike the other stock picks on this write-up, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in my opinion doesn’t have a sense of urgency per se. Don’t get me wrong: As a compelling and relevant pharmaceutical giant, ABBV makes sense no matter what. Plus, the company features a dividend yield of 3.98% per TipRanks, which is well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.5%.However, ABBV slipped almost 10% since the start of the year. In the past 365 days, shares gained under 8%, which seems overly pessimistic. With AbbVie acquiring Allergan (and thus the Botox unit), the pharmaceutical firm enjoys a gargantuan total addressable market.Basically, the looks-oriented (I don’t want to say superficial but I’m thinking it) demographics of Millennials and Generation Z will eventually get older. With no safe spaces protecting them from the aging process, Botox could be a powerful coping mechanism. Yeah, it’s awfully cynical but potentially viable. Anyways, I’m not sure if analysts agree but they peg ABBV as a moderate buy. With an implied growth of nearly 17%, it’s one of the stocks to buy now (if you want).Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefrontSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of beauty stores, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) just released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Per Barron’s, the company posted earnings per share of $6.02 on revenue of $2.53 billion. In contrast, analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipated the company to post EPS of $5.85 on sales of $2.5 billion. So, a top-and-bottom beat should make ULTA one of the top stock picks, right?Well, the market had other ideas. On the day of the disclosure, ULTA fell nearly 4%. And in the after-hours session, it gained just a tenth of a percent. What the flappity is all this? Honestly, I’m not sure if any analyst provided an explanation. Management noted – through data of course – that it’s essentially a recession-resistant business. Maybe investors are skeptical about that.For me, social normalization trends – particularly the return to the office – bode well for ULTA. In my view, it’s one of the stocks to buy now on the weakness. Overall, analysts view ULTA as a moderate buy. Their average price target of $532.89 implies nearly 31% growth.Paycom (PAYC)Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhoneSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWith the last two stock picks, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward profile, beginning with Paycom (NYSE:PAYC). Based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Paycom is an online payroll and human resource technology provider. Per its public profile, the company is one of the pioneering fully online payroll providers. It’s also one of the fastest-growing firms.Unfortunately, this status hasn’t impressed Wall Street this year. Since the Jan. opener, shares have been all over the map, presently down 6%. Over the past 365 days, PAYC slipped almost 21%. However, investors may be too pessimistic. For one thing, the company benefits from a strong balance sheet, especially its cash-to-debt ratio of 18.5x. Operationally, Paycom prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.2%, above 78.47% of its peers. And it’s consistently profitable with a net margin of 20.3%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts view PAYC as a strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $384.27, implying over 34% upside potential.ResMed (RMD)ResMed logo on a tablet on a yellow background. RMD stock.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, ResMed (NYSE:RMD) is a medical equipment company. Per its corporate profile, ResMed provides cloud-connectable medical devices for the treatment of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory conditions. However, investors are extremely skeptical about RMD. Since the beginning of the year, shares fell 23%.Granted, I understand the risky and often volatile nature of the medical equipment industry. At the same time, the global sleep apnea devices market may be worth about $5.8 billion this year. Further, experts project that the sector could hit $8 billion by 2028, representing a CAGR of 6.5%.Also, ResMed enjoys a solid growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate hit 12.2%, above 63.21% of its peers. Plus, it’s consistently profitable, leveraging a net margin of 21.25%. Looking to the Street, analysts peg RMD as a strong buy. Their average price target stands at $249.60, implying 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:XYL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-xylem-inc-102208386.html,1693822928,STORY,['XYL'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Xylem fair value estimate is US$114Current share price of US$103 suggests Xylem is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 4.4% lower than Xylem's analyst price target of US$119Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Xylem Is Xylem Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$790.6mUS$920.6mUS$1.04bUS$1.30bUS$1.46bUS$1.59bUS$1.70bUS$1.79bUS$1.87bUS$1.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 12.05%Est @ 9.08%Est @ 7.00%Est @ 5.55%Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$736US$797US$841US$974US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$979US$945(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.3bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$37bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$37b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$18bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$27b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$103, the company appears about fair value at a 10.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xylem as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.067. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for XylemStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Xylem, we've put together three relevant elements you should explore:Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Xylem that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does XYL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, speaking later on Ukrainian television, said Kyiv would not alter its stand, but would take note of Turkey's account of the Sochi talks. ""We should not continue to be hostages to Russian blackmail, where Russia creates problems and then invites everyone to solve them,"" Kuleba said.Story continues""It is clear that we will stand in defence of all principled positions, especially regarding sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation.""Standing beside Erdogan, Putin restated Russia's position that it could return to the deal but only if the West stopped restricting Russian agricultural exports from reaching global markets. A separate memorandum agreed with the United Nations calls for conditions to facilitate Russia's food and fertiliser exports.REVIVING THE GRAIN DEAL""We will be ready to consider the possibility of reviving the grain deal and I told Mr President about this again today - we will do this as soon as all the agreements on lifting restrictions on the export of Russian agricultural products are fully implemented,"" Putin said.He said Western claims that Russia had stoked a food crisis by suspending participation in the grain deal were incorrect as prices did not rise on its exit from the deal.""There is no physical shortage of food,"" Putin said.While Russian exports of food and fertilizer are not subject to Western sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Russia exported record amounts of wheat last year, Moscow and agricultural exporters say restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have hindered shipments.""The West continues to block the supply of grain and fertilisers from the Russian Federation to world markets,"" Putin said, adding that the West had ""cheated"" Russia over the deal because rich countries got more than 70% of the grain exported under the deal.Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's key agricultural producers, and major players in the wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed and sunflower oil markets.Putin said Russia expected a grain harvest of 130 million tonnes this year of which 60 million tonnes could be exported.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that he had sent Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""a set of concrete proposals"" aimed at reviving the deal.One of Moscow's main demands is for the Russian Agricultural Bank to be reconnected to the SWIFT international payments system. The EU cut it off in June 2022 as part of sweeping sanctions imposed in response to the invasion.Putin said that a plan to supply up to 1 million tonnes of Russian grain to Turkey at reduced prices for subsequent processing at Turkish plants and shipping to countries most in need was not an alternative to the grain deal.He also said Russia was close to a deal with six African countries over a plan to supply Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, the Central African Republic and Eritrea with up to 50,000 tonnes of grain each free of charge.

In the first half of 2023, S&amp;P 500 companies have repurchased $385 billion in stock despite paying over $3 billion in tax on the share repurchases due to the 1% tax that went into effect on Jan. 1.  Many companies feel share repurchases are an excellent capital allocation lever to pull. When a company announces a new share repurchase plan, its shares often rise on the news because it indicates management is enthusiastic about the stock’s appreciation potential. However, that is not always the case. In mid-August, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) announced a $15 billion share repurchase plan. Unfortunately, year-over-year declines in both sales and earnings sent HD stock lower in the days since. Barring any bad earnings news shortly, these three companies have initiated stock buybacks this summer that should send their stocks higher in the coming weeks and months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNVR (NVR)The logo for NVR is seen on the top of an office building.Source: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.comSince 2020, NVR (NYSE:NVR) has repurchased $3.6 billion of its stock. They are showing no sign of stopping now. The homebuilder recently announced that its board authorized a $500 million share repurchase. The company is one of three homebuilding stocks that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) bought in the second quarter, indicating that the holding company believes interest rates will soon fall, combined with an ongoing need for more housing in America.Through the first six months of 2023, NVR sold 11,034 homes at an average price of $454,000. As of June 30, it had a backlog of 12,286 homes at an average price of $458,600, which means it’s getting more for houses to be built than those already made in the year’s first half. Even though revenue and earnings were down through the first half of the year, they were still healthy at $4.52 billion and $748.4 million.   NVR stock is up nearly 33% year-to-date (YTD) and 130% over the past five years. The median analyst target price is $6,750, 11% higher than where it’s currently trading.Story continuesAmeriprise Financial (AMP)A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.Source: ShutterstockAmeriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) announced an additional $3.5 billion share repurchase at the end of July. The financial services company’s share repurchase program expires on Sept. 30, 2025. Including the $500 million still available, it has $4 billion on its stock buybacks authorization. The company also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35 a share. The May 2023 payment raised the quarterly dividend by 8.0% from $1.25. The annual rate of $5.40 yields 1.6%.    On the same day it announced its share repurchase addition, it released its Q2 2023 results. Its adjusted operating EPS in the second quarter was $7.44, 30% higher than a year earlier. Its operating earnings were higher due to a strong showing from its Advice &amp; Wealth Management segment, which grew adjusted operating net revenues by 14% over last year with a 49% increase in adjusted operating earnings. It paid out $146 million and $492 million in dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. AMP stock is up 8.25% YTD, about half the performance of the S&amp;P 500.

On June 30, the investment bank and wealth management firm announced that its board had authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program with no expiration.The dividend was raised 9.7% to 85 cents a share. The annual rate of $3.40 yields 4.1%. In the year’s first half, Morgan Stanley paid out $2.79 billion in dividends and $2.50 billion for share repurchases. Thanks to the swoon in its share price over the past six months, it’s down 12.5%, its share repurchases from the first half of the year are losing money. It paid an average of $90.29 a share on its buybacks, 8.5% more than its current share price. Analysts are generally enthusiastic about MS stock.

(NYSE:CRM) with 81% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-salesforce-120019216.html,1693828819,STORY,['CRM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Salesforce implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$216b in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 44% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Salesforce, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Salesforce already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Salesforce, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.7% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$6.5b worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Salesforce better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Salesforce  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 5 Biggest Generative AI Companies In The World.Generative AI is a powerful tool that has penetrated almost all industries and has found numerous useful applications. The remarkable capability of generative AI to create novel texts, codes, audio, images, digital art, and videos based on text prompts has sparked global interest. After the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the industry has been marked by a galvanizing plurality of generative AI companies and startups. The generative AI market is highly competitive, and companies are rolling out innovative features to stay ahead of each other.The Generative AI Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the generative artificial intelligence market was valued at $13 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $109.37 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.6%. North America dominated the generative AI market in 2022 accounting for 40.2% of total market revenue. The region is expected to grow consistently during the forecast period at a CAGR of 35.6%. The Asia Pacific region has been projected to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast period, with a CAGR of 36.5%. The generative AI market is divided into two main segments: software and services. The software segment is the most dominant and contributed 64.8% to the total revenue share in 2022. Tech giants like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the major players in the generative AI market.Generative AI is impacting almost all industries including gaming, healthcare, media, and entertainment. According to estimates by McKinsey, generative AI could add $200 billion to $340 billion annually in the banking industry and $400 billion to $660 billion annually in the retail and consumer packaged goods industry. Story continuesGartner has estimated that 30% of all outbound messages by large organizations would be generated by AI by 2025, compared to only 2% in 2022. The increasing use of AI in business could prompt the appointment of chief AI officers in 35% of large organizations by 2025. The proliferation of generative AI indicates the profound impact this new technology is bound to have on enterprises. The most evident influence is on enterprise productivity. Generative AI For Productivity Research done on customer service workers at a Fortune 500 software firm concluded that using generative AI tools enhanced productivity by 14% on average. The least skilled workers benefited the most as they completed their work 35% faster. Generative AI companies have started developing features, especially for businesses. Using generative AI could add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is investing heavily in generative AI startups and is the most influential investor in OpenAI. On July 18, according to an article by the Financial Times, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced Copilot, a generative AI feature for its productivity software particularly for enterprises. The company is charging $30 per user. The generative AI feature is meant to add value and enhance enterprise productivity. The AI assistant would be integrated into Microsoft 365 enabling users to access generative AI to perform functions like summarizing daily emails and tasks. According to McKinsey, AI has the potential to absorb up to 70% of employees' time by automation. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also working on generative AI and has a chatbot, Bard, similar to ChatGPT. The company is currently rolling out a generative AI feature to its search tool. This feature can summarize search results and show text and visual results based on prompts. On August 29, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced artificial intelligence tools specifically made for businesses. Enterprises can access these tools at $30 per month for each user. Duet AI in Workspace, one of the new tools introduced, allows users to utilize generative AI in Gmail, Slides, and Docs.Generative AI enables the user to communicate with machines in natural language. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released a generative AI model capable of writing code, Code Llama, on August 24. The platform can generate code from scratch based on text prompts. It can also be used to debug code. Code Llama could greatly enhance productivity by reducing the time required to write code. Code Llama by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) supports all main programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. This tool was launched in competition with the previously available Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) code-writing tool, GitHub Copilot, launched in January. On June 13, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) CEO Bill McDermott appeared in an interview for CNBC and commented on how artificial intelligence could dramatically increase productivity. He also briefly mentioned how the introduction of AI would influence jobs overall:""I think you will see jobs perhaps move from one part of the enterprise to another but giving people in the enterprise personalized, relevant and contextual self-service with accurate human language responses to general questions is a game changer. And what I think people are underestimating for enterprise AI is how this intelligent conversational experience will improve productivity at a dramatic rate. So, we can move from just cost out to productivity and growth on and I think that's really what folks are trying to do. I am not interested in taking jobs out of enterprises (using AI) but I am interested in improving productivity dramatically and helping CEO's reinvent their business models so they could grow again and that's really what this is all.""The world is going through a digital revolution.

""We are hearing more 'normalized promotional levels.' Comparatively, it may not look that bad, even though it still will feel somewhat promotional.""Barbecue grills are offered for sale at a Home Depot store on March 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)Groceries are driving consumers' purchasing decisions this weekendWhile featured deals vary from appliances to apparel to toys (with Walmart even offering a 10-foot kids' trampoline for a fraction of the cost), customers are looking to keep their purchases simple, starting with groceries at the top of the list.A recent survey of 518 individuals from Numerator found that over two-thirds of respondents (69%) plan to visit a grocery store to purchase items for Labor Day.This comes as the cost of food at home — what consumers see at their local supermarkets such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and others — increased slightly in July after remaining mostly flat in recent months.Story continuesOver a third of respondents plan to go to mass retailers like Walmart and Target too. Target seems to be playing into the grocery demand. At the top of its deal page, it features savings on its private-label ground beef and cans of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, among other barbecue fan favorites.Other consumers may be bulking up ahead of back-to-school at Sam's Club or Costco (COST), though Costco will be closed on the actual holiday. Overall, consumers aren't planning to do much Labor Day shopping online. Only 7% plan to go to online-only stores such as Amazon (AMZN) or eBay (EBAY) to shop this weekend.Feldman also said consumers are known to shop around holiday events like Mother's Day and July Fourth weekend.He even added: ""Halloween is off to a good start."" (Yes, its only the beginning of September, I know.)Consumers face squeeze from gas prices, credit card debtMeanwhile, in the background, the odds are stacked against consumers' wallets.Higher gas prices are ""still a pain point"" for consumers with the national average gas price at $3.81 per gallon as of Friday, AAA Northeast senior manager Robert Sinclair Jr. told Yahoo Finance.""I worry that with inflation cutting into the family budget, particularly for housing and food, that there isn't a lot left over for gasoline for ... non-essential travel,"" Sinclair said. ""Demand so far this year is 0.9% less than a year ago when gasoline was much more expensive. ... That's very, very telling.""In addition to higher prices at the pump, consumers' wallets are pinched by the cost of groceries, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments, and a rising rate of credit card delinquencies as Americans struggle to pay off credit card debt.Retailers are feeling the pinch in return. Earlier this month, Kohl's (KSS) CFO Jill Timm said ""payment rates [are] down, losses up"" — a potential red flag that consumers are falling behind.""Credit losses did increase over what was obviously a really low year last year,"" Timm added. ""But as anticipated ... we did take early actions as we did anticipate the macroeconomic environment to worsen and people to have less cash in their bank account.""Investors heard a similar message from Macy's (M).""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with investors. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Despite this noise, consumers continue to defy the odds.""The consumer seems to be somewhat resilient,"" Feldman said, especially when it comes to the desire to have the next big thing. ""The consumer is purchasing when they see newness, when they see innovation in the product.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This transition was portrayed as a mutual agreement between Brewer and the company. Brewer had assumed her role in March 2021, marking her brief tenure of less than three years. During her leadership, the company's stock experienced a decline of approximately 25%. However the stock has been in a secular decline since 2015, which long predates Brewers appointment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBA. Click here to check it out. WBA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WBAWalgreens takes a Hit!Challenges and Interim LeadershipWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) encountered numerous challenges during her tenure. These included navigating multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, adjusting pharmacy hours due to workforce shortages, and facing a reduction in the number of retail pharmacy locations. As an interim measure, Ginger Graham, a longstanding board member, has been appointed as the interim CEO. Walgreens will be searching for a new CEO to shepherd its turnaround.Strategic Investments under Brewer's LeadershipThroughout her short tenure with the company, Brewer emphasized the importance of prioritizing Walgreens' U.S. healthcare sector, recognizing it as a pivotal driver of future growth. Under Brewer's leadership, the company made strategic investments in this area to position itself effectively within the evolving healthcare industry. These initiatives included the $2.3 billion acquisition of Shields Health Solutions (specialty pharmacy care), a $5.2 billion investment in VillageMD (a primary care services provider), and a $3.5 billion investment to facilitate the acquisition of Summit Health, the parent company of an urgent care clinic chain.Slow Progress and Brewer's ExitWalgreens' foray into the healthcare sector was needed, the relatively slow progress on turning the base business around has been disappointing. It is likely that the company's board also lost confidence, leading to Brewer's exit.Story continuesWalgreens' Position in the US MarketWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) stands out as the second-largest retail pharmacy chain within the United States, (after CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS)) boasting an extensive network of more than 8,500 locations. Remarkably, nearly three-quarters of the American population reside within a mere five-mile radius of a Walgreens outlet. Approximately two-thirds of the company's revenue stems from prescription drug sales, solidifying Walgreens' position as a key contributor, accounting for 20% of the total prescription revenue in the United States. In addition to pharmaceutical sales, Walgreens diversifies its income sources through the sale of retail products in its front shop, encompassing general wellness consumables and their proprietary branded merchandise, along with revenue generated from European drug wholesale operations and the healthcare sector described above. The US retail pharmacy segment is by far the largest part of the business while the Healthcare segment is very new and as yet unprofitable.Walgreens takes a Hit!Competition and Profit Pressure in the US Pharmacy SegmentThe US pharmacy segment is facing intense competition not only from mail order pharmacies but profit pressure from Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) which are part of the Health Maintenance Organizations. The US has three large PBM's which are increasingly powerful and they control the margins they will allow the retail pharmacy chains. They have been putting the squeeze on Walgreens and other pharmacy chains reducing their operating margins and return on invested capital over time.Value-Added Services by Retail Pharmacy ChainsIn order to compete with mail order pharmacies and cope with pressures from PBMs, retail pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) are focusing on providing more value-added services. These services include:Medication adherence programs: These programs help patients stay on their medications by providing reminders, counseling, and other support.Patient education: Retail pharmacies are offering more patient education resources, such as educational materials, online courses, and pharmacist consultations.Telehealth services: Retail pharmacies are offering telehealth services, which allow patients to see a doctor or pharmacist remotely.In-store clinics: Retail pharmacies are opening in-store clinics that offer a variety of healthcare services, such as vaccinations, flu shots, diagnostic tests and basic medical exams. The value of pharmacies delivering Covid shots and tests during the pandemic was demonstrably obvious.Investment in Technology by Retail PharmaciesRetail pharmacies are also investing in technology to improve efficiency and customer service. This includes technologies such as:Automated dispensing machines: These machines can dispense medications more quickly and accurately than human pharmacists.Electronic prescribing: This technology allows doctors to send prescriptions directly to the pharmacy, eliminating the need for paper prescriptions.Patient portals: These portals allow patients to view their prescriptions, refill medications, and communicate with their pharmacists online.Future Trends in Retail PharmacyThe future of retail pharmacy is uncertain, but the industry is adapting and innovating in order to meet the changing needs of patients. By providing value-added services and investing in technology, retail pharmacies can remain competitive and continue to play a vital role in the healthcare system.Here are some additional trends that are likely to shape the future of retail pharmacy:The growing demand for personalized healthcare: Retail pharmacies will need to find ways to provide more personalized healthcare services to patients. This could include offering genetic testing, personalized medication regimens, and other services.The increasing use of digital technologies: Retail pharmacies will need to embrace digital technologies in order to improve efficiency and customer service. This could include using telemedicine, mobile apps, and other technologies.The rise of new healthcare delivery models: Retail pharmacies may need to partner with other healthcare providers, such as hospitals and doctor's offices, in order to deliver care more effectively. Again, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) has taken many steps to move into primary and acute care.Challenges and Opportunities in Retail PharmacyThe future of retail pharmacy is uncertain, but the industry is facing a number of challenges and opportunities. By adapting and innovating, retail pharmacies can remain competitive and continue to play a vital role in the healthcare system.The stock meanwhile fell sharply and is looking undervalued as shown in the valuation chart below.Walgreens takes a Hit!ConclusionIn my overall assessment, I believe the stock market's outlook on Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) is overly pessimistic regarding its future prospects. This anxiety is now exacerbated by the on-going leadership change.Walgreens operates in a defensive sector that is relatively protected from economic downturns and currently offers an appealing dividend yield of 8% though there is risk to that. Notably, Walgreens holds the prestigious title of a ""dividend aristocrat,"" having consistently distributed dividends for 47 consecutive years. Walgreens also operates a virtual duopoly in retail pharmacy in the US with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS).While it is improbable for the company to fully recapture its past heights due to a changing business landscape, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) is actively reshaping itself into a vertically integrated healthcare player. Remarkably, the company's stock is trading at an exceptionally low forward price-earnings ratio of approximately six. These modest expectations position the company favorably to deliver positive surprises as conditions normalize and Walgreens moves beyond the challenges posed by the Covid pandemic and opioid settlement issues.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Of course, if you’re younger, you have the luxury of time to take some risks. However, you also want to set aside some funds to build a solid nest egg.For this list, we’re going to concentrate on a combination of relevance and reliable passive income. To build an effective portfolio of retirement stocks to buy, you’ll probably need both components. In my opinion, each of the names below – some might raise eyebrows at first – stands a chance of being either permanently relevant or relevant for the next several decades.On that note, below are reliable retirement stocks to put on your watch list.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the concept of Kroger (NYSE:KR) ranking among the top retirement stocks to buy sells itself. No matter how advanced society becomes, you can bet on one thing: humans will need nourishment. Obviously, Kroger provides that with its business of grocery supermarkets. Also, it does so relatively cheaply.In other words, Kroger sits at or near the bottom rung of the trade-down effect. During times of financial struggle, consumers are likely to trade down from eating out at restaurants to staying at home and cooking. If so, many of the ingredients may come from Kroger.Regarding passive income, KR features a forward yield of 2.49%. That’s not that great, although it comes in above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. More importantly, the payout ratio sits at 25.75%, meaning that investors won’t have to worry as much about yield sustainability. Finally, analysts peg KR as a moderate buy with an average price target of $51.91, implying almost 12% upside potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s most recognizable healthcare firms, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) – following its spin-off of its consumer packaged goods unit – carries significant clout with its medical device and pharmaceutical businesses. As a result, I see J&amp;J as a permanently relevant idea for retirement stocks to buy. In particular, the aging baby boomer demographic along with the aging millennials should provide a constant stream of demand.Story continuesFinancially, I wouldn’t classify JNJ as anything truly remarkable. Rather, the main point is that it’s dependable. To that end, the company benefits from a relatively stable balance sheet and consistent profitability, backed by its trailing-year net margin of 13.35%.For passive income, J&amp;J carries a forward yield of 2.86%. While not the most generous yield, it’s above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, the payout ratio is very reasonable at 42.18%. Lastly, analysts peg JNJ as a moderate buy with a $182 price target, implying over 9% upside potential.Coca-Cola (KO)KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of iceSource: monticello / ShutterstockA soft drink powerhouse, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is as much a business as it is a symbol of American capitalism. To be fair, at first glance, KO might not seem an ideal play for retirement stocks. As the University of Southern California indicates, Millennials generally are more health-conscious than previous generations. Probably, the same can be said about Generation Z.Again, because Coca-Cola specializes in soft drinks, it might not appeal to relevant consumer demographics. However, the brand benefits from occupying the lower rungs of the trade-down effect. When people need their caffeine, during robust economic cycles, they may go to premium coffee shops. However, when times get tough, they may opt for Coca-Cola beverages.Another factor to consider is that the company offers a decent forward yield at 3.05%. And while the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 65.12%, Coca-Cola commands 62 years of consecutive dividend increases. Also, analysts love KO, pegging it a strong buy with an average price target of $71.82, implying 19% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comFor those who are “victims” of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), you might not want to hear about SRE being one of the retirement stocks to buy. As an electric and gas utility provider in the lucrative Southern California market, Sempra isn’t without controversy. For many years, the company has attracted criticism. It’s not surprising nor unique because the firm cynically benefits from a natural monopoly.Essentially, even if competitors targeted Sempra, they’d probably give up before launching a serious effort given the barriers to entry. However, this cynical framework is what makes SRE one of the top retirement stocks to buy. Combine that with a comparatively rich user base and Sempra is a permanently relevant entity. Despite the criticisms, it’s also generous, at least to shareholders with a 3.33% forward yield. Just as importantly, the payout ratio is quite reasonable at 49.79%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SRE as a moderate buy with an $84 price target, implying over 17% growth.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProposing hydrocarbon energy giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as one of the retirement stocks to buy presents a key risk. Mainly, I may attract criticism that electric vehicles are the future of transportation. Therefore, Exxon Mobil and its ilk will be irrelevant. Plus, you have state initiatives that aim to prohibit the sale of new gasoline-powered cars. Over time, I’m confident that policymakers will view such efforts as foolish.That’s not to say that EVs will be relevant. They certainly have their place. However, getting everyone to transition to electric mobility will require an overhaul in energy infrastructure at minimum. Plus, with the length of charging times, the mass-scale transition will likely require groundbreaking technology improvements that may or may not materialize.Given the questions surrounding EV integration, I think you’ll do well with XOM, especially with its forward yield of 3.36%. Also, the payout ratio sits at 41.23%, making it difficult to ignore. Looking to the Street, analysts target XOM hitting $124.69, implying over 15% upside potential.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAt the risk of wearing out the patience of InvestorPlace readers, I’m going to mention IBM (NYSE:IBM) once again, this time for – you guessed it – retirement stocks to buy. If you’ve followed my work over the past several months, you know my game plan. Basically, I’m going to point out that IBM appears significantly undervalued for offering artificial intelligence while other tech firms are grossly overvalued for providing similar products.However, the fundamental criticism is that IBM has not been successful in its AI endeavors, particularly in the healthcare space. Still, just because IBM failed does not mean that the current flavors of the week will succeed. In addition, “Big Blue” deploys significant resources toward AI research. If digital intelligence is a marathon, IBM could be a top player.Also, don’t forget that while you’re waiting, the company provides a forward yield of 4.57%. Given the rate, I think a payout ratio of 65.88% is reasonable. However, it’s a risky contrarian play since analysts only view shares as a hold.Philip Morris (PM)Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockEasily one of the most controversial ideas for retirement stocks to buy, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) represents a big tobacco firm. As such, some investors may consider PM stock as bad juju. Further, market participants must also consider the seemingly poor fundamentals impacting Philip Morris. Essentially, global smoking prevalence has declined, thus impugning the company’s total addressable market.On that note, PM seems a ridiculous wager. However, while smoking rates have decreased, vaping rates apparently skyrocketed, based on the explosive mobility of the e-cigarette market. To be sure, Philip Morris must now contend with myriad small competitors. At the same time, smokers look for a certain “tightness” in their drags, an attribute that a cigarette company would likely be better able to duplicate.Also, the underlying passive income is very attractive at a forward yield of 5.34%. To be fair, the payout ratio is lofty at 73.98%. Still, Philip Morris enjoys credibility with 14 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, analysts peg PM as a unanimous strong buy with a $116.71 price target, implying nearly 23% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:PPG) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$152 and falling to the lows of US$131. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether PPG Industries' current trading price of US$142 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at PPG Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries Is PPG Industries Still Cheap?Good news, investors! PPG Industries is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $184.14, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because PPG Industries’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of PPG Industries look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. PPG Industries' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 55%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since PPG is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PPG for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy PPG. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you want to dive deeper into PPG Industries, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

GLOV seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID before fees and expenses.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.02%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 3.30% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 3.3% of GLOV's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has gained about 9.25% and was up about 11.22% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/04/2023), respectively. GLOV has traded between $34.82 and $42.10 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.76 and standard deviation of 15.50% for the trailing three-year period. With about 396 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $17.96 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $28.86 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other end of the spectrum, India has also been seeing heavy rainfall that's causing flood conditions.""The monsoon has become more erratic and unpredictable, bringing extreme rainfall on the one hand and sudden drought on the other,"" the World Bank said.In the current climate, it's been a lack of rainfall that's hurt the country's ability to produce sugar. India is the second largest country in terms of sugar exports. This year, the country exported 6.1 billion tons of sugar versus the 11.1 billion exported in the 2021-2022 season.""India is set to ban exports of sugar for the first time in seven years following a low-yield cane crop hurt by a lack of rain, Reuters reported Wednesday (August 23), adding to a list of crops that includes corn, sorghum and soybeans suffering amid the Earth's hottest summer on record,"" Forbes reported.Consumers have already been feeling the effects of high sugar prices this year. India's decreased supply will certainly have a global effect on sugar prices, which have risen over 25% year-to-date.""India's absence from the world market would be likely to increase benchmark prices in New York and London that are already trading around multi-year highs, triggering fears of further inflation on global food markets,"" Reuters reported.Reuters Graphics3 ETFs to ConsiderIf India's drought can provide a catalyst for prices to rice in sugar, corn, and soybean, Teucrim has three funds worth noting. They can be used for portfolio diversification in the long-term for investors or for traders, taking advantage of short-term price increases.For sugar exposure, consider the Teucrium Sugar ETF (CANE) — the only sugar ETF on the market. The fund essentially provides investors an easy way to gain exposure to the price of sugar futures.Story continuesFor corn prices exposure, consider the Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN). The fund tracks three futures contracts for corn traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.It includes 35% second to expire contracts, 30% third to expire contracts, and 35% December following the third to expire. The various contract exposures help the fund limit the negative effects of rolling contracts, especially during a market in contango.For traders looking for opportunities in soybeans, consider the Teucrium Soybean Fund (SOYB). SOYB can essentially provide similar exposure to what investors could obtain by trading in soybean futures contracts themselves.For more news, information, and analysis, visit the Commodities Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Amplify’s Christian Magoon on Purchase of ETFMG’s ETFsKnight Checks King: Court of Appeals Rules in Favor of GrayscaleMadison Investments’ New MAGG ETF Actively Targets an Array of Fixed Income SecuritiesAI Targeting Compliance – Including Advisor Communications – Is EvolvingAXS Investments Targets Mortgage REITS With RINCREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM &gt;]"

""This brings concern about lack of storage, logistics. The sector as a whole needs to continue investing in storage.""However, companies demand legal security in order to approve new investments and take risks.""(We need) a clear and predictable regulatory framework to make investments in infrastructure,"" he noted.Sousa denounced criticism of the Ferrograo project based on ""biased"" assumptions in relation to the railway that will move millions of tons as soon once it is built.""One cannot be against Ferrograo. It is an irresponsibility,"" he added.In June, Brazil's Supreme Courtupheldthe suspension, pending studies, of a government plan to reduce a forest conservation park in the Amazon to allow for the building of Ferrograo.The railway, which stretches almost 1,000 kilometer (620 miles) and is considered strategic to move soybeans and corn more efficiently to export markets, would reduce reliance on roads but also affect local communities in Brazilian states like Mato Grosso and Para.

If you want to skip our analysis of the global sugar market and its impact on the economies of the world's biggest sugar producers, read 8 Countries That Produce The Most Sugar. Brazil, India, and China lead the countries that produce the most sugar; these nations collectively make up 41% of the global production. If we talk about Brazil, its hold in the sugar industry is powered by expansive sugarcane fields and a favorable climate. However, a substantial portion of Brazil's sugarcane harvest is diverted to ethanol production due to government mandates and global biofuel demand. On the other end of the supply chain, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Cuba, and Malaysia are the Countries With The Highest Sugar Consumption.The white, refined sugar we see comes from either sugar cane or sugar beet, the two sugar crops whose growth determines a country's ability to produce processed sugar. Sugarcane is native to tropical regions in South Asia and is the world's largest crop in production, with over 1.966 billion tons produced in the previous crop year. Once cut, the cane stalks are crushed to extract the juice, which is then purified and crystallized to produce raw sugar.Intriguingly, sugar beet is a root crop that many don't presume is a source of sugar, but it very much is. Of the 20 countries that produce the most sugar, four heavily rely on sugar beet, namely the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and France, as the crop primarily grows in the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere. Sugarcane is also the most consumed crop in the world, as its global consumption reached 1.966 billion tons in the crop year 2021/2022. Explore 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to learn more about the most significant crops. Global Sugar Market OverviewAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sugar market is $46.4 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $59.1 billion by 2028. The market will grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028, owing to increasing demand for processed food and beverages. Story continuesThe food and beverage industry is a significant consumer of raw sugar and affects market trends to a great extent. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American youth consumes 143 calories from SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) daily, while the consumption is 145 calories for older people. If we talk about average sugar consumption (including beverages, refined sugar, etc.), American adults take 17 teaspoons of added sugar every day, which is 2-3 times higher than the recommended amount as per the American Heart Association. While refined sugar's raw calories are associated with obesity and other health issues, it's imperative for the beverage and processed food industry. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are two titans of the beverage industry. The global market presence, along with a massive demand for sugar to produce their flagship carbonated drinks, means the purchasing decisions of Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can significantly impact global sugar prices.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. As a major producer of sugar-sweetened beverages, the company's sugar procurement strategy and demand heavily influence global sugar prices and market trends. Likewise, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has multiple well-known brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, among many others. So naturally, the company is one of the largest purchasers of sugar in the world.Apart from the beverage industry, the confectionery industry also heavily relies on raw sugar. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the owner company of brands like Cadbury and Oreo, is a big stakeholder in the market. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported net revenues of $31.496 billion in 2022, 9.6% higher than a year before. It's the well-loved brands like Milka, Trident, and Cadbury that drive Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) 's high sugar use.The biofuel industry, specifically ethanol production, is another off-taker of raw sugar. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, channels a substantial portion of its sugarcane crop into ethanol production. As a result, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are stakeholders in the sugar market. The rising demand for biofuels could stimulate increased sugar production and potentially higher prices.Let's now list the top countries in sugar industry.20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar20 Countries That Produce the Most SugarOur Methodology We ranked the top 20 sugar producing countries according to their raw sugar yield in the crop year 2020/2021. Our source for this study was the Food and Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). After shortlisting the nations leading in sugar production, we downloaded their raw sugar output stats from the UN FAO database by selecting the indicators of 'production quantity in 2020', as these are the latest records available. Based on our findings, here are the 20 countries that produce the most sugar:20. UkraineAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.17 million metric tonsUkraine is a top player in the global sugar market, and beet sugar is the main type produced. The country was estimated to produce approximately 1.17 million metric tons of sugar in the 2020/2021 crop year. A large part of Ukraine's agricultural sector is devoted to sugar beet cultivation because of its fertile soil conditions and favorable climate. Major regions for sugar beet cultivation include Poltava, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytskyi. 19. IranAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.56 million metric tonsIran's sugar production primarily revolves around two crops: sugar beets and sugarcane. In 2020/21 crop year, the country produced over 1.56 million tonnes of sugar annually. Sugar beets are grown in the country's colder north, while sugarcane thrives in the hot and humid southern region. Sadly, Iran has been grappling with a water shortage that impacts sugar production. 18. ArgentinaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.80 million metric tonsArgentina is renowned for its fertile Pampas grassland and has a long history of harvesting sugarcane. As a result, it sits amongst countries that produce the most sugar, with annual production exceeding 1.8 million tonnes. The subtropical provinces of Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy are Argentina's main sugarcane cultivation areas, as they benefit from adequate rainfall and warmth. The Argentine sugar industry is heavily mechanized, focusing on producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative energy source.17. South AfricaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.10 million metric tonsSouth Africa's sugar industry is predominantly based in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. The country ranks amongst 20 countries that produce the most sugar, owing to its around 24,000 registered sugarcane growers. South Africa cultivates about 19-20 million tonnes of sugarcane annually, then processed in 14 mills nationwide. Sugar production provides employment opportunities and facilitates infrastructural development. 16. IndonesiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.123 million metric tonsIndonesia is one of the countries that produce the most sugar. It is also the fifth-largest sugar consumer in Asia; the country's sugar industry is centered in Java, where the climate favors sugarcane cultivation. However, regardless of its vast cultivation areas, Indonesia's sugar production is often insufficient to meet its domestic demand as there are inefficiencies in farming and processing. 15. PhilippinesAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.125 million metric tonsIn the Philippines, sugar production is a vital industry supporting over five million people directly or indirectly. The country produces an average of 2.12 million metric tons of sugar annually, catering mostly to domestic consumption. The Philippines' sugar industry also significantly contributes to bioethanol production, as the Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates a minimum bioethanol blend in gasoline. 14. ColombiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.21 million metric tonsColombia produces approximately 2.2 million tons of sugar per year, and sugarcane is a significant cash crop. Much of this output is used for domestic consumption, while a sizable portion is converted into ethanol for biofuel.13. GuatemalaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.65 million metric tonsGuatemala is one of the world's top sugar exporters, producing around 2.65 million tons of sugar annually. It's worth noting that the sector is heavily invested in modern technologies for irrigation, production, and energy co-generation from sugar cane waste.12. TurkeyAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.79 million metric tonsTurkey's sugar production is heavily based on sugar beet and has seen a shift due to governmental agricultural policies. Traditionally, state-run sugar factories dominated the industry, but liberalization since 2018 has allowed private enterprises to contribute significantly to the production. Turkey produced around 2.79 million tons of sugar during the last crop year, but its dependence on sugar imports to meet its domestic consumption needs signifies a production-demand gap. 11. EgyptAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.9 million metric tonsEgypt is among the top sugar-producing nations in Africa, as its annual production reaches almost 3 million tons. The sugar industry in Egypt has taken strides toward modernization and has invested significantly in upgrading machinery and refining processes. The government has also been working to ensure self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on imported sugar.10. FranceAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 3.8 million metric tonsFrance is one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe, particularly of sugar beets, as they are well-suited to its temperate climate. The country's annual sugar production is 3.8 million tons, owing to its sugar beet yield. France has high-yielding sugar beet varieties, and its efficient, modern sugar refineries make the most of this crop. France's sugar industry also takes a sustainable approach as many producers use beet pulp and molasses, byproducts of sugar production, to make biofuels and animal feed.9. AustraliaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 4.33 million metric tonsAustralia's Queensland and New South Wales areas boast a thriving sugar industry centered around sugar cane production. The nation produced over 4.33 million tons of raw sugar in 2020/2021 and became one of the largest sugar producing countries. Most Australian sugar farms are often located in coastal areas and make use of the tropical climate that is necessary for sugar cane growth. Click to continue reading 8 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar.Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Corn20 Countries That Produce the Most Wheat11 Best Sugar Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Thanks to a confluence of factors, the term ""sugarflation"" has become a thing.In particular, inclement weather has been a primary catalyst for lower supply, namely the emergence of El Niño. As such, global suppliers such as Asia and Brazil are unable to meet demand. Drought and other harsh weather conditions aren't conducive to growth.Nidhi Jain, an associate specialist at The Smart Cube, a research firm said, “The intensity of the dry season that El Niño is set to influence this year could result in a 10%–15% reduction in sugarcane yield globally.""As such, this could flow over into higher candy prices on October 31. Consumers continue to feel the pinch on sugar-related food items.""Your sweet tooth may have to pay a pretty penny to be satisfied,"" said Lisa Thompson, a savings expert for the Shopmium cashback app, in an Axios report.Major food companies are also dealing with soaring sugar prices. This might help with the bottom line, but is it sustainable in the long term?“Major sweets and snack makers Hershey and Mondelez, which produce brands including Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and Sour Patch Kids, are also dealing with high sugar prices, contributing to rising costs, executives said during company earnings calls in April,” a Wall Street Journal article noted.Trading the Higher TrendTraders who want to capitalize on rising sugar prices don't have to resort to futures exposure. Another option for easy ingress is the Teucrium Sugar ETF (CANE) — the only sugar ETF on the market.It seeks to have the daily changes in the NAV of shares reflect those in the sugar market for future delivery. A weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for No. 11 Sugar, traded on the ICE Futures US, measures this. The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal market conditions in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.Story continuesFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Commodities Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Is Now the Time to Look to Europe ETFs?Dimensional Aims for ETF Share Class RolloutNew Legislation Could Raise Pilot Retirement Age Amid A Record-Breaking Summer For AirlinesMarkets Seem Insane?

Using generative AI could add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is investing heavily in generative AI startups and is the most influential investor in OpenAI. On July 18, according to an article by the Financial Times, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced Copilot, a generative AI feature for its productivity software particularly for enterprises. The company is charging $30 per user. The generative AI feature is meant to add value and enhance enterprise productivity. The AI assistant would be integrated into Microsoft 365 enabling users to access generative AI to perform functions like summarizing daily emails and tasks. According to McKinsey, AI has the potential to absorb up to 70% of employees' time by automation. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also working on generative AI and has a chatbot, Bard, similar to ChatGPT. The company is currently rolling out a generative AI feature to its search tool. This feature can summarize search results and show text and visual results based on prompts. On August 29, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced artificial intelligence tools specifically made for businesses. Enterprises can access these tools at $30 per month for each user. Duet AI in Workspace, one of the new tools introduced, allows users to utilize generative AI in Gmail, Slides, and Docs.Generative AI enables the user to communicate with machines in natural language. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released a generative AI model capable of writing code, Code Llama, on August 24. The platform can generate code from scratch based on text prompts. It can also be used to debug code. Code Llama could greatly enhance productivity by reducing the time required to write code. Code Llama by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) supports all main programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. This tool was launched in competition with the previously available Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) code-writing tool, GitHub Copilot, launched in January. On June 13, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) CEO Bill McDermott appeared in an interview for CNBC and commented on how artificial intelligence could dramatically increase productivity. He also briefly mentioned how the introduction of AI would influence jobs overall:""I think you will see jobs perhaps move from one part of the enterprise to another but giving people in the enterprise personalized, relevant and contextual self-service with accurate human language responses to general questions is a game changer. And what I think people are underestimating for enterprise AI is how this intelligent conversational experience will improve productivity at a dramatic rate. So, we can move from just cost out to productivity and growth on and I think that's really what folks are trying to do. I am not interested in taking jobs out of enterprises (using AI) but I am interested in improving productivity dramatically and helping CEO's reinvent their business models so they could grow again and that's really what this is all.""The world is going through a digital revolution.

The winning bidder will lead the project to build the successor to the F/A-18, the fighter jet flown by Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick.The F/A-XX project is at a relatively early stage with no set budget. However, a lot of cash is likely to be on offer. The last big fighter programme, the US Air Force’s F-22, was estimated to cost $79bn.The hopefuls for the job are: Boeing, the maker of the war planes featured in the recent Tom Cruise blockbuster; Lockheed Martin, which makes the F-35s used by the Royal Navy on its Queen Elizabeth class of aircraft carrier; and Northrop Grumman, maker of the F-14 Tomcats flown in the original 1986 Top Gun, and the B-2 stealth bomber.The first generation US Navy FA-18s took flight in 1978 - TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP via Getty ImagesThe backdrop for the new contract is growing tension with China.While modern F-35s only recently entered service for the Navy, they are largely seen as an attack and strike craft rather than a plane that could stand up in a dogfight, says Rob Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners.Another drawback to the F-35 is it has just one engine, which means limited durability over the expanse of the Pacific. The F/A-18, nicknamed Super Hornet, has two, giving them a longer long-range.However, the F/A-18s are based on 1970s technology. The first generation of these jets took flight in 1978.“They want something that can be the equivalent to the Air Force’s F-22 for flying off a carrier. So if they have to assert air supremacy, they have a plane that could do that and the F-35 can drop bombs around it,” says Stallard.Boeing is seen as the front runner for the new jet contract thanks to its work on the modern Top Gun fighter.“It’s kind of theirs to lose,” says Stallard.One hiccup may be Boeing’s limited experience developing stealth fights, something the Navy will want to allow its planes to hide from enemy radar.Story continues“That’s something I think they will probably have to try and convince the Navy and Department of Defence on, that they’re as good as the other two, because the other two have decades of experience,” says Stallard.Competition to build the jets is a uniquely American phenomenon.Most European countries have just one manufacturer who can do the job: BAE Systems in the UK, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon; Saab in Sweden for the Gripen; and Dassault in France, which builds the Rafale.The US, with its huge defence budget, likes to keep three in work.“They do want some competition,” says Stallard. “You don’t want all your eggs in one basket. The smaller you shrink the defence industry, there is that chance that if you end up with group think and you don’t come up with these new innovative ideas.”There is plenty of work to go around. The US spent $877bn on defence last year, which was 39pc of total global expenditure, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.The F/A-XX is one of two current major fighter programmes in the US, the other being the US Air Force’s programme to replace its Lockheed-made F-22 Raptors. That project has been dubbed Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).Defence chiefs are likely to consider who needs the work when deciding which company to award the F/A-XX contract to.Northrop Grumman is developing the B-21 stealth bomber, which is scheduled to be in service by 2027. This means it has plenty to be getting on with for the time being, says Stallard.Meanwhile, Lockheed’s recent F-22 experience means it is a good candidate for the NGAD Air Force programme, although Boeing is still a contender for that project too.A question that will rear its head is why the Navy and Air Force in the US can’t merge the two projects and use the same jet for both, cutting costs.The US Air Force’s F-22 was estimated to cost $79bn - ED JONES/AFP via Getty ImagesOne clear reason why not to merge is political: the US Navy and Air Force each like to have their own hardware and have the budget to buy their own.However, the two planes will also be quite different, says Stallard.A carrier-based jet must be able to tolerate a harsher saltwater environment, as well as the jolt of rapid takeoff and landing on a carrier surface. For instance, while part of the same programme, the F-35A, used by the Air Force, and the F-35C, flown from carriers, are quite different in shape and capability.Range and the ability to stay in the air will also be key, says Robert Wall, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.“You’ve got to think about this all in the China context.; You would expect the aircraft to have range, probably quite a bit of it,” says Wall. “Especially if you think that your carriers are increasingly at risk from Chinese missiles.”Whichever company wins, there will be plenty of work to go around, says Stallard, because of the sheer complexity of modern fighter craft.“The emphasis is much more on the systems than on the plane itself,” he says.Modern fighter jets are more akin to a supercomputer than a machine gun with wings: drones and sensors will be feeding data to the pilot and back to base at all times.The technological shift is akin to moving from a classic Volkswagen to a Tesla, says Stallard.The winning bidder will likely need help adding cameras, radars, satellite radio equipment and processing power, as well as secure radio communication and an accompanying fleet of drones.This means a drone maker like Northrop Grumman could pick up plenty of work even if it does not lead on the F/A-XX contract.How many fighter jets will eventually be built and how big is the prize for the winning bidder? This is an open question.The F/A-XX contract is being tendered at a time when the Navy is spending huge amounts of money elsewhere. It is embarking on a $110bn submarine upgrade, replacing its Ohio class nuclear missile-carrying vessels with new Columbia class subs.Orders for Northrop Grumman’s nuclear bomb-carrying B-2s and Lockheed Martin F22s were both cut short after cost overruns. The F/A-XX could suffer the same fate if the winning bidder blows the budget.“I think everyone’s cognizant of the fact that if the costs go through the roof, the numbers will come down,” says Wall. “That said, there is a different threat perception now, people are worried about China, and they are worried about the numbers that China has.”Last week, the Pentagon announced a new drone programme called Replicator. The US will build thousands of these “small, smart, cheap” drones in response to hordes of Chinese drones, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks told a conference.The US is recognising that “numbers, to some extent, matter” says Wall.That could be very good news for whoever comes out on top in the dogfight to build the next Navy fighter jet.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

47,215b15dc-11de-32f2-a854-2b017b50bdcf,MDT,2023-09-04,Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.69,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-nyse-mdt-announced-dividend-101023111.html,1693822223,STORY,['MDT'],"[The board of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 13th of October, with investors receiving $0.69 per share. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.4%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic Medtronic's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 100% of what it was earning and 83% of cash flows. This indicates that the company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than reinvesting to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 59.3% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 69% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.historic-dividendMedtronic Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.04 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.76. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 3.1% per year. So the company has struggled to grow its EPS yet it's still paying out 100% of its earnings. Limited recent earnings growth and a high payout ratio makes it hard for us to envision strong future dividend growth, unless the company should have substantial pricing power or some form of competitive advantage.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Medtronic is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Currently, inflation sits at 3.2%, and many economists expect it may take some time for consumer prices to return to the Fed’s target level. All of this and more is making more and more Americans believe that a market crash is coming.It is likely that the Fed funds rate could remain in its current range of 5.25% to 5.50% (its highest level in 22 years) for considerably longer. Interest rates could also be ratcheted even higher in the coming months. What impact will this have on the stock market and economy? It’s difficult to say. Some prominent investors, such as Michael Burry of the “Big Short” fame are now betting on a market crash. Analysts and economists continue to debate whether the economy will orchestrate a soft landing, i.e. avoid a recession despite high interest rates. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, here are three solid stock picks for any eventuality. These are especially good buys if we do indeed get a soft landing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comHome improvement retailer Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reported decent second-quarter financial results and maintained its full-year guidance as its store traffic and sales continue to hold up in the current high interest rate environment. The company reported Q2 earnings per share (EPS) of $4.56 versus $4.49 that had been forecast on Wall Street. Revenue in the April through June period totaled $24.96 billion, which was slightly below the $24.99 billion that analysts had estimated.More impressively, Lowe’s maintained its full-year guidance, saying it continues to anticipate revenue between $87 billion and $89 billion, along with full-year EPS of $13.20 to $13.60. While the company acknowledged that consumer spending has softened heading into the summer months, it continues to see strong sales from contractors and construction companies. LOW stock has gained 12% so far this year and is up 105% through five years. Stockholders also get a quarterly dividend payment of $1.10 per share, for a yield of right around 2%.Story continuesMedtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedical device manufacturer Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) deserves more love from investors. The company just reported a classic beat and raise, lifting its profit forecast after posting better-than-expected financial results. The company based in Dublin, Ireland said its strong earnings are due to growing demand for its medical devices, particularly those used in heart and gastrointestinal procedures. Medtronic also said that it’s benefiting from a rise in non-urgent and elective surgeries that were put on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic.Medtronic’s revenue rose 4.5% to $7.70 billion, besting Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $7.57 billion. EPS came in at $1.20, which was better than the $1.11 that had been forecast by analysts. Sales of Medtronic’s heart devices, its biggest revenue driver, increased 5.5% to $2.85 billion. Looking ahead, Medtronic, which makes pacemakers, catheters, and other lifesaving medical devices, said it expects its full-year profit to be between $5.08 and $5.16 a share, up from a prior range of $5 to $5.10.Curiously, MDT stock is down 8% over the last 12 months, and has declined 15% over the past five years. Investors should see the decline as a buying opportunity, especially given the essential nature of the company’s products. Medtronic has also increased its dividend, which yields 3.36%, for more than 45 consecutive years. This is a soft landing stock you should buy during an anticipated market crash, for sure.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) wasn’t the only retailer to post strong results for Q2 of this year. U.S. department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) also put up strong numbers, beating Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company reported EPS of 26 cents a share versus 13 cents that had been forecast among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $5.13 billion compared to $5.09 billion that was anticipated. Macy’s maintained its earnings and sales forecasts for the remainder of this year. If there’s a market crash on the horizon, it doesn’t appear to be affecting Macy’s.The fashion retailer continues to expect EPS of $2.70 to $3.20 for all of 2023, and full-year revenue between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion. Macy’s also announced that both UnderArmour (NYSE:UAA) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) merchandise is returning to its store shelves in the current third quarter after being excluded for many years. This is a catalyst that should boost future sales. Despite the good news, M stock took a hit. It fell nearly 20% in the days after its Q2 print.The decline was partly due to a broader drop in all retail stocks, and on news that sales at its upscale department store chain Bloomingdale’s fell 2.6% in Q2. With M stock now down 40% on the year and offering an attractive quarterly dividend that yields 5.48%, this is definitely a stock to buy on the dip and hold onto should we get a market crash.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

49,cdaa996a-d469-3bcb-bcdf-c923fcde4aa4,MRK,2023-09-04,Possible Bearish Signals With Merck Insiders Disposing Stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-merck-insiders-130023173.html,1693746023,STORY,['MRK'],"[Many Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Merck The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MerckIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, sold US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$118 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$110. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, Merck insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Merck Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Merck. In total, insiders dumped US$948k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Merck Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Merck insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$186m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Merck Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Merck you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The winning bidder will lead the project to build the successor to the F/A-18, the fighter jet flown by Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick.The F/A-XX project is at a relatively early stage with no set budget. However, a lot of cash is likely to be on offer. The last big fighter programme, the US Air Force’s F-22, was estimated to cost $79bn.The hopefuls for the job are: Boeing, the maker of the war planes featured in the recent Tom Cruise blockbuster; Lockheed Martin, which makes the F-35s used by the Royal Navy on its Queen Elizabeth class of aircraft carrier; and Northrop Grumman, maker of the F-14 Tomcats flown in the original 1986 Top Gun, and the B-2 stealth bomber.The first generation US Navy FA-18s took flight in 1978 - TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP via Getty ImagesThe backdrop for the new contract is growing tension with China.While modern F-35s only recently entered service for the Navy, they are largely seen as an attack and strike craft rather than a plane that could stand up in a dogfight, says Rob Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners.Another drawback to the F-35 is it has just one engine, which means limited durability over the expanse of the Pacific. The F/A-18, nicknamed Super Hornet, has two, giving them a longer long-range.However, the F/A-18s are based on 1970s technology. The first generation of these jets took flight in 1978.“They want something that can be the equivalent to the Air Force’s F-22 for flying off a carrier. So if they have to assert air supremacy, they have a plane that could do that and the F-35 can drop bombs around it,” says Stallard.Boeing is seen as the front runner for the new jet contract thanks to its work on the modern Top Gun fighter.“It’s kind of theirs to lose,” says Stallard.One hiccup may be Boeing’s limited experience developing stealth fights, something the Navy will want to allow its planes to hide from enemy radar.Story continues“That’s something I think they will probably have to try and convince the Navy and Department of Defence on, that they’re as good as the other two, because the other two have decades of experience,” says Stallard.Competition to build the jets is a uniquely American phenomenon.Most European countries have just one manufacturer who can do the job: BAE Systems in the UK, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon; Saab in Sweden for the Gripen; and Dassault in France, which builds the Rafale.The US, with its huge defence budget, likes to keep three in work.“They do want some competition,” says Stallard. “You don’t want all your eggs in one basket. The smaller you shrink the defence industry, there is that chance that if you end up with group think and you don’t come up with these new innovative ideas.”There is plenty of work to go around. The US spent $877bn on defence last year, which was 39pc of total global expenditure, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.The F/A-XX is one of two current major fighter programmes in the US, the other being the US Air Force’s programme to replace its Lockheed-made F-22 Raptors. That project has been dubbed Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).Defence chiefs are likely to consider who needs the work when deciding which company to award the F/A-XX contract to.Northrop Grumman is developing the B-21 stealth bomber, which is scheduled to be in service by 2027. This means it has plenty to be getting on with for the time being, says Stallard.Meanwhile, Lockheed’s recent F-22 experience means it is a good candidate for the NGAD Air Force programme, although Boeing is still a contender for that project too.A question that will rear its head is why the Navy and Air Force in the US can’t merge the two projects and use the same jet for both, cutting costs.The US Air Force’s F-22 was estimated to cost $79bn - ED JONES/AFP via Getty ImagesOne clear reason why not to merge is political: the US Navy and Air Force each like to have their own hardware and have the budget to buy their own.However, the two planes will also be quite different, says Stallard.A carrier-based jet must be able to tolerate a harsher saltwater environment, as well as the jolt of rapid takeoff and landing on a carrier surface. For instance, while part of the same programme, the F-35A, used by the Air Force, and the F-35C, flown from carriers, are quite different in shape and capability.Range and the ability to stay in the air will also be key, says Robert Wall, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.“You’ve got to think about this all in the China context.; You would expect the aircraft to have range, probably quite a bit of it,” says Wall. “Especially if you think that your carriers are increasingly at risk from Chinese missiles.”Whichever company wins, there will be plenty of work to go around, says Stallard, because of the sheer complexity of modern fighter craft.“The emphasis is much more on the systems than on the plane itself,” he says.Modern fighter jets are more akin to a supercomputer than a machine gun with wings: drones and sensors will be feeding data to the pilot and back to base at all times.The technological shift is akin to moving from a classic Volkswagen to a Tesla, says Stallard.The winning bidder will likely need help adding cameras, radars, satellite radio equipment and processing power, as well as secure radio communication and an accompanying fleet of drones.This means a drone maker like Northrop Grumman could pick up plenty of work even if it does not lead on the F/A-XX contract.How many fighter jets will eventually be built and how big is the prize for the winning bidder? This is an open question.The F/A-XX contract is being tendered at a time when the Navy is spending huge amounts of money elsewhere. It is embarking on a $110bn submarine upgrade, replacing its Ohio class nuclear missile-carrying vessels with new Columbia class subs.Orders for Northrop Grumman’s nuclear bomb-carrying B-2s and Lockheed Martin F22s were both cut short after cost overruns. The F/A-XX could suffer the same fate if the winning bidder blows the budget.“I think everyone’s cognizant of the fact that if the costs go through the roof, the numbers will come down,” says Wall. “That said, there is a different threat perception now, people are worried about China, and they are worried about the numbers that China has.”Last week, the Pentagon announced a new drone programme called Replicator. The US will build thousands of these “small, smart, cheap” drones in response to hordes of Chinese drones, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks told a conference.The US is recognising that “numbers, to some extent, matter” says Wall.That could be very good news for whoever comes out on top in the dogfight to build the next Navy fighter jet.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Total assets reached $5.58 trillion, versus $5.56 trillion the previous week. It is the highest total since the data was first collected in 1992.This is not great news for banks that have been struggling to hold onto their depositors for the last year, especially since the failures of three sizable lenders in the spring.Since the beginning of January deposits at all US banks have fallen by $371 billion, according to data from the Federal Reserve, while money market funds have risen by more than $769 billion. Those outflows slowed during the summer, but deposits are still down for bigger banks since the end of June.The greatest flight risk is still from the wealthy. Deposits from wealth management and corporate accounts have both fallen nearly 13% so far this year through July, according to data provider Curinos, although both stabilized during the month of July. August data is not yet available.Mass-market consumer accounts, by comparison, have fallen just 1.8%.""Ironically, the most worrisome bank client is the very liquid high net worth client,"" Tim Coffey, a bank analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, told Yahoo Finance. ""The least concerning are the lower balance, lower income households.""The intense competition to keep these depositors is one of many challenges facing an industry roiled by high interest rates, rising funding costs, and eroding profitability.In recent weeks, Moody’s Investor Service and S&amp;P Global each downgraded credit ratings for a number of mid-sized lenders, meaning debt investors will now expect a bigger yield for holding their bonds.Story continuesLarger lenders also face new demands from regulators to set aside more capital and in some cases issue more long-term debt to absorb potential losses. Another concern is that rising credit card debt and delinquencies could lead to outsized losses in the near future.US bank stocks ended August with this year’s worst monthly performance since march, at the height of the industry's turmoil. The industry’s KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) tumbled 8% while the KBW Nasdaq Regional Bank Index (^KRX) fell 9%.'Flight risk'The pressure on the industry started in 2022 with the Fed's aggressive campaign to cool inflation with higher interest rates, which has in turn lowered the value of bonds held by many institutions and forced many institutions to pay more to attract or keep deposits.That, in turn, has lowered profits and heightened the risk of liquidity problems. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic failed in the spring largely because depositors pulled their funds in a mass exit.Silicon Valley Bank on the day it was seized by regulators in March. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Many depositors have ""shifted their funds into higher-interest-bearing accounts, increasing banks’ funding costs,"" S&amp;P said last month. ""The decline in deposits has squeezed liquidity for many banks while the value of their securities — which make up a large part of their liquidity — has fallen.""Deposits at FDIC-insured banks fell 2.5% in the first quarter of the year, the steepest quarterly drop since the regulator began collecting the data in 1984. The drop for uninsured deposits was much deeper; they fell 8.2% for the same period.“If you’re a bank and you’re not offering a competitive rate, there’s some flight risk,” Scott Siefers, a bank analyst for Piper Sandler, told Yahoo Finance.Bigger banks first benefitted from the chaos of the spring with deposit inflows as customers sought safety. But then they too started losing deposits to smaller banks offering higher rates or to money market funds. And wealthier customers proved difficult to keep.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and Citi (C) reported deposit outflows within their wealth management divisions during the second quarter. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo had 11% drops, far more than their total deposit outflows for the same period.A JPMorgan branch in Manhattan. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Andrew Kelly / reuters)In the middle of August, these four giant banks issued new short term CD ""specials"" in a bid to stay competitive on rates. JPMorgan Chase offered up to a 5% annualized yield for a 6-month CD.That increase will add to the pressure on smaller banks that might not be able to respond, said Ken Tumin, a senior analyst with LendingTree who tracks bank rates.""They're definitely being squeezed,"" Tumin added.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 5 Biggest Generative AI Companies In The World.Generative AI is a powerful tool that has penetrated almost all industries and has found numerous useful applications. The remarkable capability of generative AI to create novel texts, codes, audio, images, digital art, and videos based on text prompts has sparked global interest. After the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the industry has been marked by a galvanizing plurality of generative AI companies and startups. The generative AI market is highly competitive, and companies are rolling out innovative features to stay ahead of each other.The Generative AI Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the generative artificial intelligence market was valued at $13 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $109.37 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.6%. North America dominated the generative AI market in 2022 accounting for 40.2% of total market revenue. The region is expected to grow consistently during the forecast period at a CAGR of 35.6%. The Asia Pacific region has been projected to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast period, with a CAGR of 36.5%. The generative AI market is divided into two main segments: software and services. The software segment is the most dominant and contributed 64.8% to the total revenue share in 2022. Tech giants like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the major players in the generative AI market.Generative AI is impacting almost all industries including gaming, healthcare, media, and entertainment. According to estimates by McKinsey, generative AI could add $200 billion to $340 billion annually in the banking industry and $400 billion to $660 billion annually in the retail and consumer packaged goods industry. Story continuesGartner has estimated that 30% of all outbound messages by large organizations would be generated by AI by 2025, compared to only 2% in 2022. The increasing use of AI in business could prompt the appointment of chief AI officers in 35% of large organizations by 2025. The proliferation of generative AI indicates the profound impact this new technology is bound to have on enterprises. The most evident influence is on enterprise productivity. Generative AI For Productivity Research done on customer service workers at a Fortune 500 software firm concluded that using generative AI tools enhanced productivity by 14% on average. The least skilled workers benefited the most as they completed their work 35% faster. Generative AI companies have started developing features, especially for businesses. Using generative AI could add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is investing heavily in generative AI startups and is the most influential investor in OpenAI. On July 18, according to an article by the Financial Times, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced Copilot, a generative AI feature for its productivity software particularly for enterprises. The company is charging $30 per user. The generative AI feature is meant to add value and enhance enterprise productivity. The AI assistant would be integrated into Microsoft 365 enabling users to access generative AI to perform functions like summarizing daily emails and tasks. According to McKinsey, AI has the potential to absorb up to 70% of employees' time by automation. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also working on generative AI and has a chatbot, Bard, similar to ChatGPT. The company is currently rolling out a generative AI feature to its search tool. This feature can summarize search results and show text and visual results based on prompts. On August 29, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced artificial intelligence tools specifically made for businesses. Enterprises can access these tools at $30 per month for each user. Duet AI in Workspace, one of the new tools introduced, allows users to utilize generative AI in Gmail, Slides, and Docs.Generative AI enables the user to communicate with machines in natural language. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released a generative AI model capable of writing code, Code Llama, on August 24. The platform can generate code from scratch based on text prompts. It can also be used to debug code. Code Llama could greatly enhance productivity by reducing the time required to write code. Code Llama by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) supports all main programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. This tool was launched in competition with the previously available Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) code-writing tool, GitHub Copilot, launched in January. On June 13, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) CEO Bill McDermott appeared in an interview for CNBC and commented on how artificial intelligence could dramatically increase productivity. He also briefly mentioned how the introduction of AI would influence jobs overall:""I think you will see jobs perhaps move from one part of the enterprise to another but giving people in the enterprise personalized, relevant and contextual self-service with accurate human language responses to general questions is a game changer. And what I think people are underestimating for enterprise AI is how this intelligent conversational experience will improve productivity at a dramatic rate. So, we can move from just cost out to productivity and growth on and I think that's really what folks are trying to do. I am not interested in taking jobs out of enterprises (using AI) but I am interested in improving productivity dramatically and helping CEO's reinvent their business models so they could grow again and that's really what this is all.""The world is going through a digital revolution.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the oil refining industry, you can go directly to 5 States With The Largest Refining Capacity.Refineries play an important role in the global energy market and other related industries as well because they convert crude oil into a variety of products. The refining industry is also a major source of employment, and it contributes greatly to the global economy.Oil Refining Industry: Global Market AnalysisIn one of our previous articles about the largest refineries in the world, we briefly discussed that the oil and gas industry is facing increasing sustainability challenges. These challenges can include the need to comply with environmental regulations as well as transition to a low-carbon economy. Despite these challenges, demand for energy continues to grow and the refining industry is expected to remain an important part of the global energy market in the years to come.According to a report by Expert Market Research, the global oil refining market size reached a value of around $1.45 trillion in 2022. Looking forward, the industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% during 2023-2028, reaching $1.97 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Increasing population remains a major factor helping the expansion of the oil refining market as it has caused a surge in demand for fuels and other related products. Refineries produce high-value products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel for residential and commercial use as well as for other major industries including aviation and agriculture. While the oil and gas market is moderately fragmented, some of the major players in the market that are expected to benefit from rising demand are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), among others.On July 27, BBC reported that according to The International Energy Agency (IEA), peak oil use is in sight this decade as energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is taking place on a global scale. The report also states that concerns over climate change have grown and opinions around fossil fuel extraction have shifted enormously in recent years. In our article about the biggest companies in the world by revenue, we mentioned that with a five-year technology development program, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is looking to double the amount of oil produced from its shale holdings in the US. The CEO of the international oil and gas corporate giant, Darren Woods, also expressed his concern that a lot of oil is still being left in the ground. Advancements in technology combined with the rising awareness regarding the non-renewable nature of oil and its limited supplies left for usage is increasing the importance of efficient oil refining so that maximum oil usage is possible. This is expected to further add to growth in the oil refining industry.Story continuesMoreover, the growing aviation industry and the boom in traveling has also added to growth in demand for fuels. As a result, this augments growth in the oil refining market. A surge in the frequency of flights means higher demand for oil refining to provide adequate fuel. On August 9, Reuters reported that despite economic uncertainty and high ticket prices, the post-pandemic travel boom is showing no signs of slowing well into next year. The report also mentions that according to the International Air Transport Association, international travel in 2023 has reached around 90% of pre-pandemic levels.Biggest Oil and Gas Companies in the US: What Are They Up To?The US ranks high among countries with the largest refining capacity. Let's take a look at what some of the key players in the oil refining market in the US are up to. On May 17, Reuters reported that Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) is teaming up with SparkCognition, a big-data analytics firm, to use AI-based technology to process and analyze large amounts of seismic data in their search for new oil reservoirs. SparkCognition’s AI algorithms can help Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) with deep sea exploration as well as production to boost offshore oil output. The technology will use fewer seismic data scans than usual to generate subsurface images to accelerate exploration workflow and save costs. The companies are working to improve operational efficiency and speed and have said that the new process could shorten explorations to less than 9 days from 9 months.On August 9, Reuters reported that oil refiners in the US will run their plants at up to 95% of their capacity, while challenging the extreme summer heat to pump out more fuels. The report also mentions that Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), one of the largest refiners with 13 processing plants, aims to run at 94% of its combined capacity in the third quarter. For more than a year now, the refining industry has been running at above 90% of capacity because of the strong gasoline and diesel demand as well as high profit margins. However, extreme heat has extended over the main US refining hub on the Gulf Coast this summer to cause a number of outages.On August 1, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $5.32, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.73. The company reported a revenue of $36.82 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $2.94 billion.On September 1, Reuters reported that Washington has backed Chevron Corporation’s (NYSE:CVX) plan over how to develop a giant offshore gas field. Discovered more than a decade ago, the giant offshore gas field is known as Aphrodite and holds an estimated 124 billion cubic meters of gas. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a partner in the field with Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) and Israel's Newmed Energy (TLV:NWMD). The Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) led consortium proposed connecting the Aphrodite gas field to Egypt through a subsea pipeline and existing infrastructure. In Egypt the gas can be sold in the domestic market or liquefied and shipped to Europe, which has been affected by the cut-off of Russian suppliesNow that we've discussed what some of the leading oil and gas companies in the US are up to, let's take a look at the 12 states with the largest refining capacity.12 States With The Largest Refining CapacityPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn this article, we have listed 12 states with the largest refining capacity. To collect data for our list, we consulted the 2022 Worldwide Refining Survey report published by the Oil &amp; Gas Journal. We used data obtained for the latest year, which is 2022, in their dataset and narrowed down our selection to rank the 12 top US states with the largest refining capacities based on their crude oil daily processing capacity. The refining capacities are measured in barrels per calendar day (b/cd). 12 states with the largest refining capacity are listed below in ascending order with their respective refining capacities.12 States With The Largest Refining Capacity12.

""We are hearing more 'normalized promotional levels.' Comparatively, it may not look that bad, even though it still will feel somewhat promotional.""Barbecue grills are offered for sale at a Home Depot store on March 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)Groceries are driving consumers' purchasing decisions this weekendWhile featured deals vary from appliances to apparel to toys (with Walmart even offering a 10-foot kids' trampoline for a fraction of the cost), customers are looking to keep their purchases simple, starting with groceries at the top of the list.A recent survey of 518 individuals from Numerator found that over two-thirds of respondents (69%) plan to visit a grocery store to purchase items for Labor Day.This comes as the cost of food at home — what consumers see at their local supermarkets such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and others — increased slightly in July after remaining mostly flat in recent months.Story continuesOver a third of respondents plan to go to mass retailers like Walmart and Target too. Target seems to be playing into the grocery demand. At the top of its deal page, it features savings on its private-label ground beef and cans of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, among other barbecue fan favorites.Other consumers may be bulking up ahead of back-to-school at Sam's Club or Costco (COST), though Costco will be closed on the actual holiday. Overall, consumers aren't planning to do much Labor Day shopping online. Only 7% plan to go to online-only stores such as Amazon (AMZN) or eBay (EBAY) to shop this weekend.Feldman also said consumers are known to shop around holiday events like Mother's Day and July Fourth weekend.He even added: ""Halloween is off to a good start."" (Yes, its only the beginning of September, I know.)Consumers face squeeze from gas prices, credit card debtMeanwhile, in the background, the odds are stacked against consumers' wallets.Higher gas prices are ""still a pain point"" for consumers with the national average gas price at $3.81 per gallon as of Friday, AAA Northeast senior manager Robert Sinclair Jr. told Yahoo Finance.""I worry that with inflation cutting into the family budget, particularly for housing and food, that there isn't a lot left over for gasoline for ... non-essential travel,"" Sinclair said. ""Demand so far this year is 0.9% less than a year ago when gasoline was much more expensive. ... That's very, very telling.""In addition to higher prices at the pump, consumers' wallets are pinched by the cost of groceries, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments, and a rising rate of credit card delinquencies as Americans struggle to pay off credit card debt.Retailers are feeling the pinch in return. Earlier this month, Kohl's (KSS) CFO Jill Timm said ""payment rates [are] down, losses up"" — a potential red flag that consumers are falling behind.""Credit losses did increase over what was obviously a really low year last year,"" Timm added. ""But as anticipated ... we did take early actions as we did anticipate the macroeconomic environment to worsen and people to have less cash in their bank account.""Investors heard a similar message from Macy's (M).""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with investors. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Despite this noise, consumers continue to defy the odds.""The consumer seems to be somewhat resilient,"" Feldman said, especially when it comes to the desire to have the next big thing. ""The consumer is purchasing when they see newness, when they see innovation in the product.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

68,b8c05558-ee58-3b9a-becc-cbcae680ae34,APD,2023-09-04,7 Hot Hydrogen Stocks With Massive Upside,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hot-hydrogen-stocks-massive-114020284.html,1693309220,STORY,"['BE', 'BP', 'APD', 'FCEL', 'LIN', 'HY', 'PLUG']","[Now is a great time to be looking for hydrogen stocks to buy.Hydrogen stocks only continue to gain momentum as the shift toward decarbonization of energy production moves forward. Hydrogen contains roughly three times the energy of a similar amount of gasoline by weight. The combustion of hydrogen emits only water. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat simple comparison should clue readers in on the potential of hydrogen. The world is shifting away from fossil fuels despite the difficulty in doing so and finding the best hydrogen stocks to buy will help you capitalize on that. The hydrogen generation market should grow by more than 10% on an annualized basis between 2022 and 2027. The Rule of 72 dictates that the market for hydrogen stocks to buy should roughly double between 2022 and 2029. The opportunity is clear so let’s look at a few stocks worth considering in the sector. Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) produces a wide variety of atmospheric gases including hydrogen, which makes it one of the more diverse hydrogen stocks to buy.The stock appears to be oversold at the moment creating an opportunity for investors. APD shares are relatively stable compared to many of the more popular pure-play offerings in the sector. That said, there’s plenty of upside in APD shares currently. There’s roughly $45 of upside baked into Air Products &amp; Chemicals shares based on the consensus price and prices are trending upward. The company released earnings in early August that caused prices to drop from $300 to $280 overnight. However, it’s fairly easy to find the positive in that earnings report which provides a reasonable argument in favor of investing now. Air Products &amp; Chemicals expanded during the first half of the year. Although sales contracted slightly in Q2, net income improved. Further, the company increased full-year guidance at that time. Story continuesAPD includes a nice dividend as well so there’s plenty to like all around for moderate investors concerned with capital preservation and upside potential. Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockInvestors seeking hot hydrogen stocks will be well aware of Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) by this point. The company sells a fuel cell-based energy generation platform called Bloom Energy Server. It converts natural gas and biogas into electricity by utilizing combustion. Fortunately for investors, Bloom Energy has been well-received based on its recent financial reports. Q2 revenues increased by 24% to $301.1 million. The company garners most of its income through product and service sales while also receiving revenue installation charges and electricity sales. Bloom Energy is a growth firm that is rapidly improving its business by growing while narrowing its losses. Firm-wide losses reached $121.165 million in Q2 ‘22 narrowing to $69.06 million a year later. Bloom Energy may be perceived as a young, volatile firm but I see it as one that is rapidly maturing based on recent results. It’s hard to argue against this being one of the better hydrogen stocks to buy on future potential in a growing field. Linde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comLinde (NYSE:LIN), like Air Products &amp; Chemicals, is a more mature industrial gases and chemicals firm and stock. That means investors receive the stability of a well-established firm and one that like Air Products &amp; Chemicals, is also expected to appreciate in value and offers strong upside. Dividends are 0n offer, too, and LIN shares have not seen their dividend reduced since 1996, making this one of the best hydrogen stocks to buy for dividends.Linde is arguably the best moderate choice for hydrogen investors at this point. Sales contracted slightly during the second quarter. However, Linde has weathered business cycles before and was able to increase operating margins and EPS by roughly 15% in the period. The company also increased its EPS guidance for the remainder of 2023 further suggesting that it’s a very well-run firm. The firm operates 80 hydrogen plants globally and more than 200 hydrogen refueling stations. Linde has built a strong infrastructural network to underpin the hydrogen economy. It’s a stable firm and investment overall. Hyster-Yale Materials (HY)silhouettes of a forklift and driver as well as two workers by a semi truck backdropped by a sunset sky. represents the supply chainSource: shutterstock.com/By yuttana Contributor StudioHyster-Yale Materials (NYSE:HY) stock represents a firm that makes lift trucks and vehicles including forklifts. The materials handling sector has adopted hydrogen fuel cell technology faster than some other sectors making HY part of this conversation. The firm’s fundamentals clearly speak to an opportunity for investors. Hyster-Yale Materials’ sales increased by 22% in Q2, reaching $1.1 billion. Perhaps net income turned positive in both H1 and Q2 after both periods ended in losses last year. Hyster-Yale Materials began piloting hydrogen-powered container handler vehicles at the Port of Los Angeles late last year. It speaks to the industrial adoption of hydrogen fuel cells across industrial vehicles. That not only creates revenue streams but also real-world testing that could result in adaptations to uses in other sectors. HY stock is more volatile than other established firms in this article, like Linde. However, if the company can continue to maintain profitability, it will emerge as a name in the hydrogen conversation as more investors understand the industrial applicability of hydrogen.  BP (BP)BP stock: the BP company logo on a buildingSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.comBP (NYSE:BP) stands for British Petroleum, a firm headquartered in London, the financial heart of Europe, which is known for its environmentally forward thinking. Thus, it shouldn’t surprise investors that BP stock is invested heavily into hydrogen relative to its peers across the pond. The argument favoring BP has less to do with its current fundamentals than it does with the long-term potential of the firm. BP’s operations have faltered in 2023 overall. That’s due to commodity cyclicality as much as anything. Oil is volatile and nearly impossible to predict. Oil firms like BP address this issue, which tends to make their stocks volatile, by focusing on investor income. BP’s 4.2% dividend smooths the bumps so to speak. BP provides income but also a future-forward, European outlook. The firm is building the largest blue hydrogen production plant in the U.K. The project will include massive carbon capture operations and aims to produce over 10% of the UK government’s hydrogen target for 2030.Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a hydrogen stock that embodies extremes that make it very difficult to pin down. It’s very easy to either get behind the stock and just as easy to discount it for that reason. Here’s what I mean. Plug Power is marked by some impressive stats including the fact that the company has deployed more than 60,000 hydrogen fuel cell systems for e-mobility, more than any other firm globally. The company is also the largest buyer of liquid hydrogen and built and operates a hydrogen highway that spans the continental U.S. Assuming the hydrogen market grows as expected, it’s very difficult to argue against Plug Power. The company’s growth trajectory currently substantiates exactly that narrative. Revenues increased by 72% to $260.18 million in the second quarter. That growth is similar to the growth the company experienced in the first half. The issue is that Plug Power is moving farther away from profitability all the while. Net losses are growing as well and the company produces roughly $1 of losses for every dollar in sales. The upside is clear but it might make sense to wait for signs of a move toward future profitability before jumping in. FuelCell Energy (FCEL)a picture of a fuel cellSource: Kaca Skokanova/ShutterstockFuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) also provides fuel cell energy platforms. However, the stock represents stationary hydrogen power production. FCEL stock is also very inexpensive at $1.35. Although the shares aren’t highly rated at this time they’re worth considering. I say that because FuelCell Energy is headed in the right direction. Revenues increased by 134% in Q2 while losses hardly grew at the same time. That trajectory is very suggestive that the company is on the precipice of beginning to reduce its losses. If that happens it’ll be in hypergrowth mode while heading toward profitability. That can create a snowball effect with a very positive trajectory. The company lost more than $33 million in the second quarter. However, it also boasts more than $350 million in cash so it’s not as risky as its price may suggest. The company has ongoing projects with Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) which lend it further credibility. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Ron DeSantis to just a free speech claim that the Florida governor retaliated against the company because of its public opposition to a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades.Disney on Friday asked a federal judge for permission to file an amended complaint focusing just on the First Amendment claim and leaving to another, state-court lawsuit questions about the legality of agreements the company signed with Disney World's governing district, then-made up of Disney supporters. The agreements were signed before DeSantis and the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature took over the governmental body in the spring.The agreements shifted control of design and construction at the theme park resort from the new DeSantis appointees on the board of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD) to Disney. The DeSantis appointees are now challenging the legality of the agreements in state court. DeSantis isn't a party in the state court lawsuit.“Disney faces concrete, imminent, and ongoing injury as a result of CFTOD’s new powers and composition, which are being used to punish Disney for expressing a political view,"" said Disney's federal court motion.The revised complaint would challenge “this unconstitutional weaponization of government by seeking a declaratory judgment that will allow Disney to pursue its future in Florida free from the ongoing retaliatory actions of the CFTOD Board,” Disney said.U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor on Friday rejected Disney's motion to narrow the scope because of a procedural rule requiring Disney attorneys to confer with DeSantis' attorneys before filing such a request. The judge said Disney could refile its request after complying with the court rule. An email seeking comment was sent to Disney attorneys on Sunday.The Disney request, as well as other recent motions filed in the state case, demonstrate how the fates of the two lawsuits have become intertwined, especially after Disney filed a counter-claim in the state case asserting many of the same claims made in the federal case. Disney filed the counter claim after the state court judge refused Disney’s request to dismiss the lawsuit.Story continuesThe fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors’ authority was limited by the company’s agreements with predecessors.In response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

At midnight, with the two sides unable to reach a new, multiyear programming contract, Charter’s 14.7 million TV subscribers lost access to ABC, ESPN, and other Disney-owned channels, including coverage of the US Open tennis tournament this weekend.Neither side appears ready to budge. ESPN took to social media to alert Charter customers that the network had been cut from their lineup, offering up a link to more information. Charter, which offers TV service under the Spectrum brand in cities like New York and Los Angeles, shot out its own notices to customers and held an impromptu call with investors early Friday.“We’re on the edge of a precipice,” Charter Chief Executive Officer Chris Winfrey said on the call. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”Entertainment and cable stocks tumbled. Disney, whose businesses includes theme parks and cruise ships, was down 2.4% at the close Friday in New York. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. slumped 12% and Paramount Global, the parent of CBS, slid 10%. Charter was down 3.6% and Comcast Corp., the No. 1 cable provider, declined 2.2%.An estimated $4 billion in revenue, including distribution fees and advertising, is on the line for Disney, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. But the stakes may be even higher for the broader media and pay TV industry, according to analysts at Lightshed Partners LLC who call it a “watershed moment.”Story continuesWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:The pay-TV industry lost nearly 25 million total users in 2015-22 and we calculate it will lose 6.7 million more by year-end.— Geetha Ranganathan, senior analystClick here to read the research.Winfrey saw this coming. Seven years ago, Charter’s CEO warned of a growing consumer rebellion against soaring pay-TV rates, especially the high price for sports coverage that many consumers never watch. Monthly cable bills today average about $126, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Winfrey called on major media companies like Disney to let Charter package channels in ways that would slow the loss of viewers to streaming.“It’s still not easy to put small packages together that are compelling and it’s not in the interest of big programmers to let that happen,” Winfrey said.Financial disputes between media companies and their cable partners are nothing new, and consumers have routinely endured blackouts. Customers of DirecTV, for example, have been unable to see stations owned by Nexstar Media Group Inc. for the past two months, missing out on programs from Fox, CBS and NBC.But the fight between Charter and Disney looks bigger. Cable TV subscriber losses have accelerated in recent years, with the industry now down to about 70 million customers from a peak of more than 100 million.That’s led Disney and its chief executive officer, Bob Iger, to rethink the company’s long-term commitment to traditional cable and broadcast programming.Iger made that clear at a July conference of media and tech executives in Sun Valley, Idaho. He said Disney was exploring options to bypass cable providers and sell ESPN directly to consumers, possibly through a partnership. He also declared that traditional TV networks may not be a core asset, and raised the prospect of selling ABC and the company’s non-sports cable channels.Disney has been investing heavily in its own direct-to-consumer streaming services — Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu — making them an alternative outlet for its vast library of entertainment.Winfrey, who earlier in his career worked in Europe, where customers more often pay for separate packages of sports programming, appears to have been preparing for a showdown with Disney. Both Charter and industry leader Comcast Corp. have recently introduced lower-cost cable TV packages that have fewer channels than standard subscriptions and are among the first in the industry to exclude Disney’s ESPN.Starting as early as this month, Charter will offer two tiers of TV packages. One, called Spectrum Select Plus, provides an extensive sports lineup including local regional sports networks. The other, called Spectrum Select Signature, excludes sports. Charter also plans to launch a streaming service for its customers that includes regional sports networks as an alternative to the cable TV offer.Disney is asking for increases in the roughly $2.2 billion in subscriber fees it gets from Charter annually. Charter wants Disney to lower the minimum number of subscribers that it has to pay for, so it can offer more packages without sports.Charter is also asking Disney to let it give streaming services like Disney+ and Hulu to its premium cable customers for free, arguing that much of that content was created for traditional TV viewers, according to people familiar with the discussions who asked to not be named. For consumers who use Charter only for internet access, the company wants to offer Disney’s streaming services under a revenue-sharing agreement.The clock is ticking. On one side Disney is casting about for a new video strategy that could include offering ESPN through an online subscription service. It’s also dealing with a halt in film and TV production because of the strike by Hollywood actors and writers.On the Charter side, TV subscribers woke up Friday unable to watch popular channels like ABC or ESPN. They may soon face a blackout of football games as the college and NFL seasons begin.“The stark reality is the media and distribution landscape has been building up to this moment for many years,” analyst Craig Moffett, with MoffettNathanson Research, wrote in a research note. “It’s becoming clearer than ever that there is no going back.

(NASDAQ:AKAM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$823.9mUS$990.2mUS$1.18bUS$1.29bUS$1.37bUS$1.45bUS$1.51bUS$1.56bUS$1.61bUS$1.66bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.58%Est @ 5.25%Est @ 4.32%Est @ 3.67%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$762US$848US$931US$945US$932US$907US$876US$840US$802US$764(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.6bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.2%) = US$29bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$29b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$13bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$105, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Akamai Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.185. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Akamai TechnologiesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive How Much Debt Does Colgate-Palmolive Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Colgate-Palmolive had debt of US$8.99b, up from US$7.99b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$1.09b in cash leading to net debt of about US$7.90b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Colgate-Palmolive's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.63b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.3b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.09b and US$1.66b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$13.2b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Colgate-Palmolive has a huge market capitalization of US$60.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Colgate-Palmolive's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 16.5 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Unfortunately, Colgate-Palmolive saw its EBIT slide 6.4% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Colgate-Palmolive produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 68% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThe good news is that Colgate-Palmolive's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Colgate-Palmolive can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Colgate-Palmolive .Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

This suggested the Federal Reserve will not put a further dampener on the economy by raising interest rates this month.Additionally, PMI readings showed that business activity in the world’s largest economy remained robust, pushing up hopes that oil demand will remain relatively strong despite an expected seasonal downturn.Story continuesU.S. data releases this week are unlikely to significantly change the dial, there are several Fed speakers during the coming week, including Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, who speaks Wednesday.In China, manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in August, data from Caixin's manufacturing PMI survey indicated, reducing some of the pessimism about the economic health of the world's largest oil importer.Chinese trade data are due on Thursday, and traders will be looking for evidence of increased crude demand, as a sign of a growing economy.Speculators reduce Brent net longsElsewhere, the latest positioning data shows that speculators reduced their net long in ICE Brent by 15,544 lots over the last reporting week, leaving them with a net long of 202,227 lots as of last Tuesday.“However, given the move in the market since then, along with the increase in open interest, the actual speculative net long has likely increased,” added ING.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil prices drift lower; producers set to outline future output levelsRussia strikes Ukrainian grain exporting port before Putin-Erdogan talksOil steady amid OPEC+ supply cut expectations]"

(NYSE:PRU) A Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-9-return-equity-prudential-140014088.html,1693749614,STORY,['PRU'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prudential Financial is:6.9% = US$2.0b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.07.Does Prudential Financial Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Prudential Financial has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Insurance industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Prudential Financial's Debt And Its 6.9% Return On EquityPrudential Financial does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Prudential Financial may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Basically, the theory is the reverse of the adage, sell in May and go away. Those who did sell in May are now returning from their summer vacations and getting back to work. Further, with traders bidding up the hottest flavors of the week in the technology space, several opportunities exist that are simply overlooked – for now.With thousands of publicly traded companies listed on major U.S. exchanges, it’s practically impossible to keep track of all of them with the same care and attention. That just makes the stock picks below all the more enticing.Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comAn icon in the home improvement retail space, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a reliable everyday performer. However, it’s only up a bit over 2% since the Jan. opener. Likely, investors are focused on the hottest technology plays, thereby providing little attention to HD. Still, in the past six months, HD gained a hair over 9%. With shares down 2% in the trailing 30 days, this might be one of the stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinancially, you’re looking at a consistent growth and profitability machine. On the top line, Home Depot prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 15.2%, beating out 76.39% of its peers. Also during the same period, its EBITDA growth rate pops at 16.7%, above 65%. Lastly, the company runs a trailing-year operating margin of 14.88%, outflanking 87.67% of the competition.Notably, analysts peg HD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $342.48, implying a bit over 6% upside potential.Cintas (CTAS)Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Mason, Ohio, Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides a range of products and services to its enterprise-level clients. These include uniforms, mats, cleaning supplies, and safety products such as fire extinguishers and testing equipment. It’s a vital cog of the broader infrastructure and investors recognize this fact. Since the start of the year, CTAS gained more than 10% of its equity value.Story continuesStill, there could be more upside here, making CTAS one of the stocks to buy now. Financially, as with Home Depot above, it’s not a sexy business but it gets the job done with consistently solid sales growth and profitability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.8%, above nearly 64% of its peers. And it features an operating margin of 20.45%, above 85.45%.Significantly, analysts regard CTAS as one of the viable stock picks, pegging it as a moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target comes in at $531.08, implying 7% upside potential.Tractor Supply (TSCO)The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) storeSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.comFounded in 1938, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a retail chain that sells products for home improvement, agriculture, lawn/garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers. As well, the company serves pet owners and landowners. Naturally, Tractor Supply represents a critical partner for the future of U.S. agriculture. Therefore, it should make a great case for stocks to buy now.To be fair, since the start of the year, TSCO slipped more than 4%. However, this might be a temporary rough patch. For example, in the trailing one-year period, TSCO is up nearly 12%. More importantly, against a financial framework, Tractor Supply prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.3%, above 83.94% of its peers. In addition, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period clocks in at an impressive 26.8%. And it’s consistently profitable year in and year out. Lastly, analysts peg TSCO as a moderate buy. Their average price target hits $244.33, implying over 14% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comUnlike the other stock picks on this write-up, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in my opinion doesn’t have a sense of urgency per se. Don’t get me wrong: As a compelling and relevant pharmaceutical giant, ABBV makes sense no matter what. Plus, the company features a dividend yield of 3.98% per TipRanks, which is well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.5%.However, ABBV slipped almost 10% since the start of the year. In the past 365 days, shares gained under 8%, which seems overly pessimistic. With AbbVie acquiring Allergan (and thus the Botox unit), the pharmaceutical firm enjoys a gargantuan total addressable market.Basically, the looks-oriented (I don’t want to say superficial but I’m thinking it) demographics of Millennials and Generation Z will eventually get older. With no safe spaces protecting them from the aging process, Botox could be a powerful coping mechanism. Yeah, it’s awfully cynical but potentially viable. Anyways, I’m not sure if analysts agree but they peg ABBV as a moderate buy. With an implied growth of nearly 17%, it’s one of the stocks to buy now (if you want).Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefrontSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of beauty stores, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) just released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Per Barron’s, the company posted earnings per share of $6.02 on revenue of $2.53 billion. In contrast, analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipated the company to post EPS of $5.85 on sales of $2.5 billion. So, a top-and-bottom beat should make ULTA one of the top stock picks, right?Well, the market had other ideas. On the day of the disclosure, ULTA fell nearly 4%. And in the after-hours session, it gained just a tenth of a percent. What the flappity is all this? Honestly, I’m not sure if any analyst provided an explanation. Management noted – through data of course – that it’s essentially a recession-resistant business. Maybe investors are skeptical about that.For me, social normalization trends – particularly the return to the office – bode well for ULTA. In my view, it’s one of the stocks to buy now on the weakness. Overall, analysts view ULTA as a moderate buy. Their average price target of $532.89 implies nearly 31% growth.Paycom (PAYC)Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhoneSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWith the last two stock picks, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward profile, beginning with Paycom (NYSE:PAYC). Based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Paycom is an online payroll and human resource technology provider. Per its public profile, the company is one of the pioneering fully online payroll providers. It’s also one of the fastest-growing firms.Unfortunately, this status hasn’t impressed Wall Street this year. Since the Jan. opener, shares have been all over the map, presently down 6%. Over the past 365 days, PAYC slipped almost 21%. However, investors may be too pessimistic. For one thing, the company benefits from a strong balance sheet, especially its cash-to-debt ratio of 18.5x. Operationally, Paycom prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.2%, above 78.47% of its peers. And it’s consistently profitable with a net margin of 20.3%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts view PAYC as a strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $384.27, implying over 34% upside potential.ResMed (RMD)ResMed logo on a tablet on a yellow background. RMD stock.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, ResMed (NYSE:RMD) is a medical equipment company. Per its corporate profile, ResMed provides cloud-connectable medical devices for the treatment of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory conditions. However, investors are extremely skeptical about RMD. Since the beginning of the year, shares fell 23%.Granted, I understand the risky and often volatile nature of the medical equipment industry. At the same time, the global sleep apnea devices market may be worth about $5.8 billion this year. Further, experts project that the sector could hit $8 billion by 2028, representing a CAGR of 6.5%.Also, ResMed enjoys a solid growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate hit 12.2%, above 63.21% of its peers. Plus, it’s consistently profitable, leveraging a net margin of 21.25%. Looking to the Street, analysts peg RMD as a strong buy. Their average price target stands at $249.60, implying 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

With no safe spaces protecting them from the aging process, Botox could be a powerful coping mechanism. Yeah, it’s awfully cynical but potentially viable. Anyways, I’m not sure if analysts agree but they peg ABBV as a moderate buy. With an implied growth of nearly 17%, it’s one of the stocks to buy now (if you want).Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefrontSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of beauty stores, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) just released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Per Barron’s, the company posted earnings per share of $6.02 on revenue of $2.53 billion. In contrast, analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipated the company to post EPS of $5.85 on sales of $2.5 billion. So, a top-and-bottom beat should make ULTA one of the top stock picks, right?Well, the market had other ideas. On the day of the disclosure, ULTA fell nearly 4%. And in the after-hours session, it gained just a tenth of a percent. What the flappity is all this? Honestly, I’m not sure if any analyst provided an explanation. Management noted – through data of course – that it’s essentially a recession-resistant business. Maybe investors are skeptical about that.For me, social normalization trends – particularly the return to the office – bode well for ULTA. In my view, it’s one of the stocks to buy now on the weakness. Overall, analysts view ULTA as a moderate buy. Their average price target of $532.89 implies nearly 31% growth.Paycom (PAYC)Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhoneSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWith the last two stock picks, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward profile, beginning with Paycom (NYSE:PAYC). Based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Paycom is an online payroll and human resource technology provider. Per its public profile, the company is one of the pioneering fully online payroll providers. It’s also one of the fastest-growing firms.Unfortunately, this status hasn’t impressed Wall Street this year. Since the Jan. opener, shares have been all over the map, presently down 6%. Over the past 365 days, PAYC slipped almost 21%. However, investors may be too pessimistic. For one thing, the company benefits from a strong balance sheet, especially its cash-to-debt ratio of 18.5x. Operationally, Paycom prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.2%, above 78.47% of its peers. And it’s consistently profitable with a net margin of 20.3%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts view PAYC as a strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $384.27, implying over 34% upside potential.ResMed (RMD)ResMed logo on a tablet on a yellow background. RMD stock.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, ResMed (NYSE:RMD) is a medical equipment company. Per its corporate profile, ResMed provides cloud-connectable medical devices for the treatment of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory conditions. However, investors are extremely skeptical about RMD. Since the beginning of the year, shares fell 23%.Granted, I understand the risky and often volatile nature of the medical equipment industry. At the same time, the global sleep apnea devices market may be worth about $5.8 billion this year. Further, experts project that the sector could hit $8 billion by 2028, representing a CAGR of 6.5%.Also, ResMed enjoys a solid growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate hit 12.2%, above 63.21% of its peers. Plus, it’s consistently profitable, leveraging a net margin of 21.25%. Looking to the Street, analysts peg RMD as a strong buy. Their average price target stands at $249.60, implying 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, amid the ebbs and flows, a few promising bank stocks defy the trends. Rising interest rates, a drooping consumer sentiment and haunting specters of regional bank collapse largely set the tone for an uneasy banking industry.Nevertheless, while the industry grappled with a domino effect of sharp corrections, it’s pivotal to note that not all bank stocks deserved the market’s wary side-eye. With that said, let’s look at three of the top promising bank stocks to wager on offering strong upside ahead.JPMorgan (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stands as a behemoth in the financial realm, with its diversified business segments, including consumer banking, investment banking, commercial banking, and notably, asset and wealth management (AWM). Such diverse anchoring protects JPM against economic tides and regulatory shifts and reinforces its trajectory for long-term growth. With a robust AWM arm, stalwart consumer lending and a crown jewel of investment banking, JPM is effectively curbing costs while channeling investments into tech enhancements, showcasing powerful adaptability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe past year saw the bank flourish, notching a commendable 26% return. However, year-to-date gains stand at just 9.21% because of the headwinds surrounding the banking sphere. Nevertheless, JPM has effectively weathered the storm, offering an enticing forward yield of 2.7%. Additionally, its second-quarter financial scoreboard glittered with $38.6 billion in sales, marking a 26% year-over-year surge. Accentuated by both interest and non-interest gains, JPM undoubtedly shines brightly among big, promising bank stocks.Capital One (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comSwimming against the current of its peers, Capital One (NYSE:COF) has dazzled the market this year, delivering a handsome 9.27% year-to-date gain for its investors. While its second-quarter net income of $1.4 billion may seem like a step back from last year, it’s imperative to see the broader picture, with the stock trading at an appealing one times forward sales estimates. Moreover, Richard D. Fairbank, its CEO, emphasized the company’s forward-leaning tech infrastructure in the recent second-quarter press release, hinting at brighter avenues for growth.Story continuesOn top of that, Warren Buffett continues to back the firm to come out of the current crisis relatively unscathed. His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) boosted its stake in Capital One by 2.5 million shares, now tipping the scale at $1.3 billion. Despite choppy waters, such as the regional banking turbulence and Moody’s cloudy forecast, Buffett’s continued faith in Capital One speaks volumes.New York Community Bancorp (NYCB)New York Community Bancorp logo on a smartphone screen.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockIn a year where regional banks have tempestuous waves, with three succumbing to the tide, New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) has fared remarkably well compared to its competition. NYCB not only entices with its performance but also woos with its powerful dividend. It boasts an incredible yield of over 5.7%, with 21 consecutive years of payouts. Additionally, the bank’s strategic move of assimilating the bulk of deposits and a staggering $13 billion in loans from Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY) has catapulted its assets, marking a 35% surge to a whopping $120 billion.The bank’s second-quarter financials have only solidified its stature in its niche. With an adjusted EPS of 47 cents, it has effortlessly overshadowed the 31 cents analyst prediction and the net interest income of $900 million, surpassing the $771 billion consensus. With a 219% year-over-year rise in total revenue, the financial horizon looks tremendously promising.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

""We are hearing more 'normalized promotional levels.' Comparatively, it may not look that bad, even though it still will feel somewhat promotional.""Barbecue grills are offered for sale at a Home Depot store on March 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)Groceries are driving consumers' purchasing decisions this weekendWhile featured deals vary from appliances to apparel to toys (with Walmart even offering a 10-foot kids' trampoline for a fraction of the cost), customers are looking to keep their purchases simple, starting with groceries at the top of the list.A recent survey of 518 individuals from Numerator found that over two-thirds of respondents (69%) plan to visit a grocery store to purchase items for Labor Day.This comes as the cost of food at home — what consumers see at their local supermarkets such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and others — increased slightly in July after remaining mostly flat in recent months.Story continuesOver a third of respondents plan to go to mass retailers like Walmart and Target too. Target seems to be playing into the grocery demand. At the top of its deal page, it features savings on its private-label ground beef and cans of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, among other barbecue fan favorites.Other consumers may be bulking up ahead of back-to-school at Sam's Club or Costco (COST), though Costco will be closed on the actual holiday. Overall, consumers aren't planning to do much Labor Day shopping online. Only 7% plan to go to online-only stores such as Amazon (AMZN) or eBay (EBAY) to shop this weekend.Feldman also said consumers are known to shop around holiday events like Mother's Day and July Fourth weekend.He even added: ""Halloween is off to a good start."" (Yes, its only the beginning of September, I know.)Consumers face squeeze from gas prices, credit card debtMeanwhile, in the background, the odds are stacked against consumers' wallets.Higher gas prices are ""still a pain point"" for consumers with the national average gas price at $3.81 per gallon as of Friday, AAA Northeast senior manager Robert Sinclair Jr. told Yahoo Finance.""I worry that with inflation cutting into the family budget, particularly for housing and food, that there isn't a lot left over for gasoline for ... non-essential travel,"" Sinclair said. ""Demand so far this year is 0.9% less than a year ago when gasoline was much more expensive. ... That's very, very telling.""In addition to higher prices at the pump, consumers' wallets are pinched by the cost of groceries, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments, and a rising rate of credit card delinquencies as Americans struggle to pay off credit card debt.Retailers are feeling the pinch in return. Earlier this month, Kohl's (KSS) CFO Jill Timm said ""payment rates [are] down, losses up"" — a potential red flag that consumers are falling behind.""Credit losses did increase over what was obviously a really low year last year,"" Timm added. ""But as anticipated ... we did take early actions as we did anticipate the macroeconomic environment to worsen and people to have less cash in their bank account.""Investors heard a similar message from Macy's (M).""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with investors. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Despite this noise, consumers continue to defy the odds.""The consumer seems to be somewhat resilient,"" Feldman said, especially when it comes to the desire to have the next big thing. ""The consumer is purchasing when they see newness, when they see innovation in the product.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Basically, the theory is the reverse of the adage, sell in May and go away. Those who did sell in May are now returning from their summer vacations and getting back to work. Further, with traders bidding up the hottest flavors of the week in the technology space, several opportunities exist that are simply overlooked – for now.With thousands of publicly traded companies listed on major U.S. exchanges, it’s practically impossible to keep track of all of them with the same care and attention. That just makes the stock picks below all the more enticing.Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comAn icon in the home improvement retail space, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a reliable everyday performer. However, it’s only up a bit over 2% since the Jan. opener. Likely, investors are focused on the hottest technology plays, thereby providing little attention to HD. Still, in the past six months, HD gained a hair over 9%. With shares down 2% in the trailing 30 days, this might be one of the stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinancially, you’re looking at a consistent growth and profitability machine. On the top line, Home Depot prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 15.2%, beating out 76.39% of its peers. Also during the same period, its EBITDA growth rate pops at 16.7%, above 65%. Lastly, the company runs a trailing-year operating margin of 14.88%, outflanking 87.67% of the competition.Notably, analysts peg HD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $342.48, implying a bit over 6% upside potential.Cintas (CTAS)Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Mason, Ohio, Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides a range of products and services to its enterprise-level clients. These include uniforms, mats, cleaning supplies, and safety products such as fire extinguishers and testing equipment. It’s a vital cog of the broader infrastructure and investors recognize this fact. Since the start of the year, CTAS gained more than 10% of its equity value.Story continuesStill, there could be more upside here, making CTAS one of the stocks to buy now. Financially, as with Home Depot above, it’s not a sexy business but it gets the job done with consistently solid sales growth and profitability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.8%, above nearly 64% of its peers. And it features an operating margin of 20.45%, above 85.45%.Significantly, analysts regard CTAS as one of the viable stock picks, pegging it as a moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target comes in at $531.08, implying 7% upside potential.Tractor Supply (TSCO)The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) storeSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.comFounded in 1938, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a retail chain that sells products for home improvement, agriculture, lawn/garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers. As well, the company serves pet owners and landowners. Naturally, Tractor Supply represents a critical partner for the future of U.S. agriculture. Therefore, it should make a great case for stocks to buy now.To be fair, since the start of the year, TSCO slipped more than 4%. However, this might be a temporary rough patch. For example, in the trailing one-year period, TSCO is up nearly 12%. More importantly, against a financial framework, Tractor Supply prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.3%, above 83.94% of its peers. In addition, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period clocks in at an impressive 26.8%. And it’s consistently profitable year in and year out. Lastly, analysts peg TSCO as a moderate buy. Their average price target hits $244.33, implying over 14% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comUnlike the other stock picks on this write-up, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in my opinion doesn’t have a sense of urgency per se. Don’t get me wrong: As a compelling and relevant pharmaceutical giant, ABBV makes sense no matter what. Plus, the company features a dividend yield of 3.98% per TipRanks, which is well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.5%.However, ABBV slipped almost 10% since the start of the year. In the past 365 days, shares gained under 8%, which seems overly pessimistic. With AbbVie acquiring Allergan (and thus the Botox unit), the pharmaceutical firm enjoys a gargantuan total addressable market.Basically, the looks-oriented (I don’t want to say superficial but I’m thinking it) demographics of Millennials and Generation Z will eventually get older. With no safe spaces protecting them from the aging process, Botox could be a powerful coping mechanism. Yeah, it’s awfully cynical but potentially viable. Anyways, I’m not sure if analysts agree but they peg ABBV as a moderate buy. With an implied growth of nearly 17%, it’s one of the stocks to buy now (if you want).Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefrontSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of beauty stores, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) just released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Per Barron’s, the company posted earnings per share of $6.02 on revenue of $2.53 billion. In contrast, analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipated the company to post EPS of $5.85 on sales of $2.5 billion. So, a top-and-bottom beat should make ULTA one of the top stock picks, right?Well, the market had other ideas. On the day of the disclosure, ULTA fell nearly 4%. And in the after-hours session, it gained just a tenth of a percent. What the flappity is all this? Honestly, I’m not sure if any analyst provided an explanation. Management noted – through data of course – that it’s essentially a recession-resistant business. Maybe investors are skeptical about that.For me, social normalization trends – particularly the return to the office – bode well for ULTA. In my view, it’s one of the stocks to buy now on the weakness. Overall, analysts view ULTA as a moderate buy. Their average price target of $532.89 implies nearly 31% growth.Paycom (PAYC)Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhoneSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWith the last two stock picks, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward profile, beginning with Paycom (NYSE:PAYC). Based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Paycom is an online payroll and human resource technology provider. Per its public profile, the company is one of the pioneering fully online payroll providers. It’s also one of the fastest-growing firms.Unfortunately, this status hasn’t impressed Wall Street this year. Since the Jan. opener, shares have been all over the map, presently down 6%. Over the past 365 days, PAYC slipped almost 21%. However, investors may be too pessimistic. For one thing, the company benefits from a strong balance sheet, especially its cash-to-debt ratio of 18.5x. Operationally, Paycom prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.2%, above 78.47% of its peers. And it’s consistently profitable with a net margin of 20.3%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts view PAYC as a strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $384.27, implying over 34% upside potential.ResMed (RMD)ResMed logo on a tablet on a yellow background. RMD stock.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, ResMed (NYSE:RMD) is a medical equipment company. Per its corporate profile, ResMed provides cloud-connectable medical devices for the treatment of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory conditions. However, investors are extremely skeptical about RMD. Since the beginning of the year, shares fell 23%.Granted, I understand the risky and often volatile nature of the medical equipment industry.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 5 Biggest Generative AI Companies In The World.Generative AI is a powerful tool that has penetrated almost all industries and has found numerous useful applications. The remarkable capability of generative AI to create novel texts, codes, audio, images, digital art, and videos based on text prompts has sparked global interest. After the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the industry has been marked by a galvanizing plurality of generative AI companies and startups. The generative AI market is highly competitive, and companies are rolling out innovative features to stay ahead of each other.The Generative AI Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the generative artificial intelligence market was valued at $13 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $109.37 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.6%. North America dominated the generative AI market in 2022 accounting for 40.2% of total market revenue. The region is expected to grow consistently during the forecast period at a CAGR of 35.6%. The Asia Pacific region has been projected to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast period, with a CAGR of 36.5%. The generative AI market is divided into two main segments: software and services. The software segment is the most dominant and contributed 64.8% to the total revenue share in 2022. Tech giants like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the major players in the generative AI market.Generative AI is impacting almost all industries including gaming, healthcare, media, and entertainment. According to estimates by McKinsey, generative AI could add $200 billion to $340 billion annually in the banking industry and $400 billion to $660 billion annually in the retail and consumer packaged goods industry. Story continuesGartner has estimated that 30% of all outbound messages by large organizations would be generated by AI by 2025, compared to only 2% in 2022. The increasing use of AI in business could prompt the appointment of chief AI officers in 35% of large organizations by 2025. The proliferation of generative AI indicates the profound impact this new technology is bound to have on enterprises. The most evident influence is on enterprise productivity. Generative AI For Productivity Research done on customer service workers at a Fortune 500 software firm concluded that using generative AI tools enhanced productivity by 14% on average. The least skilled workers benefited the most as they completed their work 35% faster. Generative AI companies have started developing features, especially for businesses. Using generative AI could add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is investing heavily in generative AI startups and is the most influential investor in OpenAI. On July 18, according to an article by the Financial Times, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced Copilot, a generative AI feature for its productivity software particularly for enterprises. The company is charging $30 per user. The generative AI feature is meant to add value and enhance enterprise productivity. The AI assistant would be integrated into Microsoft 365 enabling users to access generative AI to perform functions like summarizing daily emails and tasks. According to McKinsey, AI has the potential to absorb up to 70% of employees' time by automation. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also working on generative AI and has a chatbot, Bard, similar to ChatGPT. The company is currently rolling out a generative AI feature to its search tool. This feature can summarize search results and show text and visual results based on prompts. On August 29, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced artificial intelligence tools specifically made for businesses. Enterprises can access these tools at $30 per month for each user. Duet AI in Workspace, one of the new tools introduced, allows users to utilize generative AI in Gmail, Slides, and Docs.Generative AI enables the user to communicate with machines in natural language. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released a generative AI model capable of writing code, Code Llama, on August 24. The platform can generate code from scratch based on text prompts. It can also be used to debug code. Code Llama could greatly enhance productivity by reducing the time required to write code. Code Llama by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) supports all main programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. This tool was launched in competition with the previously available Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) code-writing tool, GitHub Copilot, launched in January. On June 13, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) CEO Bill McDermott appeared in an interview for CNBC and commented on how artificial intelligence could dramatically increase productivity. He also briefly mentioned how the introduction of AI would influence jobs overall:""I think you will see jobs perhaps move from one part of the enterprise to another but giving people in the enterprise personalized, relevant and contextual self-service with accurate human language responses to general questions is a game changer. And what I think people are underestimating for enterprise AI is how this intelligent conversational experience will improve productivity at a dramatic rate. So, we can move from just cost out to productivity and growth on and I think that's really what folks are trying to do. I am not interested in taking jobs out of enterprises (using AI) but I am interested in improving productivity dramatically and helping CEO's reinvent their business models so they could grow again and that's really what this is all.""The world is going through a digital revolution.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for LyondellBasell Industries:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$37b - US$7.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 11%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured LyondellBasell Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for LyondellBasell Industries.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at LyondellBasell Industries doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 27% over the last five years. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From LyondellBasell Industries' ROCEFrom the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for LyondellBasell Industries have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Despite the concerning underlying trends, the stock has actually gained 25% over the last five years, so it might be that the investors are expecting the trends to reverse. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.LyondellBasell Industries does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries  that you might be interested in.While LyondellBasell Industries isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

In the first half of 2023, S&amp;P 500 companies have repurchased $385 billion in stock despite paying over $3 billion in tax on the share repurchases due to the 1% tax that went into effect on Jan. 1.  Many companies feel share repurchases are an excellent capital allocation lever to pull. When a company announces a new share repurchase plan, its shares often rise on the news because it indicates management is enthusiastic about the stock’s appreciation potential. However, that is not always the case. In mid-August, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) announced a $15 billion share repurchase plan. Unfortunately, year-over-year declines in both sales and earnings sent HD stock lower in the days since. Barring any bad earnings news shortly, these three companies have initiated stock buybacks this summer that should send their stocks higher in the coming weeks and months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNVR (NVR)The logo for NVR is seen on the top of an office building.Source: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.comSince 2020, NVR (NYSE:NVR) has repurchased $3.6 billion of its stock. They are showing no sign of stopping now. The homebuilder recently announced that its board authorized a $500 million share repurchase. The company is one of three homebuilding stocks that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) bought in the second quarter, indicating that the holding company believes interest rates will soon fall, combined with an ongoing need for more housing in America.Through the first six months of 2023, NVR sold 11,034 homes at an average price of $454,000. As of June 30, it had a backlog of 12,286 homes at an average price of $458,600, which means it’s getting more for houses to be built than those already made in the year’s first half. Even though revenue and earnings were down through the first half of the year, they were still healthy at $4.52 billion and $748.4 million.   NVR stock is up nearly 33% year-to-date (YTD) and 130% over the past five years. The median analyst target price is $6,750, 11% higher than where it’s currently trading.Story continuesAmeriprise Financial (AMP)A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.Source: ShutterstockAmeriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) announced an additional $3.5 billion share repurchase at the end of July. The financial services company’s share repurchase program expires on Sept. 30, 2025. Including the $500 million still available, it has $4 billion on its stock buybacks authorization. The company also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35 a share. The May 2023 payment raised the quarterly dividend by 8.0% from $1.25. The annual rate of $5.40 yields 1.6%.    On the same day it announced its share repurchase addition, it released its Q2 2023 results. Its adjusted operating EPS in the second quarter was $7.44, 30% higher than a year earlier. Its operating earnings were higher due to a strong showing from its Advice &amp; Wealth Management segment, which grew adjusted operating net revenues by 14% over last year with a 49% increase in adjusted operating earnings. It paid out $146 million and $492 million in dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. AMP stock is up 8.25% YTD, about half the performance of the S&amp;P 500. However, it’s up 136.8% over the past five years, 2.6x the index.Morgan Stanley (MS)The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has generously returned capital to shareholders in 2023. On June 30, the investment bank and wealth management firm announced that its board had authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program with no expiration.The dividend was raised 9.7% to 85 cents a share. The annual rate of $3.40 yields 4.1%. In the year’s first half, Morgan Stanley paid out $2.79 billion in dividends and $2.50 billion for share repurchases. Thanks to the swoon in its share price over the past six months, it’s down 12.5%, its share repurchases from the first half of the year are losing money. It paid an average of $90.29 a share on its buybacks, 8.5% more than its current share price. Analysts are generally enthusiastic about MS stock. Of the 27 who cover it, 16 rate it overweight or an outright buy, with a median target of $100.75. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
