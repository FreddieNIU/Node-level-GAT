Long-term stock investors have had to muddle through challenging macroeconomic headwinds in 2023. High inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures, two government shutdowns averted, and a new war that is fueling concerns about a broader conflict. ', 'Have I missed anything? Probably. 2023 has been a year many investors would like to forget. ', 'It’s times like these when you hear the tongue-in-cheek remarks about 401(k)’s becoming 201(k)’s. But seeing your retirement savings shrink is no laughing matter. ', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s where high-yield blue-chip stocks come in. These stocks are known for their defensive characteristics. They won’t outperform growth stocks when the bulls are pushing the market higher. On the other hand, they tend to perform less badly when the market is in a correction. They won’t be the names that get bragged about on the golf course. But you’ll be glad you own them when it’s time to play pickle ball. ', 'And the real benefit to these stocks is that they pay a dividend which increases your total return.

Biopharmaceutical stocks are consistently affected by short-term news. In the case of AbbVie, the stock is down about 14% in 2023 over concerns of a patent cliff for its flagship drug, Humira.', 'A patent cliff occurs when a drug, like Humira, is subject to competition from generic (and lower cost) brands. However, the impact of that competition is not taking as big of a bite out of Humira sales as feared. Plus, the company is getting strong performance from two new drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. ', 'The message for long-term investors is that with a company like AbbVie, it’s about the pipeline. AbbVie has a deep one that should continue to reward investors for years. ', 'The five-year total return on ABBV stock is 92.81%. That means $1,000 invested in 2018 would be worth 1,920,81. Part of that total return comes from the company’s dividend which currently yields 4.3% and has a $5.92 annual payout per share, for now. AbbVie is a Dividend King which means it’s increased its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. ', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been a tough stock for long-term investors in the last five years. The total return on JNJ stock has been just 17.7%. At a little over 3% a year, that hasn’t been keeping up with inflation.', 'There are reasons for that. The company has been trying to reach a settlement in its talc lawsuit. But even when it does, investors will wait to see the effect on the company’s bottom line. ', 'The company also completed a spinoff of its consumer health brands division that will allow it to focus on its core business.

But with the lawsuit issue mostly behind it and the company becoming more streamlined, it’s not hard to imagine the stock will perform much better in the next five years. That will give long-term investors a reason beyond the dividend to be glad they own the stock.

These are names your grandparents held in their retirement accounts. And Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is a top name to consider.

The number of people who are moving or have already moved to the Sunshine State gives you an idea of the customer base that the utility will have in coming years.', 'The total return for DUK stock in the last five years is 26.3%. And when you consider that Duke’s dividend yield is 4.63%, you know that is where investors are getting most of their growth. Still, at a time when many companies are warning of a profit recession, Duke projects 5% to 7% EPS growth through 2027 that will put a floor on DUK stock.

That brings us to the Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). The midstream company is one of the leading distributors of natural gas in the country. The company’s operations span 30,000 miles in 25 states. ', 'And that’s just in the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, CEO Alan Armstrong, said the company is well positioned to handle the expected surge in natural gas demand in coming years whether in the U.S. or abroad.', 'Williams Companies has a five-year total return of 93.37%. That’s a 930.37 increase to a $1,000 investment. And there’s reason to believe that kind of performance is sustainable. Williams has paid a quarterly dividend for more than 50 years. That dividend currently yields 5.14%. This is a stock that’s about as steady as it gets. The company has a forward P/E of just 17x earnings. ', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'Another area where you can look for defensive stocks is in consumer staples. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) may not fit the classic definition of a staples stock. But don’t tell that to shareholders. The company continues to deliver quarter after quarter. ', 'The main takeaway for investors is the company’s pricing power. As inflation has run hot, Pepsi has shown the ability to pass along at least a portion of its costs. That’s supported earnings growth which Pepsi is happy to return to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. ', 'You can flip a coin and land on Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) here. Or heck, just own both. But if you have to pick just one, PEP stock looks like a better choice in terms of total return. You’re getting high single-digit stock price growth over the last five years and a dividend with a yield of 3.03% and a payout of $5.06 per share annually. That works out to a 65% total return in the last five years. ', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a conservative play among semiconductor stocks.

Not surprisingly, so is TXN stock which is down over 8% in 2024.', 'But this is about long-term growth, and that’s where the company shines. In the past', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to high-yield blue-chip stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) come to mind.

Nonetheless, industry players are well-poised to gain from solid momentum in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), auto, connected devices, virtual reality and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the long run. These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering computer storage product requirements. These factors are favorable for prominent industry players like NetApp NTAP, Western Digital WDC, Pure Storage PSTG and Teradata TDC. The democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G will likely act as a tailwind for industry participants. The rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).

The accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance have led to a data explosion for enterprises.', 'Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Broader storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth owing to a rapid increase in data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, a positive for industry players.', 'Macro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending in the Near Term: Weakening IT spending amid global macroeconomic weakness is likely to remain a headwind in the near term. Increased budget scrutiny, especially cloud-cost optimization by clients and forex volatility, are affecting the top-line performance of the industry participants. Consumer spending cuts on purchasing PCs, tablets and printers will likely hinder IT spending growth.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global hospitality sector in 2023, go directly and see 10 Least-Welcoming Countries in the World.', 'The global hospitality industry is valued at $4.6 trillion as of 2023 and is expected to rise to $5.8 trillion by 2027, marking a CAGR of 5.5%.\xa0 According to a market report by CBRE, the rebound of global travel patterns are expected to normalize hotel market fundamentals to pre-pandemic levels in 2024.\xa0 The relaxation of travel restrictions in China and Japan, alongside a resurging Chinese economic outlook, is forecasted to return APAC region RevPAR (revenue per available room) to pre-pandemic levels in 2024. According to an analysis by Forbes, hotel wages have risen more than 19% from 2020 to 2023 even in some of the least-welcoming countries in the world, making the industry a more attractive first-choice prospect for college graduates looking to join the workforce. Market performance of the global hospitality sector has surpassed other competing industries like technology and retail with the gap increasing in the latter half of 2023. The post-pandemic demand for travel remains substantial which should drive continued growth in 2024, with RevPAR up more than 8.3% in 2023 from 2019 in the US. RevPAR exceeded GDP growth within the current economic cycle and overall, the hospitality industry looks poised for a strong year in 2024. Some of the largest players in the hospitality industry are Marriott International (NYSE:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM).', 'According to Ernst and Young, this rampant growth within the hospitality sector is largely owing to the recovery of business travel globally as companies ramp up travel budgets. The frequency and popularity of trade shows and conferences post the pandemic points to the pent-up demand which persists across industries. Certain analysts cited the growth of the work-from-home segment in recent years as a cautionary note for the hotel industry in coming years; however, it has since become apparent that the growth in the work-from-home segment has been an essential proponent of the resurgence of the hospitality industry as employees are now building their travel plans around both business and leisure. ""Bleisure travel"", where business executives add a day or some budget extra time in their work trip for sightseeing or other kinds of leisure activity. Hence, these developments in the market points to increased revenue and continued recovery of the global hospitality sector in 2024 even in the least-welcoming countries in the world. You can read more on the resurgence of the travel industry in our article 12 Best Travel Stocks to Buy Right Now.', 'During the COVID-19 lockdowns, hotel staff around the world were forced to stay home, with more than seventy percent of hotel staff facing massive layoffs in the United States. During the pandemic, numerous hospitality workers reevaluated their career paths and work-life balance and have since opted for employment opportunities which offer increased flexibility or higher pay such as retail, e-commerce, or warehousing. This has presented the global hotel industry with a massive problem post-pandemic, with many companies now struggling to restore their labor pools especially in some of the least-welcoming countries in the world. According to a survey by the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA), more than 87% of hotels in the United States have reported that they are battling severe staff shortages. 45 percent of hotels highlighted housekeeping roles as being the most critically understaffed. According to the survey, similar labor pool insufficiencies are hindering operations in hotels across the United States as employment in the hospitality industry significantly plummeted by almost 400,000 jobs between 2020 and 2023, with more than one in 20 vacancies still remaining unfilled.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, this stark labor shortage presents countless opportunities to companies like Marriott International (NYSE:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) to pursue innovative methods to fill job openings and overcome the global talent crisis which persists in some of the least-welcoming countries in the world. One of the primary methods companies can use is to use standardized activity-based metrics to predict frontline coverage requirements. The report points out that hotels tend to predicate recruitment based on average weekly occupancy which does not reflect actual need since occupancy is extremely volatile and fluctuates frequently. Alternatively, companies could expand occupancy metrics to include specific criteria, like the frequency of check-ins and check-outs, or the number of tables seated at the hotel restaurant.', 'Other innovative practice that companies could use is to redesign and revamp employment roles to combine similar jobs. Conventional hotel recruitment tends to include a variety of roles with clear delineations between managers and frontline employees.\xa0 Each discipline such as housekeeping, front-desk, and maintenance boast different career pathways to promotion. However, to ramp up resilience in times of adversity, companies could revamp job descriptions in a way where a smaller workforce is needed to perform the same number and quality of tasks. This could entail merging similar roles or cross-training staff, the latter allowing for the possibility for staff to occasionally switch roles accordingly. Furthermore, hotel companies could also curate job networks across properties, with roles staffed to cover an extensive network of sites rather than just one location, especially in companies which have a centralized administration for functions like legal, accounting, and human resource. This approach could prove to be fruitful for a variety of different jobs like office support, frontline staff, specialized positions, and management in some of the least-welcoming countries in the world.', 'According to an interview of senior Accor executives by McKinsey, the hotel guest experience in the 2030s is likely to entail a variant of augmented hospitality, where the hotel becomes more than a mere place to stay. Hotels will be looking to move away from their current position as part of a travel experience; alternatively, they are shifting to become locations people can enjoy even if they reside within the same neighborhood. This hybrid model is an important and growing trend within the global hotel industry, with companies like Marriott International (NYSE:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) racing to optimize and drive the industry-wide shift in efforts to maximize profitability and enhance resilience to tourism disruptions in the future, especially in some of the least-welcoming countries in the world.\xa0', ""Furthermore, with a massive rebound in business travel, companies are on the brink of reaching pre-pandemic levels of business. However, there is a massive shift in the nature of business travel with 'bleisure travel' overtaking the former. Within the next decade, hotel managers are expecting that all different elements of life - business, private life, play, culinary experiences, friendship reunions -\xa0 will intertwine in an unprecedented manner. This has led to hotels around the world increasing investments in multipurpose rooms and spaces where guests can simultaneously work, eat, and socially connect throughout the day. Hotels are also recognizing the need for rooms to be more dynamic and potentially transforming within minutes from small in-person meeting rooms to areas fit for proper, professional video conferencing."", 'Moreover, these transformations are likely to affect the very design of hotels in the next decade. According to Accor executive Damien Perrot:', '""Sustainability is the starting point of everything we do concerning design. When we talk about sustainability, we are talking about not just reducing the carbon footprint and energy consumption but also improving the quality of work for the employees—so ergonomics is also very important to integrate into design. Sometimes, design becomes a word that just means, “It looks nice.” But it’s much more than that: design is a tool which, when used properly, can make a property very efficient in terms of guest experience, employee experience, and sustainability. In the 2030s, the design and architecture of hotels will be completely different. Biophilic design, which increases connectivity to the natural environment, will completely shape the future of hospitality. A range of technologies, many of which already exist today, will be integrated into hotels to make them more self-sufficient.""', 'You can read more on the transformational shifts within the global tourism industry in our coverage of the 40 Most Visited Cities in the World in 2023.', 'Photo by Samuel Regan-Asante on Unsplash', ""To compile our list of the 40 least-welcoming countries in the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources to determine which countries have exhibited the least amount of hospitality (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

XYL acquired mission-critical water treatment solutions and services provider, Evoqua, in May 2023. Evoqua’s advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities and exposure to key industrial markets complement Xylem’s portfolio of solutions across the water cycle.

(NYSE:MSCI)]. It is a framework that classifies and categorizes companies into different industry groups based on their primary business activities. The GICS has a hierarchical structure with four tiers, which are sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries, written in order.\xa0', 'According to GICS, there are 11 sectors, which include energy, materials, industrials, consumer discretionary, consumer cyclical, healthcare, financials, information technology, communication services, utilities, and real estate. These sectors are further divided into 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries.', 'In 2023, the technology sector took the whole market by storm. Generative AI trends proved to be quite beneficial for the sector. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 37.34% year-to-date (YTD), compared to 19.15% YTD gains of the S&P 500 index on November 22. However, it is important to note that these gains are attributed to the companies that fall within the communication services and IT sectors. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) is up nearly 50% YTD. Among the tech stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the performer of the year as the company touched the trillion-dollar market cap mark at the end of May, and its stock price is up over 240% YTD.', 'The worst-performing sectors have been healthcare and utilities. The healthcare sector is down 7.46 % YTD, while the utilities sector showed a decline of -5.90%. As per our previous report, the solar power segment among the utilities sector has been one of the worst performing industries in the market, as Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) was down nearly 45% by the end of October. Nevertheless, November has been a better month for the industry as the ETF has gained around 6.5% since our article was posted. The financial sector hasn’t performed well either in the growing interest rate environment. Even though the sector as a whole still has positive YTD growth, the banking industry was hit quite roughly in 2023 due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) is down nearly 24%. Similar to the Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS), the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) has also made significant gains in November as the fund is up 11.32% month-to-date.', 'In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 gained nearly 16.4%, including an 8% gain in the second quarter. These gains proved to be damaging for pessimistic investors. The “Big Short” investor, Michael Burry shorted the stock market in Q2 and placed an $887 million bet against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and $738 million against Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the NASDAQ 100. The investor closed these positions in the third quarter after a probable 40% loss. Nevertheless, Burry found new targets to short in the third quarter, and he opened $47.365 million worth of PUT options against the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF and $7.709 million against Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG).', 'Compared to the first half of the year, the third quarter was less than favorable for the stock market. While the S&P 500 was up 3.11% in July, August and September showed declines of 1.77% and 4.87%, respectively. The total Q3 decline for the S&P 500 was recorded at 3.65%. It further declined by 2.20% in October but is up 7.52% month-to-date on November 22. Energy was the best-performing sector in Q3 due to an increase in prices caused by OPEC and Russia supply cuts and geopolitical tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up nearly 11.4% in the quarter. Two of the best-performing energy stocks were Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), gaining nearly 30% and 26%, respectively.', 'However, the rest of the market did not perform well. The real estate sector has been one of the worst performing sectors throughout the year and declined by 9.7% in the third quarter, while the utilities sector was down 10.1%. Even the Invesco QQQ ETF, which has been performing really well across the year and is up 47.5% YTD, declined by 3% in the third quarter.', 'According to a Bloomberg report, Bank of America believes that the S&P 500 index will rise around 10% from November 22 levels by the end of 2024 and close at a record 5,000.

Goldman Sachs has a slightly better outlook at 4,700. Wells Fargo has a target between 4,600 to 4,800, and UBS keeps it at 4,700 by the end of next year.', 'Keeping the market conditions and forecasts in perspective, some of the best stocks to buy from different sectors include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

American Tower is a REIT (real estate investment trust) that owns and leases antennae space on cell towers while Digital Bridge is an investment manager that invests in the digital infrastructure space. Both companies require debt in their operations and the prospect of higher interest rates continues to impact share prices in the short term.', 'As an aside, American Tower is not a new holding of Andvari. We’ve owned it in the past. Although we may have started putting American Tower back into client portfolios a bit early, we believe shares are extremely attractive. First, the shares trade at a current 3.8% dividend yield at the end of October. This yield is near the highest in American’s entire history as a public company. Second, the company will likely grow dividends per share by 9% annually over the long term.

Dividend yield is another key aspect of dividend investing that holds significant popularity. Investors keen on income often look for stocks with attractive dividend yields, as it indicates how much cash flow they will receive relative to their investment.', ""A healthy range for dividend yields can vary based on factors like the industry, economic conditions, and the specific company's stability. Typically, dividend yields falling between 3% to 6% are considered a good balance between generating meaningful income and indicating a company's ability to sustain and grow dividends. However, excessively high yields, say over 8% or 10%, might signal potential risks such as an unsustainable payout or market concerns about the company's future performance. However, this doesn't apply to numerous companies that provide higher-than-average dividend yields while upholding a robust history of consistent dividend payments. Take, for instance, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD), all boasting yields exceeding 7% while also consistently increasing their dividend payouts."", ""The Wellington research showed how well stocks with high dividends performed in the past. The study looked at S&P 500 stocks that pay dividends and divided them into five groups based on their dividend and yields. The top 20% of dividend payers formed the first group, while the lowest payers and non-payers made up the fifth group. They tracked how these groups performed in each decade from 1930 to 2019. What they found was that the second group, with moderate dividend payouts, did better than the S&P 500 in seven out of nine periods. The first and third groups were next, performing similarly and outperforming the index in six out of nine periods. However, the fourth and fifth groups didn't do as well, outperforming the index only four times each."", 'Other reports, like the Wellington study, have shown the strong performance of high-dividend stocks. Our article titled 11 Best High-Dividend Stocks to Buy Now delved into more recent research, confirming that stocks with high dividends are still valuable. A 2020 study from the Centre for Endowment Asset Management and the University of North Carolina supported this idea. It covered nearly a century of data, from July 1928 to June 2019 in the US market, and found that portfolios with higher dividend yields provided better returns for investors. These portfolios outperformed those with low or no dividends by a significant margin: 199 basis points better than low-yield portfolios and 330 basis points better than zero-yield portfolios.', 'Photo by Dan Dennis on Unsplash', 'In this article, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks with yields above 6%.', 'Our Methodology:', ""For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q3 2023 and picked dividend stocks that have yields above 6%, as of November 23.

Shares have added about 4.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.', ""Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers."", 'Archer Daniels Midland Company posted third-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but the bottom line beat the same. Both metrics declined year over year.Adjusted earnings of $1.63 per share in the third quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50. However, the figure declined 12.4% from $1.86 in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were $1.52 per share, down 16.9% from the prior-year quarter’s $1.83.Revenues fell 12.1% year over year to $21,695 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,217 million.Segment-wise, revenues for Ag Services & Oilseeds fell 13.9% year over year, whereas Carbohydrate Solutions’ revenues dropped 7.1% year over year. Also, Nutrition witnessed a year-over-year revenue decline of 4.3%.Meanwhile, we projected revenues for Ag Services & Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solution segments to decline by 7.8% and 0.5%, respectively.The gross profit decreased marginally year over year to $1,810 million but exceeded our estimate of $1,478.1 million. Meanwhile, the gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter under review. The metric fared better than our estimate of 6.4%. SG&A expenses fell 0.4% to $815 million.Archer Daniels has reported an adjusted segmental operating profit of $1,492 million in third-quarter 2023, down 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, ADM’s segmental operating profit fell 8.9% year over year to $1,421 million.', 'Adjusted operating profit for Ag Services & Oilseeds fell 21.1% year over year to $848 million. This is mainly due to weak North America origination results, which were hurt by lower export volumes due to large South America supplies. However, South America origination results have been solid, driven by higher volumes and margins stemming from strong export demand. The segment benefited from its strong Brazilian export capabilities and the commissioning of the Spiritwood production facility to serve the high demand for renewable green diesel.Crushing results declined year over year, driven by a drab year-over-year performance in global soy crush margins. On the flip side, robust soft seed margins, driven by the use of its flex capacity in EMEA, acted as upsides.Refined Products and Other results have been robust year over year, benefiting from strong export demand for biodiesel and domestic demand for food oil in EMEA. As noted, there were net positive mark-to-market timing effects during the quarter.The Carbohydrate Solutions segment’s adjusted operating profit increased 48.9% to $460 million. The Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, gained from solid demand as well as robust volumes and higher margins in North America. Meanwhile, the global wheat milling business witnessed higher margins, driven by solid demand.Vantage Corn Processors’ results have been higher year-over-year, driven by strong demand and margins for ethanol.In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $138 million fell 22% from $177 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit’s results were lower year over year. The Flavors unit was robust on pricing actions in EMEA and had solid win rates in North America. Muted demand for plant-based proteins, particularly in the meat alternatives category, hurt the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health & Wellness business’ results was strong year over year, backed by solid probiotic sales and a favorable impact associated with the revised commercial agreement with Spiber.The Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower contributions from amino acids. Also, continued demand fulfillment challenges in Pet Solutions acted as a deterrent.', 'The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,498 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,225 million; and shareholders’ equity of $25,265 million. As of Sep 30, 2023, ADM provided $1,891 million in cash for operating activities.

If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 16% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', 'While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.04 total annually to $1.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 38% over that duration. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.', 'Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Global Payments has seen earnings per share falling at 2.9% per year over the last five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.', ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Paying Over 6%.\xa0', 'Dividends are crucial in investing because they provide investors with consistent income. They have played a big role in boosting the overall returns of the market. Looking at the S&P 500 Index from 1960, about 69% of its total return comes from reinvested dividends and the magic of compound interest, as reported by Hartford Funds. Essentially, this process creates a snowball effect, enabling investors to benefit not just from the dividends themselves but also from the growth of those reinvested dividends over time. Dividend yield is another key aspect of dividend investing that holds significant popularity. Investors keen on income often look for stocks with attractive dividend yields, as it indicates how much cash flow they will receive relative to their investment.', ""A healthy range for dividend yields can vary based on factors like the industry, economic conditions, and the specific company's stability. Typically, dividend yields falling between 3% to 6% are considered a good balance between generating meaningful income and indicating a company's ability to sustain and grow dividends. However, excessively high yields, say over 8% or 10%, might signal potential risks such as an unsustainable payout or market concerns about the company's future performance. However, this doesn't apply to numerous companies that provide higher-than-average dividend yields while upholding a robust history of consistent dividend payments. Take, for instance, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD), all boasting yields exceeding 7% while also consistently increasing their dividend payouts."", ""The Wellington research showed how well stocks with high dividends performed in the past. The study looked at S&P 500 stocks that pay dividends and divided them into five groups based on their dividend and yields. The top 20% of dividend payers formed the first group, while the lowest payers and non-payers made up the fifth group. They tracked how these groups performed in each decade from 1930 to 2019. What they found was that the second group, with moderate dividend payouts, did better than the S&P 500 in seven out of nine periods. The first and third groups were next, performing similarly and outperforming the index in six out of nine periods. However, the fourth and fifth groups didn't do as well, outperforming the index only four times each."", 'Other reports, like the Wellington study, have shown the strong performance of high-dividend stocks.

If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Newmont paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 182%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high.

Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season. Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.', ""WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?"", 'Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued. Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.', '""What we know is Black Friday, because it\'s so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.', ""WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR? Several major retailers from Dollar General to Walmart and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites."", ""Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom compared to last year."", 'Online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture, according to data from Adobe Analytics.', ""WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR? IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15.

Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel\'s ""Spider-Man 2"", though the retailer on Tuesday forecast a bigger decline in annual comparable sales and pointed to ""difficult to predict"" consumer demand.', 'Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.', 'ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR? Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.', 'But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year.

Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans\' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to Adobe.', 'WHAT ARE RETAILERS\' PLANS THIS YEAR? Retailers including Best Buy, Macy\'s, H&M and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu were touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores. Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it. Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.', 'ARE DISRUPTIONS EXPECTED DURING THANKSGIVING WEEKEND?', 'High-profile', 'Amazon workers in more than a dozen U.S. warehouses are striking on Black Friday, in a fight for higher wages, improved environmental efforts and tax payments to Europe.

That is less than a fourth of the $156.4 billion that shoppers spent during that ended on Nov. 11, according to data provider', 'Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe.', 'In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.', 'WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS? With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.', 'Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?"", 'Macy\'s CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday.

To put this growth into perspective, a Bloomberg report suggests that the entire travel industry is expected to be worth $15.5 trillion in 2033. According to a World Food Travel Association (WFTA) report, food is a factor that travelers financially prioritize the most. WFTA says that 53% of leisure travelers are food travelers. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) mentioned several economic and environmental benefits of gastronomy tourism in its report:', '“Food experiences can also stimulate local development, because food tourism is high yield tourism that can extend the tourist season and diversify rural economies. Food experiences are labour intensive and create jobs while creating backward linkages that stimulate agriculture, and they generally do not require major new investments. Food can contribute to regional attractiveness, sustain the local environment and cultural heritage, and strengthen local identities and sense of community.”', 'Due to the growing trend of food tourism, the hospitality sector is also taking necessary steps to cater to gastronomical tourists. For example, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is offering sustainable culinary vacations and providing farm-to-table experiences at its restaurants in several locations.

Moreover, restaurants at Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)’s hotel chains collectively had 40 Michelin stars in 2022. In 2023, 6 of Marriott’s Hong Kong and Macau restaurants received Michelin stars.', 'Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is another travel and hospitality company that offers some of the highest quality food through its restaurants. The MICHELIN Guide Hong Kong & Macau 2023 revealed that four restaurants developed by Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) received seven Michelin stars. The two Michelin-starred, Wing Lei at Wynn Macau achieved Michelin recognition for 14 straight years.', 'The Michelin Guide has been the absolute authority in determining dining quality at a restaurant. The Michelin Guide team selects restaurants to be visited by their inspectors. Michelin inspectors remain anonymous and are even discouraged from telling their friends and family about what they do. When several inspectors eat at a specific restaurant, they analyze its quality together and may award it one to three stars, if it deserves any. According to the guide, one star means ""high-quality cooking,"" two stars mean ""excellent cooking, worth a detour!"" and three stars mean ""exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey!""', 'Joël Robuchon was considered the ""Chef of the Century"" during his lifetime and his restaurants held more Michelin stars than any other person alive or dead.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank, some relevant news, and a primer on value investing, then you can skip ahead to\xa0Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. ', ""Value investing is one of the more popular approaches among professional investors, and its fundamentals are also among those that are commonly understood by the general public. While most people might be unaware of using puts and calls to make a stock market return, they are likely to understand that one way to profit from the market is through share price appreciation. However, while share price appreciation is one part of value investing fundamentals, simply relying on it alone is not using value investing. This is because the two central components of this philosophy are fair value and the margin of safety. The fair value is the assumed 'true value' of a stock that an investor calculates based on several factors such as business operations and future cash flows. Then, the margin of safety compares the fair value of a stock and its market share price to see whether there is a risk of substantial losses due to share price depreciation after a purchase is made. Stocks with higher margins of safety are 'safer' as intuition would suggest. "", 'The philosophy of value investing has been in the market and academia for more than five decades now. Over the course of this time period, it has produced some of the richest people in the world, in perhaps what is the biggest testament to its strength. Some of the biggest names in the finance and hedge fund industry, such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Leon Cooperman and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, are known adherents of the value investing approach. With the third quarter hedge fund filing season now over, their latest stock picks are also available.', ""We've taken a look at all these investors' latest picks too.

The GICS has a hierarchical structure with four tiers, which are sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries, written in order.\xa0', 'According to GICS, there are 11 sectors, which include energy, materials, industrials, consumer discretionary, consumer cyclical, healthcare, financials, information technology, communication services, utilities, and real estate. These sectors are further divided into 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries.', 'In 2023, the technology sector took the whole market by storm. Generative AI trends proved to be quite beneficial for the sector. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 37.34% year-to-date (YTD), compared to 19.15% YTD gains of the S&P 500 index on November 22. However, it is important to note that these gains are attributed to the companies that fall within the communication services and IT sectors. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) is up nearly 50% YTD. Among the tech stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the performer of the year as the company touched the trillion-dollar market cap mark at the end of May, and its stock price is up over 240% YTD.', 'The worst-performing sectors have been healthcare and utilities. The healthcare sector is down 7.46 % YTD, while the utilities sector showed a decline of -5.90%. As per our previous report, the solar power segment among the utilities sector has been one of the worst performing industries in the market, as Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) was down nearly 45% by the end of October. Nevertheless, November has been a better month for the industry as the ETF has gained around 6.5% since our article was posted. The financial sector hasn’t performed well either in the growing interest rate environment. Even though the sector as a whole still has positive YTD growth, the banking industry was hit quite roughly in 2023 due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) is down nearly 24%. Similar to the Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS), the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) has also made significant gains in November as the fund is up 11.32% month-to-date.', 'In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 gained nearly 16.4%, including an 8% gain in the second quarter. These gains proved to be damaging for pessimistic investors. The “Big Short” investor, Michael Burry shorted the stock market in Q2 and placed an $887 million bet against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and $738 million against Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the NASDAQ 100. The investor closed these positions in the third quarter after a probable 40% loss. Nevertheless, Burry found new targets to short in the third quarter, and he opened $47.365 million worth of PUT options against the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF and $7.709 million against Booking Holdings Inc.

It further declined by 2.20% in October but is up 7.52% month-to-date on November 22. Energy was the best-performing sector in Q3 due to an increase in prices caused by OPEC and Russia supply cuts and geopolitical tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up nearly 11.4% in the quarter. Two of the best-performing energy stocks were Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), gaining nearly 30% and 26%, respectively.', 'However, the rest of the market did not perform well.

To skip our detailed analysis of the future of the global clean energy and sustainability industry in 2024, go directly and see 5 Most Climatically Diverse Countries in the World.', '2023 saw the global renewable energy industry facing considerable headwinds in the aftermath of skyrocketing costs, project delays driven by supply chain disruptions, uncertainty in global trade policy, rising inflation and interest rates, and numerous interconnection delays. According to a report by Deloitte, some of these challenges are likely to seep into 2024 as well, exacerbating current headwinds. However, the report also highlights that growth is expected to accelerate at unprecedented levels, powered by strong demand and the numerous clean energy incentives put forth in the Inflation Reduction Act. Although skyrocketing demand could exacerbate supply chain turbulence and interconnection bottlenecks thereby further causing prices to rise, there are certain evolving trends which are likely to aid the industry in navigating and mitigating these headwinds to set the stage for faster growth in 2024 especially in most climatically diverse countries in the world. Most prominently, the marked increase in clean energy component manufacturing has the potential to streamline supply chain entanglements over time. Furthermore, with the industry directing a greater amount of focus to increasing cybersecurity and averseness to risk, the road to more effective profitability seems to be much more pronounced. Lastly, the IRA incentivizes renewable energy providers to increase investment in pursuing greater opportunities in low-income communities expanding the market for clean energy and increasing demand. According to McKinsey, renewable energy is set to make up a large proportion of the power mix as early as 2050, expected to make up for 85% of total energy generation. Some of the largest players in the clean energy sector are NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG). To read more on the clean energy sector, check out our coverage of Top 20 Renewable Energy Companies in the World.', 'With an increasingly turbulent macroeconomic outlook even in some of the most climatically diverse countries in the world, all affected industries are struggling to adapt, with energy companies in particular facing a variety of macroeconomic and energy-specific disruptions. These tend to include a marked increase in commodity prices, rising pressure to curtail the carbon footprint, and numerous supply chain disruptions. It is a well established fact that energy companies which create and pursue innovative opportunities during times of crisis are more likely to increase profitability and keep operations afloat. However, this usually requires a cognitive shift from merely adjusting to volatility to identifying and capitalizing upon the many opportunities presented in\xa0climatically diverse countries in the world. This requires capturing larger, predominant trends and understanding additional risks. According to a recent report by McKinsey, the global transition to cleaner sources of energy presents enormous opportunities for energy companies in Europe to pivot their domestic renewable energy production.', 'However, the report also highlights that the estimated expenditure required to make this transition by 2050 is estimated to be around $5.3 trillion, particularly as it relates to upgrading and renovating power grids, installing baseload power with hydro pump storage plants, and installing smarter technology in homes and offices for heating and cooling. Companies like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) are gearing up to play defense and curate an effective risk management approach before resorting to an offensive business strategy. In this vein, these companies are creating transparency around risks by building appropriate heat maps which they can then use to break down risks and assess a prioritization mechanism. Additionally, heat maps shed light upon the entire trajectory of a specific action, highlighting how certain actions can lead to risks that were hitherto unrecognized.', 'Secondly, companies are increasing their overall reliance on quantitative modelling. Heat maps merely tend to provide an arbitrary picture of portfolio risk. Companies complement this by engaging in quantitative modelling which can showcase the entire distribution of risk and effectively curate a dynamic portrait. The quantification of risk is undoubtedly a complicated process but it is made possible via high-level outside-in analytics. The resultant models can aid in the overall understanding of executives and leaders in relation to their investment strategies. Once these quantified models are implemented, relevant scenarios can be applied to the portfolio, whilst considering their effect on company finances. Furthermore, expert predictions can go hand-in-hand with digital simulations to best imitate real-world complications that tend to arise in some of the most climatically diverse countries in the world. The likely impact of this kind of stress testing can outline the possibilities of disruption whilst purporting possible mitigation strategies. To read more on how energy companies can navigate the precarious macroeconomic challenges, check out our coverage of the 30 Countries with the Cleanest Air in the World.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, companies are struggling to find and retain competent employees, partly due to the Great Attrition. Since April 2022, more than 24 million workers in the US have been forced out their jobs, with more than forty percent globally claiming that they are likely to vacate their current position of employment by January 2024. Numerous companies across industries, particularly the renewable energy sector, find this an incredibly complex problem, especially since the clean energy segment requires a significant amount of technical expertise and experience especially in some of the more climatically diverse countries in the world. Furthermore, the pressure seems to be exacerbating as skyrocketing demand is causing a rapid growth in the clean energy industry, with McKinsey estimating the global installed capacity of solar and onshore and offshore wind projects will have tripled by 2030. Hence, as demand for cleaner energy reaches an all-time high, there is also an internal demand of qualified development and construction employees, operations workers, and maintenance employees.', 'To mitigate and fill current talent gaps in order to capitalize on the growing industry, top players like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) must invest in a strong brand image to attract the top talent. It is within the best interests of these companies to control market perception. Global players tend to underestimate the value of regional branding in their home countries, which is an essential precondition to attracting the best employees. Furthermore, companies will need to create and propagate clear career path development, especially for key employment positions. A lack of career development opportunity is a major cause of an employee outflow, with employees who can visualize a future within the company much more likely to stay and compete. The oil and gas industry has been facilitating exploration and production development in employees for decades and it is time for the renewable energy sector to follow suit. Clean energy companies also need to divert greater investments in structured training to attract and retain key blue-collar operatives within the company. Employers need to expand beyond wages and utilize relevant training programs which focus on clear, long-term career progression especially for roles which are temporary.', 'Photo by onur ozkardes on Unsplash', 'To create our list of the 20 most climatically diverse countries in the world, we used the Köppen climate classification system to identify the major climate zones across the world.

Then we accumulated climate data for each country using different reliable sources like global meteorological organizations (1, 2), climate research organizations (1, 2), and local meteorological departments.

Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 35% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see QUALCOMM has grown its earnings rapidly, up 34% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, QUALCOMM has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", ""Is QUALCOMM an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? QUALCOMM has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention."", ""On that note, you'll want to research what risks QUALCOMM is facing. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM and you should be aware of them before buying any shares."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

They prioritize a productive workspace, reliable internet, and co-working facilities, while also seeking opportunities for leisure. This lifestyle choice involves a thorough evaluation of various factors, such as the cost of living, time zone differences, and accessibility to essential amenities. Ultimately, the location that a digital nomad selects plays a significant role in their professional success and enhances their overall enjoyment of diverse cultures and new experiences.', ""The COVID-19 pandemic brought quite an evolution to digital nomadism. Initially, it was embraced by traditional remote workers, but it has now become a diverse landscape, with varying numbers and preferences of people opting for a location-independent way of life. As the line between remote and office-based work becomes hazy and the world adapts to the new normal, the digital nomad community's narrative has taken interesting turns, reflecting shifts in work preferences, travel inclinations, and the balance between independence and traditional employment."", ""According to a report released in August by MBO Partners, during the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional workers, those employed by organizations, experienced newfound freedom as they transitioned away from office-based work, resulting in a more than tripled number of digital nomads with traditional jobs since the pandemic's onset in 2020."", 'However, in 2023, there was a 4% decline in the number of American digital nomads holding traditional jobs. Conversely, the count of digital nomads operating as independent workers, including freelancers and self-employed individuals, continued to rise, marking a significant 14% increase compared to 2022.', ""While many companies have enhanced location flexibility for their employees, allowing remote work, a considerable portion of traditional jobholders is expected to adopt a 'hybrid' approach, spending at least part of their workweek in the office.

Consequently, 53% of digital nomads state their intention to exclusively travel within the US, reflecting a notable increase from the 42% reported in 2022.', 'Digital nomadism has a positive impact on both local economies and global travel trends. As digital nomads explore new places, they tend to contribute to the local economies by spending money in the places they visit. Many countries have recognized this potential and introduced digital nomad visas to attract them, thereby promoting economic growth in various regions. Furthermore, the presence of digital nomads often leads to the development of niche markets or services catering to their specific needs, highlighting the adaptability and influence of this lifestyle on a global scale.', ""MBO Partners' same report, State of Independence: Nomadism Enters the Mainstream, also notes that 36% of American digital nomads plan to spend more time in the US next year and less time abroad. Additionally, while 47% intend to engage in some international travel, only 10% plan to spend the entire year outside the US."", 'The study reveals a shift in digital nomad behavior towards visiting fewer locations but staying longer at each stop. Nearly half of digital nomads express an inclination toward this approach for the next year, termed ""slowmad"" travel, citing benefits such as a more active social life, deeper cultural understanding, reduced travel stress, and improved work productivity. With digital nomadism becoming increasingly mainstream, 17.3 million Americans, comprising 11% of the workforce in 2023, adopted the digital nomad lifestyle, signifying its increasing popularity and integration into mainstream work culture.', ""Several companies have recognized and capitalized on the growing demand from digital nomads by offering a diverse range of lodging options that cater to their needs. They've adapted their services to accommodate longer stays, offer amenities that remote workers seek, such as reliable internet connections and suitable workspaces, and provide listings in various destinations known to be popular among digital nomads.

If you want to skip our introduction to Paul Tudor Jones and his hedge fund, then take a look at Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. ', ""Paul Tudor Jones is one of the most successful hedge fund bosses in the industry. According to Forbes Magazine, he was worth $8.1 billion as of November 2023, making him one of the richest people in the world. The investor started his journey in the finance industry in 1976 after graduating from the University of Virginia with a bachelor's degree in economics. Mr. Tudor's finance career would start in the commodities market, as he would work as a cotton broker. He would spend more than a decade in this field before finally taking the plunge and setting up Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980."", ""When it comes to making headlines, the first half of Mr. Tudor's investment career is more impressive. This is because he is known as a trend player, or an investor who senses the direction in which financial market winds are blowing and then adjusts his sails accordingly. Seven years after setting up Tudor Investment, Paul Tudor would sense an opportunity before the notorious Black Monday stock market crash of 1987. This crash came after years of bull runs on the stock market that created uncertainty about stocks being overvalued. Investors then started to submit sell orders to exchanges in bulk, and when all of these were executed, the market dropped. Mr. Tudor and his firm anticipated this, and according to some estimates, ended up booking a whopping $100 million in profits. This wouldn't be the hedge fund's last hurrah."", ""A couple of years later Mr. Tudor's knack of sniffing potential overvaluations would return at the precipice of Japan's lost economic decade. This era came after Japan's post war economic boom, which was aided by lax monetary policies that incentivized corporate borrowing and spending to spur economic growth. While this is a good thing for its own sake, its negative consequences came when Japanese asset valuations swelled due to easy access to capital. Sensing impending doom, Japanese authorities started to make changes, that caused the stock market to crash and allowed Mr. Tudor to profit. Back then, as the flagship Japanese Nikkei 225 index dropped by 43% in a single year, Mr. Tudor's fund would go on to post 87% in returns for the year."", ""If you're an avid student of U.S. stock market history and are reading this, then you might know where we're heading next. One of the biggest eras of overvaluation in America was during the time of the dot com bubble. Back then, the Internet was making its way to consumers for the first time, and personal computers were starting to become common. The potential of the Internet to disrupt industries caused ordinary people and seasoned hedge funds to pile into stocks, and most of the time, without the proper due diligence in a classic example of the fear of missing out. Naturally, valuations became overstretched, and when they came tumbling down, Mr. Tudor profited just like he had during Black Monday and the Japanese asset price crash."", ""Post 2001, and particularly after the 2008 Great Recession, Tudor Investment's performance wasn't as eye catching. The post 2008 era was marked by low interest rates and more hedge funds popping up. Yet, it is still one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. Insider Monkey dug through Tudor Investment's SEC filings for Q3 2023 and discovered that its investment portfolio was worth $9.9 billion. These values often include the notional value of options, so the actual dollar amount that the firm had spent on its investment decisions can be lower. Compared to the second quarter, the third quarter portfolio marked a sizeable $1.6 billion growth, and annually, the portfolio has more than doubled in value, since during September 2022 it was worth $4.6 billion."", ""Safe to say, Mr. Tudor has spent most of his time on the front lines for most of the stock market's recent history. This naturally makes it quite crucial that we see what he's up to lately. Today, we decided to see which of Paul Tudor's top stock picks have also seen notable insider buying. Insider purchases lend credibility to a stock's prospects, as these people have the closest exposure to a firm's business and future prospects. Some top stocks in today's list are Nasdaq, Inc.

', ""Value investing is one of the more popular approaches among professional investors, and its fundamentals are also among those that are commonly understood by the general public. While most people might be unaware of using puts and calls to make a stock market return, they are likely to understand that one way to profit from the market is through share price appreciation. However, while share price appreciation is one part of value investing fundamentals, simply relying on it alone is not using value investing. This is because the two central components of this philosophy are fair value and the margin of safety. The fair value is the assumed 'true value' of a stock that an investor calculates based on several factors such as business operations and future cash flows. Then, the margin of safety compares the fair value of a stock and its market share price to see whether there is a risk of substantial losses due to share price depreciation after a purchase is made. Stocks with higher margins of safety are 'safer' as intuition would suggest. "", 'The philosophy of value investing has been in the market and academia for more than five decades now. Over the course of this time period, it has produced some of the richest people in the world, in perhaps what is the biggest testament to its strength. Some of the biggest names in the finance and hedge fund industry, such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Leon Cooperman and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, are known adherents of the value investing approach. With the third quarter hedge fund filing season now over, their latest stock picks are also available.', ""We've taken a look at all these investors' latest picks too. Starting from Mr. Buffett, the top three stocks in the 12 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett are General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Citigroup Inc.

The pills are especially important for South Africa, where TB killed more than 50,000 people in 2021, making it the country’s leading cause of death.', ""In recent months, activists have protested efforts by Johnson & Johnson to protect its patent on the drug. In March, TB patients petitioned the Indian government, calling for cheaper generics; the government ultimately agreed J&J's patent could be broken. Belarus and Ukraine then wrote to J&J, also asking it to drop its patents, but with little response."", 'In July, J&J’s patent on the drug expired in South Africa, but the company had it extended until 2027, enraging activists who accused it of profiteering.', 'The South African government then began investigating the company’s pricing policies. It had been paying about 5,400 rand ($282) per treatment course, more than twice as much as poor countries that got the drug via a global effort called the Stop TB partnership.', 'In September, about a week after South Africa’s probe began, J&J announced that it would drop its patent in more than 130 countries, allowing generic-makers to copy the drug.', '“This addresses any misconception that access to our medicines is limited,” the company said.', ""Christophe Perrin, a TB expert at Doctors Without Borders, called J&J's reversal “a big surprise” because aggressive patent protection was typically a “cornerstone” of pharmaceutical companies' strategy."", 'Meanwhile, in Colombia, the government declared last month that it would issue a compulsory license for the HIV drug dolutegravir without permission from the drug’s patent-holder, Viiv Healthcare. The decision came after more than 120 groups asked the Colombian government to expand access to the WHO-recommended drug.', '“This is Colombia taking the reins after the extreme inequity of COVID and challenging a major pharmaceutical to ensure affordable AIDS treatment for its people,” said Peter Maybarduk of the Washington advocacy group Public Citizen. He noted that Brazilian activists are pushing their government to make a similar move.', 'Still, some experts said much more needs to change before poorer countries can produce their own medicines and vaccines.', 'When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Africa produced fewer than 1% of all vaccines made globally but used more than half of the world’s supply, according to Petro Terblanche, managing director of Afrigen Biologics. The company is part of a WHO-backed effort to produce a COVID vaccine using the same mRNA technology as those made by Pfizer and Moderna.', 'Terblanche estimated about 14 million people died of AIDS in Africa in the late 1990s-2000s, when countries couldn’t get the necessary medicines.', 'Back then, President Nelson Mandela’s government in South Africa eventually suspended patents to allow wider access to AIDS drugs. That prompted more than 30 drugmakers to take it to court in 1998, in a case dubbed “Mandela vs. Big Pharma.”', 'Doctors Without Borders described the episode as “a public relations disaster” for the drug companies, which dropped the lawsuit in 2001.', ""Terblanche said that Africa's past experience during the HIV epidemic has proven instructive."", '“It’s not acceptable for a listed company to hold intellectual property that stands in the way of saving lives and so, we will see more countries fighting back,” she said.', 'Challenging pharmaceutical companies is just one piece to ensuring Africa has equal access to treatments and vaccines, Terblanche said. More robust health systems are critical.', '“If we can’t get (vaccines and medicines) to the people who need them, they aren’t useful,” she said.', ""Yet some experts pointed out that South Africa's own intellectual property laws still haven't been changed sufficiently and make it too easy for pharmaceutical companies to acquire patents and extend their monopolies."", 'While many other developing countries allow legal challenges to a patent or a patent extension, South Africa has no clear law that allows it to do that, said Lynette Keneilwe Mabote-Eyde, a health care activist who consults for the nonprofit Treatment Action Group.', ""The South African department of health didn't respond to a request for comment regarding drug procurement and patents."", ""Andy Gray, who advises the South African government on essential medicines, said J&J's recent decision to not enforce its patent may have more to do with the drug's limited future earnings than caving to pressure from activists."", '""Because bedaquiline is not ever going to sell in huge volumes in high-income countries, it\'s the sort of product they would love to offload at some stage and perhaps earn a royalty from,” said Gray, a senior lecturer in pharmacology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.', ""In its annual report on TB released earlier this month, the World Health Organization said there were more than 10 million people sickened by the disease last year and 1.3 million deaths. After COVID-19, tuberculosis is the world's deadliest infectious disease and it is now the top killer of people with HIV. WHO noted only about 2 in 5 people with drug-resistant TB are being treated."", 'Zolelwa Sifumba, a South African doctor, was diagnosed with drug-resistant TB in 2012 when she was a medical student and endured 18 months of treatment taking about 20 pills every day in addition to daily injections, which left her in “immense pain” and resulted in some hearing loss. Bedaquiline was not rolled out as a standard treatment in South Africa until 2018.', '“I wanted to quit (treatment) every single day,” she said. Since her recovery, Sifumba has become an advocate for better TB treatment, saying it makes little sense to charge poor countries high prices for essential medicines.', '“TB is everywhere but the burden of it is in your lower and middle income countries,” she said. ""If the lower income countries can’t get it (the drug), then what’s the point? Who are you making it for?”', '___', 'Cheng reported from London.', '___', 'AP health coverage: https://apnews.com/health']"

The report highlights a substantial difference between the growth rates of dividends and inflation in the last 20 years. This difference resulted in dividends paid by S&P 500 companies increasing in purchasing power by more than 130%.', 'Dividends have been quite important for investors, especially when overall market returns have been low for a while. Companies that consistently increased dividends or started paying them tend to offer better returns with less volatility compared to companies that kept their dividends the same or reduced them.

As a key player in aerospace and defense, known for iconic creations such as the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber and F-35 Lightning, Northrop Grumman is thriving in the current landscape of escalating global conflicts. Its impressive Q3 earnings report and record-breaking backlog suggest continued favorable conditions, reinforcing my bullish outlook on the stock.', 'Northrop Grumman stands as a significant beneficiary of the current multipolar geopolitical terrain, as the prevalence of wars and conflicts is set to drive growing defense budgets. The company plays a pivotal role in providing mission-critical components such as communication systems, radar systems, unmanned systems, and other weapons systems integral to the U.S. military’s and its allies’ arsenals.', 'With demand for all such systems skyrocketing recently, Northrop Grumman is set to keep winning highly profitable contracts, thus sustaining a robust backlog, moving forward.', 'A noteworthy example of Northrop Grumman’s impact is its involvement in supplying weaponry, such as rocket motors utilized in guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS), to Ukraine through NATO allies. Further, Israel’s Defense Forces (IDF) heavily rely on the company’s advanced F-35 and other missile systems.', 'Therefore, whether Ukraine is drawing on NATO’s resources or the IDF is leveraging proprietary systems and ammunition in the ongoing conflict against Hamas, demand for Northrop’s systems is now on the rise. This inherently translates into a growing stream of upcoming supply orders as Northrop’s clients need to restore their supplies and continue investing in new technologies consistently as they strive to improve their capabilities.', 'As we navigate the current geopolitical terrain, the potential for further instability looms large, with multiple fronts facing looming threats. The possibility of a conflict between China and Taiwan adds to the complexity. Consequently, the rationale behind Northrop Grumman’s investment proposition has lately become increasingly compelling. The company’s most recent results certainly allude to that.', 'As previously noted, the dynamic geopolitical landscape has become a favorable factor for Northrop Grumman, creating positive momentum within the industry. This, in turn, has led to a significant expansion of the company’s order backlog. In its most recent Q3 results, Northrop Grumman successfully leveraged its expanding backlog to achieve excellent financial results.', 'Simultaneously, as the influx of new orders outpaced the rate of deliveries, Northrop’s backlog reached unprecedented record highs at the end of the quarter. Thus, the company raised its Fiscal 2023 guidance, reflecting a heightened sense of optimism from the management team.', 'Notably, in Q3, Northrop continued to build on the momentum from the first half of the year. Achieving an impressive overall sales growth of 9% to reach $9.8 billion, the company’s success was underpinned by substantial improvements across all four segments. Noteworthy is the fact that this quarter marked the second consecutive period of sustained growth in every segment—a testament to Northrop’s adept and positive responsiveness to the prevailing industry tailwinds', 'At the segment level, Aeronautics experienced robust sales growth of 9%, primarily fueled by an increased volume of manned aircraft programs. The Defense Systems segment also witnessed a modest 6% jump in revenues, propelled by sustained excellence in missile defense and armaments portfolios, notably featuring IBCS, GMLRS, and HAKM.', 'In Mission Systems, the Network Information Solutions business spearheaded rapid growth in restricted sales, elevating the segment’s top line by an impressive 7%. Lastly, the Space segment achieved yet another milestone with a remarkable double-digit sales growth, showcasing sustained momentum across various programs.', 'Despite the challenging economic landscape marked by inflationary pressures on most industrial companies, Northrop Grumman has demonstrated resilience with robust sales, maintaining solid margins and achieving a noteworthy 5% increase in its earnings per share (EPS) to $6.18.', 'Adding to the positive outlook, buoyed by a surge in optimism, the company’s management has revised its guidance upwards, anticipating Fiscal 2023 sales to reach approximately $39.0 billion—up from the earlier range of $38.4 billion to $38.8 billion—with an adjusted EPS projection ranging between $22.45 and $22.85.', 'Most importantly, the spotlight falls on Northrop’s remarkable backlog, a key indicator pointing to promising future results. Closing the quarter with a backlog of $83.9 billion, reflecting a 7% increase from the previous year, the company enjoys exceptional cash-flow visibility. Considering its annual revenues nearing $39.0 billion, this substantial backlog positions Northrop Grumman for continued stellar top-line growth and potentially EPS growth over the medium term with minimal uncertainty.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Northrop Grumman Stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys, four Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $500.17, the\xa0average Northrop Grumman stock price target suggests 6.1% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell NOC stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Kristine Liwag\xa0from Morgan Stanley, with an average return of 16.1% per rating and an 80% success rate.', 'Northrop Grumman’s strategic position in the aerospace and defense industry, coupled with the increasing demand for its mission-critical components, has formed a compelling investment case. The current geopolitical landscape, marked by rising conflicts and defense budgets, plays to Northrop’s strengths, evident in its record-breaking backlog. Hence, as its recently raised guidance suggests, NOC appears well-positioned for continued success, sustaining my bullish view of the stock.', 'Disclosure']"

This difference resulted in dividends paid by S&P 500 companies increasing in purchasing power by more than 130%.', 'Dividends have been quite important for investors, especially when overall market returns have been low for a while.

If a retailer didn't offer up even a hint on November sales to date, it's a red flag in my humble view."", ""Case in point: Best Buy's earnings call was terrible; you left with zero sense of the inflection point in a business seeing quarters upon quarters of sales declines.

More deep-discount selling days are good for volume but can wreck margins.

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund investor and the latest stock market news, then take a look at Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Long-Term Stock Picks: Top 5 Stocks. "", ""Leon Cooperman is one of the most seasoned hands on Wall Street. Mr. Cooperman graduated from the Columbia Business School in 1967. Immediately after graduating, he would work for the famed Goldman Sachs investment bank and spend 22 years there and go on to head Goldman's lucrative Asset Management business division."", ""Leon Cooperman set up his hedge fund Omega Advisors in 1991. He would spend the next 17 years of his life managing capital for outside investors and then retire and convert the fund into a family office. Mr. Cooperman's time in the industry has yielded handsome dividends, making him one of the richest people in the world with a net worth that is currently estimated to sit at $2.8 billion according to Forbes Magazine."", ""Shifting gears to focus on his fund, Omega Advisors had a portfolio worth $1.9 billion as of Q3 2023 end. This marked a small $67 million increase over the past quarter, and on an annual basis, the portfolio has grown by roughly $500 million. His investment approach is quite a popular one on Wall Street and has been followed by seasoned financial bosses such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. If you haven't guessed it by now, Leon Cooperman is another hedge fund billionaire who has relied on a time tested approach of value investing. Value investing, for those out of the loop, involves picking out the right stocks and then patiently waiting for their value to appreciate over a long time period. The key to successful value investing is to determine the fair value of a stock, often based on its ability to generate future cash flows that will be available to investors. Then, a margin of safety is determined, which measures the current share price against the fair value price to measure the potential of losses in case the bet goes haywire. Like Buffett and Klarman, Mr. Cooperman's hedge fund has also outperformed the S&P 500 through careful stock selection by delivering 12.5% in annual returns between 1991 and 2018."", ""On the personal front, Mr. Cooperman actually planned to become a dentist before switching careers. He also had 16 job offers laid out for him in 1966 - something that most fresh graduates would be envious of these days. Additionally, Cooperman actually turned down Goldman Sachs the first time around despite being offered a job. He would later go on and accept a position after the possibilities of compensation growth became clear. Value investing also sits at the heart of his strategies, with the investment guru unable to see the point of paying high multiples for firms, especially during today's fast paced product cycles."", ""Safe to say, Leon Cooperman has had a remarkable and memorable time on the stock market through a career that has allowed him to beat markets when most people were making losses. Naturally, it pays to listen to him, and when it comes to the future, Mr. Cooperman shared his thoughts during CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit in October 2023 when he outlined:"", 'Yeah, I’m not making a seven year forecast. I’m not making a 10 year forecast. But what I’m saying is, you know, I don’t think the markets got much upside in the near term. Things change. You know, we have a lot to worry about. What happened in Middle East is a concern. It’s despicable what the Hamas did. And it’s hard not to imagine a strong response by Israel and that can become broader in nature. So you know, you gotta be very careful. You know, it’s not an easy call. And I think people on your program are not spending enough time talking about our fiscal situation. They’re all focused on inflation. But I think inflation is just one part of the issue. I think that focusing on our fiscal deficit would make a lot of sense. And I don’t know how we cure it. I really don’t. The numbers are so large. I’ve advocated for several years on your program, that as a nation, we have to coalesce around the question, what should the maximum tax rate be on wealthy people? Because that will define the revenue yield to the government and the government has to size themselves to that revenue yield.', ""So, as Mr. Cooperman remains cautionary about the market's upside, it pays to see which stocks he's refusing to sell. We took a look today, and some notable names are The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)."", 'Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Leon Cooperman's long term stock picks, we sifted through Omega Advisors' Q3 2023 SEC filings and picked out the stocks in which the firm has invested for the longest time periods."", ""Omega Advisor's Q3 2023 Investment Value: $78.4 million "", 'First Purchase: 2016 ', ""Ashland Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future."", ""Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned +18.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +8% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has gained 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $2.37 per share, indicating a change of +25.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.34 points to a change of +38.5% from the prior year.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $31.87 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.5%.

The dividend yield will be 3.8% based on this payment which is still above the industry average.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Navient ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, Navient's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 12.0%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 24%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.50 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 2.5% over that duration. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Navient has been growing its earnings per share at 28% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future."", ""Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Navient might even raise payments in the future. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

In particular, the month of November has seen a resurgence, giving confidence to investors who anticipate the end of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle.The prevailing sentiment suggests a reduced fear of a 2024 recession, with expectations leaning toward the Fed making its first rate cut in the first half of 2024.

As investors look for smoother sailing in the new year, recovering apparel stocks — like LULU, SKX, and ROST — may be worth betting on as the coasts clear and consumer sentiment shifts in a way to justify those nice-to-have purchases. The Wall Street community remains quite upbeat on the following apparel plays going into 2024. Could new highs be ahead?', 'Let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to stack up three very different apparel plays that share one striking similarity: they’re Strong Buys on Wall Street.', 'Lululemon is genuinely in a class of its own. The popular yoga-wear company has experienced its fair share of rough waters over the past three years. Still, things weren’t as rocky as they were for some other apparel companies out there, some of which have shed well over half of their value from peak to trough. After a strong 33% year-to-date rally, Lululemon stock could test new highs as soon as the holidays.', 'With a remarkable brand and a leading position in athleisure, I remain bullish on the stock, just like most analysts covering the name on Wall Street.', 'Recently, Truist initiated coverage on a trio of apparel plays. Lululemon was the only one to earn a Buy rating from the firm off the bat. Truist analyst Joseph Civello made an astute observation: Lululemon is still selling goods at full prices at a time when other apparel retailers are filling up their discount racks.', 'Indeed, Lululemon has proven more resilient than the pack in recent years. As the firm expands its product portfolio while seizing the direct-to-consumer (DTC) opportunity, Mr. Civello sees plenty of upside for LULU stock, even after its hot rally.', 'I think Mr. Civello will be proven absolutely right. There are more than enough drivers in place to set the stage for a breakout at some point over the next year. At writing, his price target sits at $500.00, entailing new all-time highs and nearly 17% upside from here.', 'Lululemon stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average LULU stock price target of $447.04 implies 4.3% upside potential.', 'I wasn’t too surprised to learn that shares of footwear firm Skechers are flirting with all-time highs of $56 and change in this environment. Though sneakers are a discretionary good that tends to sell better when consumers feel good about the state of the economy and where it’s headed next, one can’t help but think the low-cost Skechers are taking some share away from pricier sneaker plays. Given this, I am bullish on SKX stock.', 'Indeed, Skechers may not be the kicks that the “cool kids” pick up, but there’s no denying the level of effort the firm has put up to gain in the “cool” factor. The long list of celeb endorsements has only helped fuel brand appeal.', 'Of course, Skechers probably won’t match the legendary success of the Michael Jordan-endorsed pair of Jordans. However, Skechers is doing its best to improve its footing (pardon the pun) with a larger number of consumers who may be more influenced by their favorite celebs. And thus far, I think Skechers has been quite successful with its marketing campaigns.', 'The company’s latest quarter saw it crush third-quarter expectations, with record sales of $2.2 billion. How much is attributable to the rough economic environment? Probably a great deal. The only thing that presents better value than a new pair of Skechers is the stock, which trades at just 16.2 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), well below the footwear & accessories industry average of 29.6 times.', 'Skechers stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with four Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average SKX stock price target of $63.40 implies 15% upside potential.', 'Ross Stores is another apparel retail play that’s closing in on new highs. The off-price chain store, whose slogan is “Dress for Less,” has thrived in this rocky consumer environment. High-value apparel and discount retail have been a sweet spot lately, and I don’t see things changing anytime soon. As such, I am bullish on Ross Stores going into 2024, as the appetite for bargain-hunting may stay robust for longer.', 'For the latest (third) quarter, Ross Stores clocked in a nice beat, with sales up a decent 7.7% year-over-year. Despite the excellent number, which also saw comparable sales rise (up 5% vs. 3.1% estimate), management remained modest, acknowledging that it’s going to be tough to stack up against such a robust quarter.', 'Indeed, Ross could have hiked guidance by a bit, but it chose to stand pat with its original fourth-quarter guide. I think that’s only prudent. However, at this pace, I certainly wouldn’t be shocked if Ross continues to blow away results going into the fourth and final quarter of the year. The appetite for bargain-hunting may not be as quick to disappear as inflation.', 'At 25.9 times trailing P/E, ROST stock trades in line with the apparel retail industry average of 25.8 times.', 'Ross Stores is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 15 Buys and three Hold ratings. The average Ross stock price target of $136.73 implies 4.4% upside potential.', 'Apparel plays are already starting to grow fashionable again through the eyes of investors. Going into 2024, the following plays could be in a spot to make even higher highs, even as consumers feel a bit better. Of the trio, analysts expect the most gains (15% upside potential) from Skechers stock.', 'Disclosure']"

(NASDAQ:ADI) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 21, 2023', 'Analog Devices, Inc. reports earnings inline with expectations. Reported EPS is $2.01 EPS, expectations were $2.01.', 'Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I’d now like to introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.', 'Michael Lucarelli: Thank you, Abigail and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI’s CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI’s Interim CFO, Jim Mollica. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it in relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On our disclosures, the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information. These statements reflect our expectations only as the call today.', 'We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our references to gross and operating margin, operating and non-op expenses, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from our prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today’s earnings release. Two comments before we go prepared remarks. We adjusted our mapping to better align revenue to customer end markets. This resulted in slight changes to our end market mix with industrial increasing at each of the other markets slightly lower.', 'These changes are reflected on our web schedule in the quarterly results section for the last 3 years. And second, one more quick reminder, the first quarter of 2024 is a 14-week quarter. And with that, I’ll turn it over to ADI’s CEO and Chair, Vincent.', 'Vincent Roche: Thank you very much, Mike and a very good morning to you all. Though the industry is obviously moving through a more challenging period of the business cycle, I am very pleased to share that we are preserving the strength of our financial performance while preparing for the market’s recovery. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.7 billion, led by double-digit year-over-year growth in our automotive sector. The combination of careful expense management and our employees’ commitment to high standards of execution enabled us to deliver operating margins of 44.7% and EPS of $2.01 for the quarter. For the fiscal year, ‘23 again set new high watermarks with revenue reaching $12.3 billion, supported by all-time highs in the industrial and automotive sectors.', 'This resulted in EPS of $10.09 up 5% from a year ago. Notably, we returned a record $4.6 billion to shareholders in 2023, exceeding our 100% free cash flow return target. Since the closing of Maxim just over 2 years ago, ADI has returned roughly $12 billion to shareholders or nearly 15% of our market cap. Over the same time, we have reduced our share count by more than 6% and increased our dividend per share by 25%. Now looking to fiscal ‘24, the near-term dynamics remain uncertain. As you will recall, last quarter, we outlined a broad-based inventory correction across all markets and geographies, reflecting the deteriorating macro conditions and our improving lead times. Consistent with our view 90 days ago, we expect the customer inventory overhang to persist through the first half of the year.', 'Challenging times like these confirm the wisdom and the strength of our business model. The diversification of our business across customers, applications and products helps to limit volatility while preserving profitability. Building upon that foundation, we took actions to better ensure we can deliver operating margins in the low 40s and solid free cash flow despite the revenue decline. Importantly, however, we are not simply battening down the hatches. Our resilient financial model enables us to continue making the strategic investments necessary to allow us to capitalize on the upside when the business inflects higher. That longer term focus and commitment is why our customers have the confidence to increasingly depend on us as a key strategic partner.', 'I have been very heartened by my conversations with customers across many markets and geographies over this past quarter. Despite the near-term challenges, they share our optimism that the intelligent edge is enabling a future replete with opportunity, and they are clear about the expanding role that they expect ADI to play in their success. Our customers’ optimism is reflected in the continued expansion of our design win pipeline, which increased by double-digits again in 2023. That growth was enhanced by sustained momentum in our Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, which is tracking ahead of our initial expectations. We expect synergy-driven revenue acceleration in 2025 putting us on a path to achieve our goal of more than $1 billion in revenue synergy by 2027.', 'The combination of our strong design win growth with recurring revenue streams from our 75,000 product SKUs, which have average life spans of a decade or more creates a business with high barriers to entry that’s both resilient and rich with growth opportunities. Now, let me share some examples of recent wins with you. In Industrial Automation, we are increasingly delivering more complete solutions. At a top digital factory automation supplier, for example, we have recently leveraged our anchor position in software configurable I/O to attach additional solutions value across power, isolation and connectivity. As a result, we captured 3x the bill of materials and secured design wins across their entire platform. In Industrial Instrumentation, we have increased our design wins at SOC and memory test market leaders.', 'Our next-generation solutions increased channel density and throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to an incredible 30% per system. These are critical parameters for testing complex, high-performance compute GPUs and high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence systems. Looking now to automotive. In electrification, momentum continues for our wireless battery management system. This novel solution enables lower weight, greater scalability and improved manufacturing productivity, driving down the total cost of ownership for our customers while increasing ADI’s content. Last quarter, we secured our fifth customer, a top 10 EV OEM. We’ll begin to deploy our wireless solution in their next-gen EVs in 2026. Now furthermore, during the year, ADI reinforced our industry-leading position in automotive, high-performance functionally save power.', 'To that end, we won next-generation power for ADAS systems at four top suppliers this past year. These wins add another growth vector to our automotive franchise, which has benefited from strong momentum across electrification and in-cabin connectivity. This proliferation of ADAS is benefiting our high-speed GMSL connectivity portfolio. GMSL has been one of our fastest growing areas and a major revenue synergy generator for us. In the last year, we were awarded 4 new wins across leading North American, Asian and European OEMs. We are also expanding our opportunity and increasing our ROI, winning multiple design wins in industrial areas – in adjacent areas such as autonomous robotic systems. Our cloud infrastructure business is beginning to benefit from the power challenges and connectivity requirements necessary in AI ML systems.', 'Notably, a large hyperscaler designed our high-performance power and protection solutions into their next-generation AI platform. And in connectivity, systems are upgrading now to 1 terabit per second and require our highest level of precision control solutions to efficiently support the growth in data generation. In consumer, we won multiple power management sockets in a portable application and a key customer. These wins truly show the combinatorial power of our acquisition strategy. We leveraged our industry leading cell and switcher, Maxim’s cost optimized process technology, and our customer relationships to secure these wins. And lastly, in healthcare, Maxim strengthened our comprehensive suite of technology for personal monitoring solutions, adding sensor AFEs, microcontrollers and ultra-low power technologies.', 'We secured a design win at a leading continuous glucose monitoring customer this year. Our solution increases the robustness, accuracy and power efficiency of their glucose center, thereby helping to extend its life from days to weeks. So in summary, we’re proud of another year of record revenue and earnings. We continue to demonstrate the power of our business model, which delivers results through all phases of the business cycle. Our continued strong investments in technology and business innovation, customer engagement, and our hybrid manufacturing model positions ADI and our customers to take maximum advantage of the opportunities at the intelligent edge when the business recovery arrives. Now I’d like to pass the call over to Jim. Over the past 35 years, Jim has taken on a number of critical financial leadership roles across ADI, enabling him to develop a breadth and depth of understanding of our business that very, very few possess.', 'So I’m pleased now to have him on my leadership team and to be joined by Jim on today’s call. Over to you, Jim.', 'Jim Mollica: Thank you for that introduction, Vince, I’m excited to be here today, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Starting with a brief recap of fiscal 2023 results. Revenue increased 2% to $12.3 billion, marking ADI’s third consecutive record year. Gross margin of 72.5% moderated from last year’s record results of 73.6%. Operating margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points, roughly half the decline of gross margin, reflecting strong operating expense control. All told, EPS increased 5% to a record $10.09. Now moving to fourth quarter results. Revenue of $2.72 billion declined 12% sequentially and 16% year-over-year, finishing above the midpoint of our outlook despite the challenging operating environment.', 'Industrial represented 50% of quarterly revenue, declining 19% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as inventory adjustments continued across our diverse customer base. For the full year, Industrial increased 6%, achieving its third straight record result with strength across instrumentation, test, energy and aerospace and defense. Automotive, which represented 27% of quarterly revenue was down slightly sequentially and up 14% year-over-year, marking 12 straight quarters of double-digit growth. For the year, Automotive also achieved its third straight record result, increasing 19%, with strong growth across our functionally safe power, battery management and in cabin connectivity solutions. Collectively, these were up more than 30%.', 'Communications, which represented 13% of quarterly revenue, declined 6% sequentially and 32% versus a record fourth quarter 2022. For the year, Communications decreased 13%, with steeper declines in wireless versus wireline. And lastly, Consumer represented 11% of quarterly revenue, down 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Consumer decreased 20% in fiscal 2023, driven by industry-wide weaker demand and ongoing inventory corrections. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 70.2%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable product mix, lower factory utilizations and lower revenue. OpEx in the quarter was $692 million, down $60 million sequentially. These significant savings were driven by disciplined expense management and lower variable compensation.', 'As a result, operating margin came in at the higher end of our outlook of 44.7%. Non-op expense finished at $65 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%. All told, EPS was $2.01, slightly above our outlook. Now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. Inventory decreased nearly $70 million sequentially, driven by finished goods. Channel inventory also declined as we actively manage sell-in to be less than sell-through. Given lower revenue, inventory days increased to 188 and channel weeks ticked up slightly, ending within our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. Now moving on to our cash flow items. Operating cash for the quarter and the year was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.', 'CapEx for the quarter was $476 million and for fiscal 2023 was $1.3 billion. These CapEx numbers are gross figures, which do not include the benefits of the investment tax credits or grants related to both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Full year free cash flow was $3.6 billion or 29% of revenue. During the year, we returned 130% of free cash flow via roughly $3 billion in share repurchases and $1.7 billion in dividends. Now moving on to the guidance for the first quarter, which will be on a 14-week basis. First quarter revenue is expected to be $2.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to be down sequentially. Industrial is expected to be down the most, followed by Consumer and Comms with Automotive faring the best.', 'Operating margin is expected to be 41.5%, plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.70 plus or minus $0.10. I will conclude my remarks with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As Vince mentioned, we continue to see broad-based weakness across markets and geographies as customers work to reduce inventory and a stressed macro backdrop. Importantly, our lead times are now back to normal levels with 95% of our products shipping within 13 weeks, given our customers high confidence and timely supply. Encouragingly, during the fourth quarter, we’ve seen cancellations fall and bookings stabilize. This gives us greater confidence that the ongoing inventory correction will taper through the first half of the fiscal year.', 'As we discussed last time, we’ve taken actions to preserve the integrity of our income statement, our balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Let me provide an update in these areas. We are once again lowering internal utilizations with a goal of significantly reducing inventory in the first half of the year. Our hybrid manufacturing model and ability to swing in external wafers will help us moderate the decline in factory starts. The unique ability positions us to deliver healthy gross margins despite the significant revenue decline from a year ago. Given the enhancements made to our hybrid manufacturing model over the last 2 years, we now plan to slow the expansion of our internal fabs and back-end facilities. As a result, we expect 2024 CapEx to be between $600 million and $800 million or down about 45% versus 2023.', 'Importantly, this CapEx reduction does not compromise our long-term growth or resiliency efforts that gives customers multiple locations to source ADI supply. And lastly, we took additional steps to structurally reduce our OpEx. These actions, combined with lower variable comp and seasonally lower spend in the first quarter will result in a slight decline in OpEx sequentially even with the extra week. So in closing, our ability to generate operating margins in the low 40s, which were our previous highs in the last cycle demonstrates the durability of this franchise and how we’ve enhanced our operating model over time. And with that, I’ll give it back to Mike for Q&A.', 'Michael Lucarelli: Thanks, Jim. Welcome to the call. It’s great to have you. Now let’s get to the Q&A session.

On November 22, 2023, Taneja sold 7,811 shares of the company, a transaction that has caught the attention of investors and market analysts alike. This article delves into the details of the sale, the insider's history, and the potential implications for Visa Inc's stock."", ""Rajat Taneja is a prominent figure in the technology and finance industries, serving as the President of Technology at Visa Inc. With a career spanning several decades, Taneja has been instrumental in driving Visa's technological advancements and maintaining its position at the forefront of the digital payments revolution. His role involves overseeing the company's technology strategies, ensuring secure and efficient payment systems, and fostering innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers and businesses worldwide."", ""Visa Inc is a multinational financial services corporation that facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, primarily through Visa-branded credit, debit, and prepaid cards. The company operates one of the most advanced processing networks VisaNet which is capable of handling more than 65,000 transaction messages a second. Visa's global reach and its commitment to innovation have made it a key player in the shift towards cashless transactions and digital finance."", ""Insider transactions are closely monitored by investors as they can provide insights into a company's financial health and future prospects. In the case of Visa Inc, the insider transaction history shows a notable pattern of sells over the past year, with no insider buys recorded. Specifically, Rajat Taneja has sold a total of 185,616 shares and has not made any purchases. This could signal that insiders might perceive the stock's current valuation as relatively high or that they are reallocating their personal investment portfolios."", ""On the day of Taneja's recent sell, Visa Inc's shares were trading at $253.17, giving the company a market cap of $520.974 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 30.61, although higher than the industry median of 12.91, is lower than the company's historical median. This suggests that while the stock may be priced above the industry average, it is not necessarily overvalued when considering Visa's own historical valuation metrics."", 'The relationship between insider selling and stock price can be complex. While a sell-off by insiders might initially seem bearish, it is essential to consider the context. Insiders might sell shares for various reasons unrelated to their outlook on the company, such as personal financial planning or diversifying their investments. Therefore, while insider sells can be a piece of the puzzle, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.', ""The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern over the past year.

The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate that takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. This valuation suggests that the stock is trading close to its fair value, indicating that it may not be significantly overpriced or underpriced at the current levels."", ""The GF Value image above illustrates the stock's valuation in relation to its intrinsic value estimate. When the price is close to the GF Value, as it is in this case, the stock is considered to be fairly valued, which may provide some reassurance to investors concerned about overvaluation."", ""Rajat Taneja's recent sale of 7,811 shares of Visa Inc is a transaction that warrants attention, but it should be viewed within the broader context of the company's financials, historical performance, and market valuation. While insider sells can provide valuable information, they are just one of many factors investors should consider when evaluating a stock. With Visa Inc's strong market position and technological edge, the company remains a significant player in the financial services industry. Investors should continue to monitor insider activity, but also consider a wide range of financial and market indicators before making investment decisions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Operating income declined to $539 million from $698 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 7.2% and 8.9%.

(NASDAQ:ALLT) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 22, 2023', ""Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Allot's Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. All participants are at present in listen-only mode. Following managements formal presentation, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. You should have all received by now the company's press release. If you have not received it, please contact Allot's Investor Relations team at EK Global Investor Relations at 1-212-378-8040 or view it in the news section of the company's website at www.allot.com. I would now like to hand over the call to Mr. Kenny Green of E.K. Global Investor Relations. Mr. Green, would you like to begin."", ""Kenny Green: Welcome to Allot's third quarter 2023 conference call. I would like to welcome all of you to the conference call and I’d like to thank Allot's management for hosting this call. With us on the line today are Mr. Erez Antebi, President and CEO; and Mr. Ziv Leitman, CFO. Erez will provide an opening statement and summarize the key highlights of the quarter. We will then open the call for the question-and-answer session and both Erez and Ziv will be available to answer those questions. You can also find the financial highlights and metrics, including those we discussed on the conference call, in the earnings release issued last week. Before we start, I'd like to point out the following safe harbor statements. This conference call contains projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future performance of the company."", 'These statements are only predictions and Allot cannot guarantee that they will in fact occur. Allot does not assume any obligation to update that information. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected, including as a result of changing market trends, delays in the launch of services by customers, reduced demands and the competitive nature of the security services industry as well as other risks identified in the documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And with that, I would now like to hand the call over to Erez. Erez, please go ahead.', ""Erez Antebi: Thank you, Kenny. I'd like to welcome all of you to our conference call. Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter revenues were $22.6 million, 10% lower than the comparable quarter last year. In September 2023, our SECaaS ARR was $10.6 million, 9% higher than our SECaaS ARR in June 2023, and 52% higher than our SECaaS ARR for September 2022. 2023 continues to be very challenging for us. The transition of the business into SECaaS recurring revenue model has proved to be slower than we originally anticipated. In addition, our core DPI business is experiencing macro-related headwinds. While we don't expect these challenges to disappear in the near-term, given the challenging economic backdrop, we continue to make progress with the aspects of the business that we can control."", 'During the third quarter, our cash balance fell by $5.5 million, mostly as a result of the operating loss and decrease in account payable. Cash burn continues to be a major area of focus for us. As our cost-cutting efforts come into effect partially in the fourth quarter and in full in 2024, we expect to improve our cash flow. While our visibility remains challenged, we remain committed to reaching profitability in 2024. Our gross margin in the second quarter was 48% due to our deal mix. We continue to target 70% gross margins for 2024, consistent with our historical performance. As we announced in July, given the challenges facing our business, the Board formed an executive committee that has worked with management to identify and recommend opportunities for further improvement with focus on driving sustainable profitability and enhancing shareholder value.', 'The executive committee and management continue to work together to prepare the budget and operating plan for 2024. As we discussed in the previous call, in order to conserve cash, reach break-even profitability in 2024, and ensure that we have staying power even as SECaaS takes longer to ramp up. We implemented a cost reduction plan towards the end of the third quarter. We reduced approximately 30% from our employee headcount, from the end of the third quarter of 2022 to the end of 2023, while also implementing other cost reductions. Our third quarter numbers include a one-time lift a cost of approximately $1.5 million. As you know, Allot operates in two business lines, Allot Smart and Allot Secure. On the Allot Smart front, while we continue to see growing interest globally from governments as they look to block illegal activities such as drug trafficking, child pornography, and terrorism.', 'Our CSP and enterprise businesses remain soft. While some of the weakness is due to cutbacks in spending, we also recognize the need to continue shifting our resources and focus to developing countries and governments as developed countries and enterprises embrace the cloud. On the Allot Secure front, while spending by CSPs remains challenging, our SECaaS revenues are growing steadily. While we are not seeing the pace of growth we had expected given a slower deployment, there are quite a few positives worth highlighting. I would like to start with the North American market. Verizon business has successfully launched their network native security service which incorporates Allot NetworkSecure. The launch is going well, the number of customers is growing, and we are discussing with Verizon several expansion opportunities to different customer segments.', ""While we cannot be assured of our success in adding additional customer segments, I believe Verizon is the largest signed SECaaS opportunity for Allot. Furthermore, as other CSPs see Verizon's success, I believe some will follow suit. We are already getting enhanced interest from other operators to better understand what Verizon is doing and let how they might do the same. In APAC, we recently launched another SECaaS service in Tonga. As this is a small deal, we guaranteed the revenue for a lot regardless of penetration as per the revised direction we have previously explained. We remain excited about our SECaaS opportunities as operators continue to be interested in launching network-based security services, and we have a differentiated scalable solution for CSPs. Looking ahead, I want to summarize our expectations for 2023."", 'We expect SECaaS revenues for 2023 to be around $10.5 million to $11 million. We expect the SECaaS ARR for December 2023 to be between $12 million and $13 million, and our total ARR including support and maintenance to be between $51 million and $53 million. Regarding our total revenue, operating loss, and cash flow guidance, we are providing a wide range because of a specific large expansion deal we expect to close this year. We expect our total revenues for the full year 2023 to be between $89 million and $94 million. Non-GAAP operating loss to be between $42 million and $44 million, including the $14 million doubtful debt reserve and cash burn for the whole year to be between $31 million and $38 million. As I stated, we remain committed to reaching profitability in 2024.', ""We expect the fourth quarter revenues to be $20 million to $25 million. Our strategy remains the same. While we believe that our DPI business has limited growth potential and the lumpiness of the business makes it difficult to forecast over short time frames, we think we can maintain a stable level of revenues through new use cases and market share gains, and we are using DPI's profitability and cash flow generation to invest in our SECaaS business because our SECaaS business is where we see significant future growth opportunities. While our SECaaS revenues are being recognized later than we would have liked and later than we expected, I remain convinced of the large potential of this business and I'm confident that it will grow significantly in the coming years."", 'I have full faith in our company, our team, and our products. And I believe the actions we are taking -- the actions we are taking make our goals achievable. And now, I would like to open the call for questions-and-answers.

If a retailer didn't offer up even a hint on November sales to date, it's a red flag in my humble view."", ""Case in point: Best Buy's earnings call was terrible; you left with zero sense of the inflection point in a business seeing quarters upon quarters of sales declines.

Doing this is more important this year given what I am hearing on the promotional cadence — discounts could be deeper early on in the season, as retailers battle for early wins in a meh economy.', 'That will come at the expense of margins, pros point out.', '""Shoppers expect upwards of 30% discounts for Black Friday for them to consider it a good deal. More deep-discount selling days are good for volume but can wreck margins. The risk is not only that November sales will be lower margin, but that the growing ""black hole"" of Black Friday will cannibalize full-price sales from two important high-margin periods: Sept/Oct (new Fall collections) and December (an important selling period for those laggards who didn\'t buy gifts in November),"" Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman said in a new client note.', ""If it looks like a retailer is offering robust promotions — in terms of breadth and depth — it's not a good sign.

Lin was riding a motorcycle in November 2017 when he collided with a truck driven by a driver for a company named Global Sunrise, which had been hired by Arizona-based GlobalTranz to move freight.', 'When the 7th Circuit decision was handed down, it created a split in the federal circuit court system over whether a broker could be held liable for such an accident, or whether the F4A\xa0 blocked that finding. In both the Ye case and the “guy named James” case involving Landstar in the 11th Circuit, the F4A was invoked by the ruling appellate panels to hold brokerages not liable.', 'But on the other side of the divide is the 9th Circuit’s decision from 2020 that held C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) liable for injuries suffered by Allen Miller in an accident involving a truck booked by Robinson. The giant brokerage company had asked the Supreme Court for review of the decision, but the court denied that request in June 2022.', 'The sharply different conclusions in the Ye and Landstar cases from the 9th Circuit decision in Miller set up the type of inconsistency in the circuits that can lead to a Supreme Court review.', '“Even in what may seem like the best of circumstances, the odds of review by the U.S. Supreme Court, by definition, are always daunting — regardless of the merits,” Marc Blubaugh, head of the Benesch Law Firm’s transportation practice, said in an email to FreightWaves. “The Court receives over 7,000 requests for review every year, and the Court may only accept 100 cases for review, give or take.”', 'When the Supreme Court denied review of the Miller case in 2022, the reaction among what might be called the “trucking bar” was one of disappointment. But that was for a decision that went against a broker.', 'Now, there are two decisions in the circuit courts, as well as a recent lower court decision in Illinois regarding Coyote Logistics (NYSE: UPS), that are clearly in favor of brokers. So it isn’t clear that industry lawyers want to see the high court take up the issue after all.', 'Industry lawyers like the way the rulings have come down', '“It’s a very favorable decision, at least to our brokerage clients,” Nathaniel Saylor, a partner with the trucking-focused Scopelitis law firm, said in an interview with FreightWaves. “So we’d like the 7th Circuit’s decision to just stand.”', 'The Miller case that went against C.H. Robinson “was the only decision for a while,” Saylor said. “So absolutely, we wanted it to be reviewed. We wanted it to be overturned. Since then, we’ve had the 7th and 11th Circuits come down favorably.”', 'If the Supreme Court denies review, Saylor said, the 7th Circuit decision in the Ye case and the 11th Circuit decision in Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) would set the precedent on F4A guidance in those jurisdictions. The Miller case would set the same for the 9th Circuit, putting brokers in more jeopardy in that region. As for the other lower courts and circuits, Saylor said, they can choose which precedent to look to should the issue of broker liability under F4A come before them.', 'The F4A prohibits state action that could impact a motor carrier’s “prices, routes or service.” There also is a safety exception in F4A, which permits legal action for improper safety management even if it could be seen to impact a price, route or service. It was the safety exception that ultimately led to C.H.

In the Ye case, GlobalTranz was not found to be a motor carrier, and its F4A arguments prevailed.', '“If freight brokers cannot be held accountable for negligently hiring unsafe motor carriers, they will have reduced incentives to ensure that they are not hiring carriers that place unsafe motor vehicles on the road,” Ye’s attorneys write in their review request. “This reduction in safety will come at the expense of other drivers and their passengers, who are placed at risk of being injured or killed by motor vehicles when brokers negligently hire unsafe motor carriers to provide', 'motor vehicle transportation.”', 'And the Ye request goes after the decision on whether a broker does not fall under the safety exemption because it is not a motor carrier. “The Seventh Circuit erred in holding that personal injury claims against freight brokers based on the negligent hiring of an unsafe motor carrier are not sufficiently related to motor vehicles to fall within the safety exception,” the attorneys for consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen and the firm of Cowen Rodriguez write in their request.', 'And they cite language from the Miller decision: “The safe operation of a vehicle is necessarily connected to the vehicle’s operator, i.e., the motor carrier providing the motor vehicle transportation. The selection of a safe motor carrier therefore is logically a meaningful component of commercial motor-vehicle safety.”', 'With three decisions at the circuit level in conflict, the Supreme Court needs to weigh in, the attorneys argue. “A conflict now exists, and the time for this Court to consider the question presented thus has arrived,” the request states.', 'As far as when the request might be ruled on, the answer generally is: anytime. The court often hands down a long list of decisions on certiorari requests at the end of its term in June; that’s when it released its decision not only on Miller vs. Robinson but also the California Trucking Association case against independent contractor law AB5, which was denied review and is now back at the lower-court level. But there is no guarantee it won’t come down sooner.', '“The circuit split is a highly favorable and important factor, particularly the split between the 9th and 7th Circuits,” Blubaugh said. “That said, a circuit split is not dispositive; it does not create an automatic path to review. After all, the United States has twelve federal appellate circuits.\xa0 SCOTUS sometimes waits for more circuits to examine and evaluate a particular issue before determining that a circuit split demands resolution.”', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'STB’s Oberman rips into Union Pacific CEO Vena', 'Estes execs recap hack experience in unusual video presentation\xa0', 'C.H.

If you want to skip our introduction to Paul Tudor Jones and his hedge fund, then take a look at Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. ', ""Paul Tudor Jones is one of the most successful hedge fund bosses in the industry. According to Forbes Magazine, he was worth $8.1 billion as of November 2023, making him one of the richest people in the world. The investor started his journey in the finance industry in 1976 after graduating from the University of Virginia with a bachelor's degree in economics. Mr. Tudor's finance career would start in the commodities market, as he would work as a cotton broker. He would spend more than a decade in this field before finally taking the plunge and setting up Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980."", ""When it comes to making headlines, the first half of Mr. Tudor's investment career is more impressive. This is because he is known as a trend player, or an investor who senses the direction in which financial market winds are blowing and then adjusts his sails accordingly. Seven years after setting up Tudor Investment, Paul Tudor would sense an opportunity before the notorious Black Monday stock market crash of 1987. This crash came after years of bull runs on the stock market that created uncertainty about stocks being overvalued. Investors then started to submit sell orders to exchanges in bulk, and when all of these were executed, the market dropped. Mr. Tudor and his firm anticipated this, and according to some estimates, ended up booking a whopping $100 million in profits. This wouldn't be the hedge fund's last hurrah."", ""A couple of years later Mr. Tudor's knack of sniffing potential overvaluations would return at the precipice of Japan's lost economic decade. This era came after Japan's post war economic boom, which was aided by lax monetary policies that incentivized corporate borrowing and spending to spur economic growth. While this is a good thing for its own sake, its negative consequences came when Japanese asset valuations swelled due to easy access to capital. Sensing impending doom, Japanese authorities started to make changes, that caused the stock market to crash and allowed Mr. Tudor to profit. Back then, as the flagship Japanese Nikkei 225 index dropped by 43% in a single year, Mr. Tudor's fund would go on to post 87% in returns for the year."", ""If you're an avid student of U.S. stock market history and are reading this, then you might know where we're heading next. One of the biggest eras of overvaluation in America was during the time of the dot com bubble. Back then, the Internet was making its way to consumers for the first time, and personal computers were starting to become common. The potential of the Internet to disrupt industries caused ordinary people and seasoned hedge funds to pile into stocks, and most of the time, without the proper due diligence in a classic example of the fear of missing out. Naturally, valuations became overstretched, and when they came tumbling down, Mr. Tudor profited just like he had during Black Monday and the Japanese asset price crash."", ""Post 2001, and particularly after the 2008 Great Recession, Tudor Investment's performance wasn't as eye catching. The post 2008 era was marked by low interest rates and more hedge funds popping up. Yet, it is still one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. Insider Monkey dug through Tudor Investment's SEC filings for Q3 2023 and discovered that its investment portfolio was worth $9.9 billion. These values often include the notional value of options, so the actual dollar amount that the firm had spent on its investment decisions can be lower. Compared to the second quarter, the third quarter portfolio marked a sizeable $1.6 billion growth, and annually, the portfolio has more than doubled in value, since during September 2022 it was worth $4.6 billion."", ""Safe to say, Mr. Tudor has spent most of his time on the front lines for most of the stock market's recent history. This naturally makes it quite crucial that we see what he's up to lately. Today, we decided to see which of Paul Tudor's top stock picks have also seen notable insider buying.

While heightened prices may boost businesses' revenue, they also compel cost-cutting measures, inducing financial constraints. Concurrently, a responsible central bank must promptly address inflation to prevent it from becoming a persistent feature of the economy. This involves the necessity to increase interest rates, a double-edged sword that can present additional challenges for both businesses and consumers."", ""In mid-November, stocks experienced a surge as an inflation report sparked optimism that the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation might have reached their limits. The S&P 500 saw a 1.9% increase on November 14, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies more sensitive to economic fluctuations, rose approximately 5%. These stock gains were driven by the anticipation that the Fed might not need to further raise interest rates, following new data indicating a slowdown in consumer price inflation for October. The central bank has been incrementally increasing borrowing costs since March of the previous year to moderate economic activity and mitigate the pace of price hikes. In addition, indications from reports on jobless claims, durable goods, and consumer sentiment suggest that the economy may be showing signs of easing but could remain strong enough to avoid a recession. Furthermore, the number of new applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. decreased more than anticipated last week."", 'See also: Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk Investments', ""That being said, committed long-term investors pay little attention to the turbulent short-term fluctuations in stock markets. Instead of getting caught up in the uncertainties of rapid changes, they choose to invest in shares of reliable companies known for their consistent performance, evaluated over extended periods, often spanning years or even decades. While the idea of investing in entirely risk-free stocks may be tempting to many, the reality is that there is no stock that can guarantee 100% safety. Even the most reputable companies can face unforeseen challenges, and significant fluctuations in stock prices are not uncommon, even for the most resilient corporations. We saw this during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when several robust companies experienced steep declines in their stock values, and that same trend continued well within 2023.

Jason Armstrong, the Chief Financial Officer of Comcast Corp, sold a total of 41,663 shares of the company on November 20, 2023. This transaction has prompted a closer look into the insider's trading behavior and its potential implications for the stock's performance."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CMCSA.', ""Jason Armstrong is a key executive at Comcast Corporation, serving as the company's Chief Financial Officer. With a deep understanding of the company's financial operations and strategic direction, Armstrong plays a crucial role in shaping Comcast's financial health and growth trajectory. His insider transactions, therefore, are closely monitored for insights into the company's internal perspective on its valuation and future prospects."", ""Comcast Corporation is a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. Comcast Cable is one of the United States' largest providers of video, high-speed internet, and phone services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand, as well as to businesses. NBCUniversal operates news, entertainment, and sports cable networks, the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, television production operations, television station groups, Universal Pictures, and Universal Parks and Resorts."", ""Insider transactions, particularly those involving high-ranking executives like CFOs, can provide valuable clues about a company's internal assessment of its stock's value. In the case of Comcast Corp, the insider, Jason Armstrong, has not made any purchases over the past year but has sold 41,663 shares. This one-sided transaction pattern could suggest that the insider may perceive the stock's current price as a favorable selling point, or it could be related to personal financial planning or diversification strategies."", ""It is important to consider the context of these sales. The stock's market cap of $170,985,388,000 and a price-earnings ratio of 11.77, which is lower than the industry median of 16.05, indicate that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers. This is further supported by the stock's price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.89, suggesting that Comcast Corp is modestly undervalued based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus, which factors in historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. According to this measure, Comcast Corp's intrinsic value is estimated to be higher than its current trading price, indicating potential for upside."", ""However, the insider's decision to sell shares could be interpreted in various ways. While it might raise concerns among investors about the insider's confidence in the company's future growth, it is also essential to consider that insiders may sell shares for reasons unrelated to their outlook on the company, such as personal financial management or estate planning."", 'Moreover, the insider trend for Comcast Corp shows a lack of insider buys over the past year, with only two insider sells during the same period. This trend does not necessarily indicate a negative outlook but does suggest a cautious approach from insiders when it comes to acquiring stock in the company.', ""On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Comcast Corp were trading at $42.63. This price point, combined with the company's valuation metrics, presents a mixed signal. While the insider's sell could be seen as a bearish indicator, the stock's modest undervaluation according to the GF Value suggests that there may still be an opportunity for investors."", ""The recent insider sell by Comcast Corp's CFO Jason Armstrong has sparked interest in the company's stock valuation and future performance. While insider sells can be interpreted in various ways, it is crucial for investors to consider the broader context, including the company's valuation metrics and market position. With Comcast Corp's stock appearing modestly undervalued based on the GF Value, investors may find an opportunity despite the insider's recent sell.

Long-term stock investors have had to muddle through challenging macroeconomic headwinds in 2023. High inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures, two government shutdowns averted, and a new war that is fueling concerns about a broader conflict. ', 'Have I missed anything? Probably. 2023 has been a year many investors would like to forget. ', 'It’s times like these when you hear the tongue-in-cheek remarks about 401(k)’s becoming 201(k)’s. But seeing your retirement savings shrink is no laughing matter. ', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s where high-yield blue-chip stocks come in. These stocks are known for their defensive characteristics. They won’t outperform growth stocks when the bulls are pushing the market higher.

But you’ll be glad you own them when it’s time to play pickle ball. ', 'And the real benefit to these stocks is that they pay a dividend which increases your total return.

Biopharmaceutical stocks are consistently affected by short-term news. In the case of AbbVie, the stock is down about 14% in 2023 over concerns of a patent cliff for its flagship drug, Humira.', 'A patent cliff occurs when a drug, like Humira, is subject to competition from generic (and lower cost) brands. However, the impact of that competition is not taking as big of a bite out of Humira sales as feared. Plus, the company is getting strong performance from two new drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. ', 'The message for long-term investors is that with a company like AbbVie, it’s about the pipeline. AbbVie has a deep one that should continue to reward investors for years. ', 'The five-year total return on ABBV stock is 92.81%. That means $1,000 invested in 2018 would be worth 1,920,81. Part of that total return comes from the company’s dividend which currently yields 4.3% and has a $5.92 annual payout per share, for now. AbbVie is a Dividend King which means it’s increased its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. ', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been a tough stock for long-term investors in the last five years. The total return on JNJ stock has been just 17.7%. At a little over 3% a year, that hasn’t been keeping up with inflation.', 'There are reasons for that. The company has been trying to reach a settlement in its talc lawsuit. But even when it does, investors will wait to see the effect on the company’s bottom line.

But with the lawsuit issue mostly behind it and the company becoming more streamlined, it’s not hard to imagine the stock will perform much better in the next five years.

These are names your grandparents held in their retirement accounts. And Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is a top name to consider.

The number of people who are moving or have already moved to the Sunshine State gives you an idea of the customer base that the utility will have in coming years.', 'The total return for DUK stock in the last five years is 26.3%. And when you consider that Duke’s dividend yield is 4.63%, you know that is where investors are getting most of their growth. Still, at a time when many companies are warning of a profit recession, Duke projects 5% to 7% EPS growth through 2027 that will put a floor on DUK stock.

That’s a 930.37 increase to a $1,000 investment. And there’s reason to believe that kind of performance is sustainable. Williams has paid a quarterly dividend for more than 50 years. That dividend currently yields 5.14%. This is a stock that’s about as steady as it gets. The company has a forward P/E of just 17x earnings. ', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'Another area where you can look for defensive stocks is in consumer staples. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) may not fit the classic definition of a staples stock. But don’t tell that to shareholders. The company continues to deliver quarter after quarter. ', 'The main takeaway for investors is the company’s pricing power. As inflation has run hot, Pepsi has shown the ability to pass along at least a portion of its costs. That’s supported earnings growth which Pepsi is happy to return to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. ', 'You can flip a coin and land on Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) here. Or heck, just own both. But if you have to pick just one, PEP stock looks like a better choice in terms of total return. You’re getting high single-digit stock price growth over the last five years and a dividend with a yield of 3.03% and a payout of $5.06 per share annually. That works out to a 65% total return in the last five years. ', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a conservative play among semiconductor stocks.

Not surprisingly, so is TXN stock which is down over 8% in 2024.', 'But this is about long-term growth, and that’s where the company shines. In the past', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to high-yield blue-chip stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) come to mind.

Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 20% and the business has deployed 126% more capital into its operations. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If ResMed can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future."", 'In the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it\'s capital at high rates of returns, which you\'ll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.96 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.1%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $2.47 billion, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?', ""For Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.06%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Ulta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $5.87 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.02, delivering a surprise of +2.56%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

With the approval of KAFTRIO for children as young as 2 years, we can now treat young children with a medicine that has the potential to slow disease progression by addressing the underlying cause of the disease,"" said Professor Marcus A. Mall, M.D., Head of the Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Immunology and Critical Care Medicine at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.', 'As a result of existing reimbursement agreements in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Latvia, and Sweden, eligible patients in these countries will have access to the expanded indication for KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor shortly following regulatory approval by the European Commission. Vertex will continue to work with reimbursement authorities across the European Union to ensure access for all eligible patients. In the U.K., following MHRA approval on November 15, 2023, and as a result of the existing reimbursement agreement between Vertex and the NHS, children ages 2 years and above in the U.K. have access to this expanded indication for KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor.', 'About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 88,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the 30s, but with treatment, projected survival is improving.', 'About KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in Combination With IvacaftorIn people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by binding to different sites on the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.', 'KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor is approved in the European Union for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.', 'For complete product information, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics that can be found on www.ema.europa.eu.', 'U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)', 'INDICATIONS AND USAGE', 'TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with TRIKAFTA.

While heightened prices may boost businesses' revenue, they also compel cost-cutting measures, inducing financial constraints. Concurrently, a responsible central bank must promptly address inflation to prevent it from becoming a persistent feature of the economy. This involves the necessity to increase interest rates, a double-edged sword that can present additional challenges for both businesses and consumers."", ""In mid-November, stocks experienced a surge as an inflation report sparked optimism that the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation might have reached their limits. The S&P 500 saw a 1.9% increase on November 14, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies more sensitive to economic fluctuations, rose approximately 5%. These stock gains were driven by the anticipation that the Fed might not need to further raise interest rates, following new data indicating a slowdown in consumer price inflation for October. The central bank has been incrementally increasing borrowing costs since March of the previous year to moderate economic activity and mitigate the pace of price hikes. In addition, indications from reports on jobless claims, durable goods, and consumer sentiment suggest that the economy may be showing signs of easing but could remain strong enough to avoid a recession. Furthermore, the number of new applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. decreased more than anticipated last week."", 'See also: Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk Investments', ""That being said, committed long-term investors pay little attention to the turbulent short-term fluctuations in stock markets. Instead of getting caught up in the uncertainties of rapid changes, they choose to invest in shares of reliable companies known for their consistent performance, evaluated over extended periods, often spanning years or even decades. While the idea of investing in entirely risk-free stocks may be tempting to many, the reality is that there is no stock that can guarantee 100% safety. Even the most reputable companies can face unforeseen challenges, and significant fluctuations in stock prices are not uncommon, even for the most resilient corporations. We saw this during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when several robust companies experienced steep declines in their stock values, and that same trend continued well within 2023. However, it's worth noting that certain stocks, including household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the future of the global clean energy and sustainability industry in 2024, go directly and see 5 Most Climatically Diverse Countries in the World.', '2023 saw the global renewable energy industry facing considerable headwinds in the aftermath of skyrocketing costs, project delays driven by supply chain disruptions, uncertainty in global trade policy, rising inflation and interest rates, and numerous interconnection delays. According to a report by Deloitte, some of these challenges are likely to seep into 2024 as well, exacerbating current headwinds. However, the report also highlights that growth is expected to accelerate at unprecedented levels, powered by strong demand and the numerous clean energy incentives put forth in the Inflation Reduction Act. Although skyrocketing demand could exacerbate supply chain turbulence and interconnection bottlenecks thereby further causing prices to rise, there are certain evolving trends which are likely to aid the industry in navigating and mitigating these headwinds to set the stage for faster growth in 2024 especially in most climatically diverse countries in the world. Most prominently, the marked increase in clean energy component manufacturing has the potential to streamline supply chain entanglements over time. Furthermore, with the industry directing a greater amount of focus to increasing cybersecurity and averseness to risk, the road to more effective profitability seems to be much more pronounced. Lastly, the IRA incentivizes renewable energy providers to increase investment in pursuing greater opportunities in low-income communities expanding the market for clean energy and increasing demand. According to McKinsey, renewable energy is set to make up a large proportion of the power mix as early as 2050, expected to make up for 85% of total energy generation. Some of the largest players in the clean energy sector are NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG). To read more on the clean energy sector, check out our coverage of Top 20 Renewable Energy Companies in the World.', 'With an increasingly turbulent macroeconomic outlook even in some of the most climatically diverse countries in the world, all affected industries are struggling to adapt, with energy companies in particular facing a variety of macroeconomic and energy-specific disruptions. These tend to include a marked increase in commodity prices, rising pressure to curtail the carbon footprint, and numerous supply chain disruptions. It is a well established fact that energy companies which create and pursue innovative opportunities during times of crisis are more likely to increase profitability and keep operations afloat. However, this usually requires a cognitive shift from merely adjusting to volatility to identifying and capitalizing upon the many opportunities presented in\xa0climatically diverse countries in the world. This requires capturing larger, predominant trends and understanding additional risks. According to a recent report by McKinsey, the global transition to cleaner sources of energy presents enormous opportunities for energy companies in Europe to pivot their domestic renewable energy production.', 'However, the report also highlights that the estimated expenditure required to make this transition by 2050 is estimated to be around $5.3 trillion, particularly as it relates to upgrading and renovating power grids, installing baseload power with hydro pump storage plants, and installing smarter technology in homes and offices for heating and cooling. Companies like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) are gearing up to play defense and curate an effective risk management approach before resorting to an offensive business strategy. In this vein, these companies are creating transparency around risks by building appropriate heat maps which they can then use to break down risks and assess a prioritization mechanism. Additionally, heat maps shed light upon the entire trajectory of a specific action, highlighting how certain actions can lead to risks that were hitherto unrecognized.', 'Secondly, companies are increasing their overall reliance on quantitative modelling. Heat maps merely tend to provide an arbitrary picture of portfolio risk. Companies complement this by engaging in quantitative modelling which can showcase the entire distribution of risk and effectively curate a dynamic portrait. The quantification of risk is undoubtedly a complicated process but it is made possible via high-level outside-in analytics. The resultant models can aid in the overall understanding of executives and leaders in relation to their investment strategies. Once these quantified models are implemented, relevant scenarios can be applied to the portfolio, whilst considering their effect on company finances. Furthermore, expert predictions can go hand-in-hand with digital simulations to best imitate real-world complications that tend to arise in some of the most climatically diverse countries in the world. The likely impact of this kind of stress testing can outline the possibilities of disruption whilst purporting possible mitigation strategies. To read more on how energy companies can navigate the precarious macroeconomic challenges, check out our coverage of the 30 Countries with the Cleanest Air in the World.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, companies are struggling to find and retain competent employees, partly due to the Great Attrition. Since April 2022, more than 24 million workers in the US have been forced out their jobs, with more than forty percent globally claiming that they are likely to vacate their current position of employment by January 2024. Numerous companies across industries, particularly the renewable energy sector, find this an incredibly complex problem, especially since the clean energy segment requires a significant amount of technical expertise and experience especially in some of the more climatically diverse countries in the world. Furthermore, the pressure seems to be exacerbating as skyrocketing demand is causing a rapid growth in the clean energy industry, with McKinsey estimating the global installed capacity of solar and onshore and offshore wind projects will have tripled by 2030. Hence, as demand for cleaner energy reaches an all-time high, there is also an internal demand of qualified development and construction employees, operations workers, and maintenance employees.', 'To mitigate and fill current talent gaps in order to capitalize on the growing industry, top players like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) must invest in a strong brand image to attract the top talent. It is within the best interests of these companies to control market perception. Global players tend to underestimate the value of regional branding in their home countries, which is an essential precondition to attracting the best employees. Furthermore, companies will need to create and propagate clear career path development, especially for key employment positions. A lack of career development opportunity is a major cause of an employee outflow, with employees who can visualize a future within the company much more likely to stay and compete. The oil and gas industry has been facilitating exploration and production development in employees for decades and it is time for the renewable energy sector to follow suit. Clean energy companies also need to divert greater investments in structured training to attract and retain key blue-collar operatives within the company. Employers need to expand beyond wages and utilize relevant training programs which focus on clear, long-term career progression especially for roles which are temporary.', 'Photo by onur ozkardes on Unsplash', 'To create our list of the 20 most climatically diverse countries in the world, we used the Köppen climate classification system to identify the major climate zones across the world.

', ""Value investing is one of the more popular approaches among professional investors, and its fundamentals are also among those that are commonly understood by the general public. While most people might be unaware of using puts and calls to make a stock market return, they are likely to understand that one way to profit from the market is through share price appreciation. However, while share price appreciation is one part of value investing fundamentals, simply relying on it alone is not using value investing. This is because the two central components of this philosophy are fair value and the margin of safety. The fair value is the assumed 'true value' of a stock that an investor calculates based on several factors such as business operations and future cash flows. Then, the margin of safety compares the fair value of a stock and its market share price to see whether there is a risk of substantial losses due to share price depreciation after a purchase is made. Stocks with higher margins of safety are 'safer' as intuition would suggest. "", 'The philosophy of value investing has been in the market and academia for more than five decades now. Over the course of this time period, it has produced some of the richest people in the world, in perhaps what is the biggest testament to its strength. Some of the biggest names in the finance and hedge fund industry, such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Leon Cooperman and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, are known adherents of the value investing approach.

While heightened prices may boost businesses' revenue, they also compel cost-cutting measures, inducing financial constraints. Concurrently, a responsible central bank must promptly address inflation to prevent it from becoming a persistent feature of the economy. This involves the necessity to increase interest rates, a double-edged sword that can present additional challenges for both businesses and consumers."", ""In mid-November, stocks experienced a surge as an inflation report sparked optimism that the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation might have reached their limits. The S&P 500 saw a 1.9% increase on November 14, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies more sensitive to economic fluctuations, rose approximately 5%. These stock gains were driven by the anticipation that the Fed might not need to further raise interest rates, following new data indicating a slowdown in consumer price inflation for October. The central bank has been incrementally increasing borrowing costs since March of the previous year to moderate economic activity and mitigate the pace of price hikes. In addition, indications from reports on jobless claims, durable goods, and consumer sentiment suggest that the economy may be showing signs of easing but could remain strong enough to avoid a recession. Furthermore, the number of new applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. decreased more than anticipated last week."", 'See also: Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Low Risk Investments', ""That being said, committed long-term investors pay little attention to the turbulent short-term fluctuations in stock markets. Instead of getting caught up in the uncertainties of rapid changes, they choose to invest in shares of reliable companies known for their consistent performance, evaluated over extended periods, often spanning years or even decades. While the idea of investing in entirely risk-free stocks may be tempting to many, the reality is that there is no stock that can guarantee 100% safety. Even the most reputable companies can face unforeseen challenges, and significant fluctuations in stock prices are not uncommon, even for the most resilient corporations. We saw this during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when several robust companies experienced steep declines in their stock values, and that same trend continued well within 2023.

While heightened prices may boost businesses' revenue, they also compel cost-cutting measures, inducing financial constraints.

These stock gains were driven by the anticipation that the Fed might not need to further raise interest rates, following new data indicating a slowdown in consumer price inflation for October. The central bank has been incrementally increasing borrowing costs since March of the previous year to moderate economic activity and mitigate the pace of price hikes. In addition, indications from reports on jobless claims, durable goods, and consumer sentiment suggest that the economy may be showing signs of easing but could remain strong enough to avoid a recession.

While the idea of investing in entirely risk-free stocks may be tempting to many, the reality is that there is no stock that can guarantee 100% safety.

(AP) — Federal inspectors have twice found hundreds of defects in the locomotives and railcars Union Pacific uses at the world’s largest railyard in Nebraska, but none of those seem to explain why a shipping container filled with toxic acid exploded there this fall.', ""Investigators haven’t confirmed the cause of the Sept. 14 blast in a remote corner of the railroad's Bailey Yard in North Platte, Nebraska, about 250 miles west of Omaha. The explosion didn't spread far, but investigators appear to be delving into the questionable decision to load dozens of plastic barrels of perchloric acid inside a shipping container with a wood floor and possibly atop wooden pallets, even though that acid is known to react with wood or any other organic material."", '“I don’t know if you’ve ever read about perchloric acid, but when it comes in contact with organic material, it becomes highly volatile. So that car was doomed from the day it was loaded,” said Andy Foust, a Nebraska leader of the largest rail union that represents the workers who were switching those railcars just before the explosion.', ""The explosion highlighted not only potential problems at the sprawling railyard but also the national rail network's reliance on everyone involved in shipping hazardous materials taking proper precautions. As the Nebraska explosion made clear, there can be problems that are hard to spot before potentially disastrous accidents occur."", 'Some details about the explosion might never be known because the shipping container carrying the acid was destroyed. Federal Railroad Administration spokesman Warren Flatau said “the leaked acid reacted with the wooden floor of the intermodal container, and any other organic material within the container (i.e., pallets).”', 'The resulting explosion propelled shrapnel up to 600 feet away and prompted first responders to evacuate everyone within a mile outside the railyard. After the first container exploded, a second metal shipping container — believed to hold memory foam — fell down on top of it and caught fire, but no other cars ignited.', 'U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told a gathering of rail labor leaders in Nebraska the explosion could have been much worse and ""grabbed national headlines had the wind been blowing a little bit different or had things gone just a little bit different in the yard that day” — much like Norfolk Southern’s fiery derailment in eastern Ohio did.', 'That February derailment — and others that followed — put the focus on railroad safety and prompted Congress and regulators to propose reforms, which have largely stalled.', 'Foust said Union Pacific never evacuated the railyard. Nearby workers left the area on their own, but most in the railyard continued working. Foust expects that to change because he said UP is revising its emergency response plan.', '“There was a large part of that yard that had no idea what was going on, and they were told to continue doing their job,” said Foust, who has discussed the explosion with FRA inspectors, the railroad and first responders because of his role with the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division union.', 'Railroad officials said at the time that the wind blew smoke away from the facility, and because the railyard is up to eight miles (13 kilometers) wide, most UP workers were a safe distance away.', ""Despite the explosion, the method of loading 56 barrels of acid doesn't appear to violate any regulations, so such shipping methods could still be occurring. A Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration spokesman said that “as the regulations prohibit any leakage from a package, the regulations do not specify what materials the drums are loaded onto.”"", 'Shippers are required to take precautions when loading hazardous materials, including ensuring that plastic drums can’t tip over. The drums used to ship hazardous materials also must undergo extensive testing.', 'In this case, the FRA spokesman said investigators couldn’t determine what loading precautions were taken because the container was destroyed.', 'The perchloric acid, used in explosives and some industrial processes, was produced at a company in Ohio that hasn’t been publicly identified. Norfolk Southern transported the acid, then handed it off to Union Pacific. Both railroads declined to comment on the explosion, citing the ongoing investigation.', ""Given the timing of the explosion, the leak likely happened inside UP's railyard."", 'Railroads inspect railcars before they pick them up for mechanical problems or signs of tampering, but they assume shippers have properly packed them.', '“We really rely on them to know best how to package and do it in a safe way, so it isn’t going to become an issue for us,” said North Platte Fire Chief Dennis Thompson, who led the response to the explosion.', 'Thompson said the emergency response went smoothly because the weather conditions and location were favorable, and the railroad let him know within 25 minutes exactly what they were dealing with.', 'Before the explosion, inspections at the railyard in July and August prompted the head of the FRA to write a letter to UP’s CEO highlighting that the rate of defects was twice the national average. In September, the week after the explosion, inspectors returned to follow up and turned up more than 500 additional problems.', ""Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena said he understands and welcomes the agency's scrutiny."", 'Vena said Union Pacific and other major railroads have become safer over time. But there were still more than 1,000 derailments last year, and as the East Palestine derailment demonstrated, just one train crash can be disastrous if hazardous materials are involved.', '“Do we have more to do? Absolutely,” said Vena, who became CEO in August. “And that’s what I’m challenging the team with here at Union Pacific is we have to get better ... We’ll invest in it. We’ll spend money on technology. We’ll spend money on people.”', 'FRA regulators who oversee the inspectors aren’t overly concerned, with the head of the agency’s Office of Railroad Infrastructure and Mechanical saying violations are common when he sends a team out.', ""“We did not find any systematic issues that would indicate they are operating unsafe equipment that put the public at risk,” the FRA's Charlie King said.""]"
