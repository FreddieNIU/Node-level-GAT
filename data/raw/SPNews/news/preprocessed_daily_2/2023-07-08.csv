0,84ee3ac8-6ec2-3897-8d5d-fb71f2868f12,SCHW,2023-07-08,Brokers Suggest Investing in The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-charles-schwab-133006144.html,1688736606,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW).The Charles Schwab Corporation currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 20% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SCHWBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SCHWCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for The Charles Schwab Corporation here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying The Charles Schwab Corporation, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is SCHW a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 3.1% over the past month to $3.24.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for The Charles Schwab Corporation. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for The Charles Schwab Corporation with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

1,b23a9cf8-6ef5-3a27-a99d-6c611edf0365,TXN,2023-07-08,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-texas-instruments-140034218.html,1688738434,STORY,['TXN'],"[Key InsightsTexas Instruments' estimated fair value is US$184 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$175 suggests Texas Instruments is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$181 analyst price target for TXN is 1.3% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.82bUS$5.45bUS$6.95bUS$10.6bUS$12.7bUS$14.5bUS$16.0bUS$17.3bUS$18.4bUS$19.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 19.60%Est @ 14.36%Est @ 10.68%Est @ 8.11%Est @ 6.31%Est @ 5.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.9% US$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$5.2kUS$7.2kUS$7.9kUS$8.2kUS$8.3kUS$8.1kUS$7.8kUS$7.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$69bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.9%– 2.1%) = US$252bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$252b÷ ( 1 + 9.9%)10= US$98bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$167b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$175, the company appears about fair value at a 4.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.320. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Texas InstrumentsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Texas Instruments, we've put together three pertinent aspects you should look at:Risks: For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Texas Instruments (1 is potentially serious)  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does TXN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

With a year-to-date (YTD) rise of 30.7%, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has outperformed The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 index’s increase of 2.3% and 14.9%, respectively.Technology stocks have more than 50% of weightage in the Nasdaq Composite index. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the most important component of the broad market index, has returned 38.2% YTD.However, with persistent inflationary pressure and softening demand, the fears of recession have not subsided yet. Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.This may negatively impact the overall financial performances of tech companies. Therefore, we believe that investing in high-quality dividend-paying tech stocks like — Broadcom AVGO, Avnet AVT, Texas Instruments TXN and Corning GLW — amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might fetch handsome returns.A stock with a history of increasing dividends is considered healthy and offers a capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of stock market movements. Dividend growth stocks generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and offer downside protection, with a consistent increase in payouts.How to Identify Stocks?We ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify stocks that have a dividend yield of more than 2%, with five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%.

3,9e7c297b-703e-300e-b83f-1b781c494a01,WDC,2023-07-08,"With 87% ownership, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/87-ownership-western-digital-corporation-134637982.html,1688737597,STORY,"['WDC', 'TROW']","[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Western Digital's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions51% of the business is held by the top 13 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Western Digital. See our latest analysis for Western Digital ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Western Digital?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Western Digital already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Western Digital's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Western Digital is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. With 8.8% and 7.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 13 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Western DigitalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Western Digital Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$49m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Western Digital that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

5,3aff88aa-5787-3c2d-8a65-e33e196a85ee,STT,2023-07-08,State Street Corporation (STT) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corporation-stt-earnings-140008452.html,1688738408,STORY,['STT'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when State Street Corporation (STT) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.13 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.68% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $1.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of -6.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.State Street Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:14% = US$6.0b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 14% ROETo start with, Thermo Fisher Scientific's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Thermo Fisher Scientific's exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 24% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TMO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.8%, meaning that it has the remaining 94% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Thermo Fisher Scientific has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 5.0% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is predicted to rise to 23% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

WMT, The Kroger Co. KR and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao CBD.Industry: SupermarketsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2117389/3-supermarket-stocks-worth-watching-on-solid-industry-trendsThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry players have been benefiting from consistent efforts to improve store and online operations. Their initiatives to boost delivery and payment options and strengthen assortments have been tailwinds. However, high growth-oriented investments and supply-chain costs remain a threat to margins.Nonetheless, increase in store traffic and online demand and efforts to boost omnichannel operations bode well for the industry. Walmart Inc., The Kroger Co. and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao are a few industry participants that look well placed on the prevalent opportunities.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry includes supermarket retailers that offer grocery, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, electronics, stationery, automotive accessories, hardware and paint, sporting goods, fabrics and crafts, entertainment products, home furnishings and much more. Players in this industry operate through various formats such `as supermarkets, multi-department stores, retail stores, discount stores, supercenters, hypermarkets and warehouse clubs. Food retail accounts for a chunk of their business.The industry has undergone a significant transformation over the years, with e-commerce playing a strong role. Given consumers' rising preference for online shopping, industry participants have been enhancing pickup and delivery services and offering easy payment options.What's Shaping the Future of the Supermarkets IndustryRobust Omnichannel Efforts: Supermarket retailers have been focused on strengthening store and online operations to boost customers' experience. The companies' efforts on store improvisation, merchandise enhancement and replenishment of assortments along with prudent pricing strategy have been proving beneficial. Also, industry players are striving to bolster online operations.Story continuesThe increase in popularity of online shopping, particularly after the pandemic, propelled companies to constantly ram up efforts in this arena through acquisitions, partnerships and improved delivery and payment systems. Companies have resorted to several options including same-day delivery, buy online and pick-up in-store, curbside pickup as well as contactless payment to boost customer experience and sales. Companies' concerted efforts to unite store and online operations to offer customers a solid omnichannel experience certainly keep them well-placed for growth.Also, digitization has been enabling several supermarket players to gain detailed insight into their operational performance, demand cycles, supply-chain issues, and delivery status. This enables them to improve their competitiveness in the market with enhanced operational productivity, product quality and lower costs.Strong Demand to Benefit: The participants have been gaining from solid demand for essentials, driven by the pandemic-led elevated at-home consumption. Per the report published by Commerce Department on Jun 15, U.S. retail sales grew 0.3% in May after increasing 0.4% in April. Impressively, May retail sales increased 1.6% from the year-ago period's levels. The rise of retail sales for the second successive month in May, indicates a favorable demand in the industry, despite the presence of inflationary pressures.Solid demand for staple products, especially groceries, cleaning supplies and medicines, supported by higher dine-at-home and work-from-home practices have been driving the industry. These demand trends are likely to stay in the near term, as many Americans prefer to work and cook at home. This has led the industry players to continue making investments toward innovative offerings and merchandising to make the most of such trends.Pressure on Margins: The industry is dealing with margin pressure owing to inflation in raw materials and other expenses, which have been denting profitability. Also, elevated freight charges and wage expenses pose a threat to margins. Continued price investments and other promotion activities also come at the cost of margins. This apart, the need for frequent investments to innovate products and bolster online operations often hurt the bottom line.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #26, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Meanwhile, the broader sector has risen 7.3% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing consumer staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 22.12X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.55X and the sector's 23.05X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.48X and as low as 17.24X, with the median being at 20.72X.3 Supermarket Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWalmart: This supermarket giant has been benefiting from its strong omnichannel efforts and last-mile delivery capabilities.

The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. 13 employees of the acquiree will be part of MMA.The buyout seems to be in sync with MMA’s endeavor to leverage Integrity HR’s expertise for introducing a set of HR capabilities such as compensation consulting, executive succession planning and talent acquisition for its midsize clients. This, in turn, will enhance the national Employee Health &amp; Benefits offering suite of MMA.Integrity HR seems to be a prudent pick by MMA due to its reputation of providing outsourced HR and HR consulting services for nearly two decades to midsize clients forming a part of diversified industries and sectors. Non-profit organizations, private equity portfolio firms, family-owned businesses, governments and municipalities make up the customer base of Integrity HR.Thereby, as a result of the acquisition, MMA will be equipped to devise comprehensive talent strategies and reduce HR expenses, thereby enabling its clients to counter intricacies prevailing in the HR environment and ensure the seamless functioning of their organizations. An upgraded national Employee Health &amp; Benefits services suite might fetch more clients to MMA, which in turn, is expected to boost Marsh unit’s contribution to the revenues of the parent company which is Marsh &amp; McLennan. Marsh and Guy Carpenter form a part of the Risk and Insurance Services segment, which usually contributes the most to MMC’s top line. MMA had resorted to purchasing employee health and benefits service providers similar to Integrity HR in the past as well. Acquisitions of Maine-based Clark Insurance, CS Insurance Strategies based in Illinois and Texas-based Galbraith Group undertaken last year bear testament to the same.An active acquisition spree is not just restricted to the Marsh sub-unit of Marsh &amp; McLennan. The different units operating under the Risk and Insurance Services as well as Consulting segments of MMC pursue buyouts that enable them to expand product suite, enter new geographies, expand within the existing locations, foray into new businesses and specialize within current businesses. Hence, acquisitions pose MMC well for long-term growth.Story continuesAfter expending $859 million and $572 million on buyouts in 2021 and 2022, respectively, Marsh &amp; McLennan seems to sustain its record of an active acquisition history this year as well. It spent $263 million on buyouts in the first quarter of 2023. Shares of Marsh &amp; McLennan have gained 19.3% in a year, compared with the industry’s 19.2% growth.

We have our next guest here that says that there's some underappreciated category of stocks that could outperform tech. He's going with the acronym of BEACH stocks. That stands for booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Global travel and tourism is expected to grow by about 23% this year. But with recession fears weighing on the markets, how much of an upside could we see in this sector? We want to bring back in Ben Laidler.He's eToro Global market strategist. Ben, it's good to see you here. So I know you were just talking about the opportunity that you do still see in tech. But you're also seeing some reason to buy these travel names. What's the catalyst?BEN LAIDLER: The catalyst there is they still got back to what they were making sort of pre-pandemic. So if you like, that sort of reopening trade, I think, still has further to go. Secondly, you know, consumers are in pretty good shape.I mean, we've been talking over 4% wage growth, with inflation, you know, on its way to less than 4%. We're probably going to see it in the inflation numbers next week. So consumers are getting a pay rise.We're getting, you know, 200,000, 300,000, you know, more jobs every month. And the consumers are choosing to spend that money on things that they really care about, you know, like travel. And then on the travel stock side, you're seeing them be very careful at the amount and capacity they add on.They've been very disciplined, which is allowing them to sort of keep pricing. So really, you know, it's the ""Goldilocks"" scenario of, you know, more demand and high prices. And, you know, this is one of the few sectors that's managed to actually outperform tech this year.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: Ben, let's look at the C in your BEACH acronym, the cruise liners. So we have seen some pullback in terms of the targets on the cruise liners. And the cruise liners have certainly performed extremely well, whether you're talking about Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian. How long does this last?BEN LAIDLER: Yeah, so there's definitely some seasonality there. I mean, these types of stocks unsurprisingly do well at this time of the year when, you know, we're all talking about holidays, booking our holidays, going on our holidays. But again, I think, you know, just to zoom back out, that reopening recovery story I still think has, you know, further to go.You know, very few of these sectors are making as much money or are seeing as much demand as they saw back in 2019. So again, I still think demand has further to recover. And again, you're seeing this sort of double benefit because the holding pricing, you know, reasonably firm as well.And, you know, all of these sectors aren't particularly expensive either. You know, the pushback against tech is it's very expensive. A lot of these stocks, you know, earnings are still depressed, but valuations are also, you know, quite low. So I think they have room to run.SEANA SMITH: Ben, dips like we could potentially see today with futures under pressure-- we certainly have seen the market under pressure over the last couple of trading days-- should investors be using those dips as an opportunity to buy? It sounds like it. And is it just that sector in terms of the travel names? You also mentioned tech. Where else are you seeing that opportunity?BEN LAIDLER: Yes, I think the fundamentals justify, you know, buying the dips. But don't just take it from me. I think the other people that are going to be buying the dips here are all the bears. And there's a lot of them, and they're running on an awful lot of cash.And I think, you know, the reason that these sell-offs are not going to be particularly big if and when they come is not only, I think, that the fundamentals are still becoming less bad, but also, you know, these investors have been completely wrong footed this year. But carrying too much cash will be, I think, stepping up and narrowing those positions.But to answer your question, what should people be buying, you know, I don't think we're out of the woods yet. I mean, inflation, you know, is sticky. We still have an economic slowdown to come. So, you know, be invested.I still think the biggest risk is not being in the market, but be reasonably defensive. And I think, you know, these defensive growth names, so health care, you know, big tech, these big stocks, which may not sound defensive, but I actually think they are, given, you know, the demand and supply, you know, dynamic-- so I think it's these sort of long-duration sectors, things that are going to do well if inflation comes down, if interest rates come down. And the things I'd be steering clear of are these sort of value trap cyclicals, which are very exposed, I think, to the economic slowdown, so small caps, industrials, commodities.DIANE KING HALL: So are you saying that small caps would carry too much risk or too much exposure in the second half of the year?BEN LAIDLER: I think so. I mean, these sectors are very cheap. You know, we know that there's a slowdown coming. You know, they underperformed. They degraded. But I don't see a reason to buy them now ahead of an economic slowdown.I think it's a slowdown. I don't think it's a recession. But I think that's still a better environment for these sort of health care, for big tech, which, by the way, you know, dominate the stock market. You know, they don't dominate the economy. They dominate the stock market. So this is another-- you know, the stock market is not the economy. I think the stock market will probably do better than the economy in the next sort of six to nine months because it's full of these sort of defensive growth sectors, and it is not full of, you know, small caps and commodities, which are, you know, much bigger in the real economy.DIANE KING HALL: All right, we're walking the tight rope here. Ben Laidler, stay with us.]"

(NYSE:NLY) — a mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) with an eye-popping yield.The company pays quarterly dividends of 65 cents per share, giving the stock an annual yield of roughly 13%.But Cramer is not a fan.""That's a stock that I think is a trap,"" he said. ""It always looks like it has a high yield, but the fact is it's been a terrible performer for years and years. I want to stay away from it.""While Cramer has warned investors about the potential pitfalls of this high-yield stock, there are other dividend plays in the market. Here's a look at three that Wall Street finds particularly attractive.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

(NYSE:O)Realty Income is a REIT that brands itself as ""The Monthly Dividend Company,"" and it deserves that title. Through its 54-year operating history, the company has declared 636 consecutive monthly dividends.Better yet, Realty Income has increased its payout 121 times since going public in 1994.Today, the REIT pays monthly dividends of 25.5 cents per share, translating to an annual yield of 4.8%.The amount is not as high as the 13% yield offered by Annaly Capital, but keep in mind that the average dividend yield of S&amp;P 500 companies is just 1.6% at the moment.RBC Capital's Brad Heffern has a Buy rating on Realty Income and a price target of $68, implying a potential upside of 7.2%.Story continuesWhile publicly traded REITs have been popular, new companies have innovated ways for people to earn passive income in the real estate market. Here's how to invest in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE)FirstEnergy is an electric utility headquartered in Akron, Ohio. It has 10 electric distribution companies serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.Utility companies have long been a staple for dividend investors because of their reliability. Come what may, people will always need to turn their lights on at night.FirstEnergy has a quarterly dividend rate of 39 cents per share, which comes out to an annual yield of 3.9% at the current share price.In the first quarter, the company earned a net income of $292 million, or 51 cents per share. In its earnings release, FirstEnergy affirmed its long-term target of annual operating earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8%.Shares are down 7% year to date, but Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd sees a rebound on the horizon. Byrd has an Overweight rating on FirstEnergy and a price target of $44 — around 14.4% above where the stock currently sits.Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET)Energy Transfer owns one of the largest portfolios of energy assets in the U.S.With approximately 120,000 miles of pipelines and associated energy infrastructure, the partnership has a strategic network that spans 41 states and all of the major production basins in the country.In April, Energy Transfer announced a quarterly cash distribution of 30.75 cents per unit. At the current unit price, the amount translates to an annual yield of 9.26%.In the first quarter, Energy Transfer's distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partners totaled $2.01 billion, which was more than the amount needed to pay cash distributions to partners for the quarter.""On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of $640 million after distributions of $967 million and growth capital of $407 million,"" Energy Transfer Co-CEO Tom Long said during the earnings conference call.Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad has an Overweight rating on Energy Transfer and a price target of $17. Considering that the stock currently trades at $13.27, the price target implies a potential upside of 28%.There are many high-yield plays in the midstream energy space. If you prefer a diversified approach rather than picking individual stocks, you might want to check out exchange-traded funds that focus on the sector. The USCF Midstream Energy Income Fund (NYSE:UMI), for instance, seeks ""a high level of current income"" and capital appreciation and provides exposure to a range of midstream energy assets.

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Becton Dickinson and Align Technology are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that BDX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.BDX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.23, while ALGN has a forward P/E of 39.81. We also note that BDX has a PEG ratio of 2.11. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.31.Another notable valuation metric for BDX is its P/B ratio of 2.86. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ALGN has a P/B of 7.28.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, BDX holds a Value grade of B, while ALGN has a Value grade of D.BDX stands above ALGN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that BDX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the latest news, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today.  Investors are talking about the latest jobs report released on July 7. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, below Wall Street expectations. The Federal Reserve is actively watching the labor market since employment data is key when it comes to deciding the future trajectory of rate hikes.The ADP’s National Employment Report that was released in the first week of July showed that the private sector had added 497,000 jobs in June. This was more than two times the economists' predictions of 228,000 jobs and a significantly higher jump over May's figure of 267,000 new hires. Within this dataset, mid-sized businesses (those with up to 250 employees) added the most jobs, with the largest firms actually seeing a decline in employment. Industry wise, it was the leisure and hospitality industry that added the most jobs, with firms in the financial and manufacturing industries seeing a decrease in employment.However, for the stock market bulls, pay gains for both those staying in their jobs and for those switching their roles slowed down, indicating that firms are feeling the heat in a high interest rate environment. The contrast between the private sector adding more jobs and a hint of a potential slowdown in the labor market continued in the Labor Department's unemployment claims data for the week ending on July 1st. This data showed that the initial claims jumped to 248,000 - increasing by 12,000 over the previous week's data. The unemployment rate also stood unchanged at 1.2%. Data for the claims ended up beating economist estimates of 245,000 - showing that they were being conservative in estimating a slowing market.Story continuesGetting right back to work after the holiday, the Labor Department dumped another set of data on investors. This data came in the form of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. Covering the state of the labor market for May, this data showed that on the last business day of May, job openings had dropped to 9.8 million with the number of people quitting their jobs also increasing but layoffs remaining relatively the same. Crucially, though, the job openings rate also declined in May, sitting at 5.9% after its 6.2% reading in April. Cumulatively, the data hints at the fact that perhaps the labor market has peaked and is finding it difficult to battle the Fed's ten interest rate hikes so far.Amidst this backdrop, one way to play the stock market is by focusing on the technicals. These involve studying different stock trends, such as share price averages, the number of people trading the shares, and the extent of market interest in the shares. Cumulatively, these enable one to paint a bigger picture of a stock to see whether any potential negative or positive interest in it will carry into the coming months and present an opportunity for making a profit.As to what lies in the future for the stock market, particularly in the aftermath of the strong gains made during H1 2023, here's what Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist of CFRA Research has on his mind:Well I think that we're likely to see a positive second half. I mean traditionally a strong first half ends up serving as a running start to the second half. Typically we're up about 4.5% in the second half since world war two, rising about 70% of the time, but if you have the first half that's up more than 10% and this one was up, higher than 15%, then you end up with about an 8% gain on average, rising in price about 82% of the time. So, basically what it says is that those portfolio managers that were underperforming the market, put the pedal to the metal and tried to catch up.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying, with some top picks being Meta Platforms, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns.

This highlights how coding games can foster entrepreneurial skills while making programming accessible and enjoyable for young learners.But you might’ve questions like what should a beginner learn first in coding? David Joyner, Executive Director of OMSCS and Online Education at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, recommends starting as a generalist and building a strong foundation in computer science and coding. He suggests two paths: specializing deeply in a high-demand field like data science, web development, or artificial intelligence, or taking a broader approach and gaining exposure to multiple areas. According to Joyner, it is prudent to opt for the latter, as the computing field evolves rapidly, requiring ongoing learning and adaptability even within specialized domains.The economic significance of programming skills is undeniable. According to a report by Burning Glass, jobs requiring coding skills earn an average of $22,000 more than those that don't. Furthermore, the demand for coding extends beyond the traditional tech sector, with non-tech jobs increasingly seeking workers with coding abilities. Acquiring coding skills not only enhances employability but also opens doors to various fields such as marketing, data science, and cybersecurity.Story continuesLooking ahead, technology's role in shaping the future of finance is particularly exciting. Developments such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), exemplified by projects like China's Digital Yuan or proposals for a Digital Dollar, highlight the central role of technology in the financial sector. This further emphasizes the need for individuals to acquire coding skills to actively participate and contribute to these advancements.In addition to traditional coding methods, generative AI programs like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Bard, or ChatGPT are revolutionizing the way beginners approach programming. Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Bard, for instance, is an AI language model that can assist in programming tasks. It can understand code snippets and provide suggestions, context-specific information, and even generate code based on user inputs. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s recent investment in Builder.ai, a no-code/low-code platform, showcases the growing significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in shaping the future. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Builder.ai software allows individuals with limited technical expertise to develop and manage apps using AI algorithms. The integration of Builder.ai's AI assistant into Microsoft Teams demonstrates the commitment to empowering users in building business applications. This partnership, coupled with access to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Azure cloud tools, aims to empower millions of software applications globally. This shows the importance of AI and programming knowledge for the next generation.Leading technology companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are also making programming more accessible through initiatives like CodeFWD. By providing a free online education program, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) aims to increase the participation of underrepresented and female students in computer programming. Recognizing the value of diversity in driving innovation, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s efforts not only open up opportunities for aspiring programmers but also contribute to a more inclusive and diverse programming environment.Now the question is, what role does coding games play for beginners to learn programming? With the rising popularity of game-based platforms, numerous options are available for individuals seeking to learn coding and programming. These platforms leverage the power of gamification to enhance motivation and engagement among learners. Alex Balfanz's success story with his game Jailbreak on the Roblox platform demonstrates the potential of coding games in helping beginners learn and hone their programming skills. Balfanz began his coding journey at the age of 9, and Roblox served as one of his initial platforms for refining his computer programming skills. Balfanz, just a high school student at the time, co-created Jailbreak, an open-world, multiplayer cops-and-robbers game, which gained immense popularity, attracting millions of players and generating substantial profits. With the money he earned from the game, Balfanz was able to pay for his college tuition and invest in his coding skills, showcasing the financial and educational benefits of programming.So, let’s begin to explore questions like what games teach you to code, the best coding games for kids and for beginners. 15 Best Coding Games to Learn Programming for BeginnersCopyright: kentoh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe carried out extensive research for our list using prominent discussion platforms like Reddit and Quora.

Jay Woods, Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist, details his stock winners and losers including Meta, Starbucks and Generac.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, stocks wobble as investors try to shake off a slightly weaker than expected June jobs report, while the major averages head for a week of losses. So where should investors look to invest? And where should they stay clear?Here to discuss, we have Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist, Jay Woods. Jay, we're going to start on where to steer clear. Because that's kind of where the conversation has been going for the last few days. I'm looking at shares of Meta right now, up slightly today, but we saw huge gains yesterday on the back of the release of Threads. 30 million people downloading the app. What's not to like?JAY WOODS: Yeah, it's amazing. The stock's up 142% year-to-date. Threads seems to be a hit right out of the box. There are 2 billion subscribers on Instagram that can easily switch over to it. But I don't know if you got to check it out. I wasn't really impressed. I don't know if that's going to last, if it has the momentum. It is a great story.But I'd like to look at the price action in this stock. We've come pretty far, pretty fast. It was beaten down last year. It filled a major gap to the downside from quarter one 2022. And it looks like it's tiring. There are a few things I'm seeing in price action that tell me it may be time to pause and it may retreat from here.- What would be a comfortable entry point for you when it comes to Meta? I mean, you could certainly argue that, look, maybe Threads didn't blow everybody out of the water but it feels really opportunistic when you think about where Twitter has struggled, if Meta hadn't seen such a run-up going into the launch.JAY WOODS: Yeah, this could be one of those buy the rumor, sell the news kind of events. For me, I think a natural pullback is in order for a stock like Meta, given the run up we've had. It's so far above all its major moving averages. A 10% correction, which would put it down around 260, would come right back in line to a 50-day moving average. It hasn't touched it in well over eight months.Story continuesThese are levels where I could see a natural pullback, and the stock still in a majorly uptrend. And then you talk about rotation in this market. Here's the sector that's been hot. I'm watching the Tens and the Twos. If the 10 year stays above 4%, if the 2 stay above 5%-- and they're borderline right now-- and they gain momentum, they break out to yearly highs, that could draw people away from these Magnificent Seven stocks, and put stock to work in other defensive sectors.- Another stock you say to stay away from, Starbucks. Two key issues you've pointed out here, commodity prices and a potential pullback in consumer spending. What's your concern?JAY WOODS: Yeah, my concern is twofold. One, we're talking about consumer spending habits going forward, and the student debt coming back into play, September, October. And I've had conversations with my Gen X kids, people that go to Starbucks regularly. What's going to get hurt? Consumer discretionary. Where is an easy place to cut? It's Starbucks.And then if you look at another headwind. You look at the commodity price of coffee itself. It had a nice little reversal the other day, prices are starting to go back up. That could hurt margins going forward. Do they want to raise prices if coffee commodity prices go higher in this environment? I don't think so. And then, more importantly, I look at the technicals. I look at the price action and it's got me a little concerned.- Let's talk about the positives here, some of the stocks that you like. Generac, specific one that you've highlighted here. We spoke with the CEO of Generac earlier today on major temperature shifts and its ripple effect. Take a listen.AARON JAGDFELD: The last two decades, you could argue, we've really seen a lot more outages, and a lot of outages are driven by weather. I think what's changed here more recently, and as we think forward here, and as we look to the future, is the extreme temperature swings. Those types of extremities, in terms of temperature swings, are really having a major effect, frankly, on the stability of the grid. And this is really a broader discussion of the evolution of the grid as we work to decarbonize the sources.- So Generac CEO, they were saying that, look, some of the temperature, or just climate impact, is a positive for Generac. Is that the reason for you getting in on the stock? What are some of the other potential drivers--JAY WOODS: There are two reasons-- yeah, two reasons. One, spot on. I mean, the hottest day in the history of the earth in the last two days. But I look domestically, I look at the outages we've had in Texas. And that caused people to go out and buy Generac generators. They need to power their houses.And then also, it's hurricane season. I don't know if you got to go to the ocean this last week. Here on the East Coast, the temperatures are really hot for this time of year. That's not good for people concerned about storms brewing as we get later on into the season, August, September. So historically, Generac has done well in strong hurricane season and unfortunately, that's something we're looking at.And then price action, wow. This was the worst performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 last year. It has a lot to reverse. First, what did it do? It broke a long term downtrend of about a year. It stopped going lower, one. It started basing going sideways, making constructive higher lows along the way. And then what happened? In May, after its quarterly report, it gapped higher, broke out of that major downtrend, above key moving averages, and it's starting to make its way higher.It has a lot to reverse. Yes, it's been having a good year, year-to-date, but it has some resistance at the 150 level. It just flagged. Gave investors a nice entry point over the last few days. But I think this stock goes back to 150. And seeing where it's come from, I don't think 200 is too far out of the cards either.- Finally, Jay, a sector play here, specifically what you like. Industrials, what's the upside there?JAY WOODS: Oh, the upside is great. This is a sector that if you look at it on two time frames. I like, when I look at charts, to look at multiple time frames. On the daily chart, it just made 52 week highs. It broke above this level, 103, 105. This is constructive price action.And let's back out. Where is it coming from? It's been in a base where it's failed to get above 105 several times now, going back almost two years. It's above there right now, 107. It got above there, it flagged, it tested the old resistance level, which hopefully is now support.Other thing I see, MACD crossovers. I don't know if we have a chart of the MACD crossovers on a weekly basis. But in the last five years on a weekly chart, we've had 6 positive crossovers. We just had a sixth a few days ago. Every single time the index has gone up a minimum of 8%. So based on the 103 level where we saw that MACD crossover a few weeks back, it looks like it has a lot to run, it [INAUDIBLE] 112, 115 easily, plus it broke out. So it's got a lot of momentum.And they say, the longer the base the higher the space. And I believe that as we rotate out of some of the mega caps industrials and sector I like, the stocks leading the way, the GEs, the Lockheed, Martin's, and Northrop's, watch Boeing. Boeing is about to go as well. If Boeing goes, the sector goes higher.- A lot of investors looking to move out of tech. Taking note there. Jay Woods, appreciate your time today. Thanks so much for joining us.JAY WOODS: Thank you.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns.

This company, which is in the Zacks Tobacco industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.76%.For the last reported quarter, Philip Morris came out with earnings of $1.38 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 per share, representing a surprise of 3.76%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.75%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Philip Morris lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Philip Morris currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 20, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Investors barely flinched at the Fed’s June minutes, the hot ADP jobs report, and the lower-than-projected U.S. nonfarm payroll figures.The Fed minutes hardly provided any novel insights into what Jay Powell and the Fed plan on doing to fight inflation. The scorching hot ADP jobs report was largely ignored on Thursday, all things considered, because Wall Street focuses on the more reliable U.S. nonfarm payroll data.U.S. employers added 209K workers in June, which came in short of the 240K Wall Street estimate. This was the first time the jobs report came in below projections in over a year and it helped investors breathe a small sigh of relief. Of course, the labor market remains on sturdy footing despite the Fed’s best efforts to cool the economy, with the U.S. adding tons of jobs and the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.6% from 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWall Street has been forced to price in slightly higher rates for slightly longer, sending bond yields higher as well. Thankfully, Wall Street and Main Street appear to be adapting to the new higher-rate environment, and the economy is stabilizing and crucially normalizing following the Covid shocks.  Plus, all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors climbed in June, following a tech-heavy rally for most of 2023. Given this backdrop, let’s dive into two stocks that have soared in 2023 and over the last decade that investors might want to buy for both near-term and long-term upside since they offer a wonderful combination of growth and value.Jabil (JBL) Jabil provides manufacturing services to companies in telecommunications and tons of other industries. The firm’s client list includes the likes of Apple (AAPL) and other giants in critical and game-changing industries to help make everything from smartphones and home appliances to healthcare tech and beyond.Jabil serves original equipment manufacturers and product companies across multiple industries and end markets, including compute &amp; storage, appliances, automotive, healthcare, telecom, energy &amp; industrial, and more.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJabil’s diversification and expertise helped it grow steadily for years, including 12% average revenue growth between FY18 and FY22—posted 14% sales growth in its fiscal 2022. JBL topped our Q3 FY23 estimates in mid-June and provided upbeat guidance once again as it flexes its reliance and showcases how vital its offerings are during economic booms and cooldowns.JBL’s positive earnings revisions activity helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. And Zacks estimates call for JBL’s revenue to climb again in FY23 and FY24 to help boost its adjusted earnings by 11% and 10%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJBL is set to benefit from a broader onshoring/reshoring push from U.S. companies and the federal government. And five out of the six brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” alongside one “Hold.” JBL shares have soared 115% over the past 12 months and 63% YTD to nearly double the Zacks Tech sector. Jabil stock is now up 405% during the last 10 years vs. the tech sector’s 255%, and it hit fresh highs again on Friday.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite its long-term and recent outperformance, Jabil trades at a 50% discount to the Zacks Tech sector at 12.8X forward 12-month earnings. This also marks 31% value compared to its own 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its median over this stretch. JBL also pays a small dividend at the moment and its tiny payout ratio offers plenty of long-term upside for dividend expansion.HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA)HCA Healthcare is a hospital chain titan that operates across roughly 20 U.S. states and the U.K. The firm currently runs around 180 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, which includes surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers, and physician clinics. HCA Healthcare has posted impressively steady top-line expansion over the last decade given its size and standing in an area of the economy that’s rarely impacted by wider swings in spending—outside of the initial Covid shutdowns.HCA Healthcare has shaken off all of the Covid setbacks, with it much easier to hire nurses and other workers and retain them compared to early on during the pandemic. Plus, people are back to getting both vital as well as voluntary procedures that many held off on during 2020. HCA’s revenue climbed 14% in FY21 and another 3% in FY22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHCA Healthcare beat our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates and provided upbeat guidance. HCA's same facility admissions jumped 4.4% and same facility equivalent admissions popped 7.5% on the back of “strong demand” for its services. HCA’s FY23 and FY24 consensus earnings estimates have trended higher since its last release to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for HCA Healthcare’s revenue to climb over 5% both this year and next to help its adjusted EPS figures pop by 7% and 9%, respectively.HCA Healthcare shares have soared 70% in the last year to top its highly-ranked Medical – Hospital industry’s (top 14% of all Zacks industries) 55% run. HCA is up 22% in 2023 and it hit fresh highs on June 30. HCA is currently trading well above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This is all part of a 680% surge over the last 10 years to more than double its industry and blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 170%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHCA Healthcare currently trades at a 20% discount to the S&amp;P 500 and a 30% discount to the Zacks Medical sector despite blowing it away over the last five years, up 177% vs. an -18% drop. Trading at 15.6X forward 12-month earnings, HCA also offers 18% value vs. its own five-year highs.HCA Healthcare is one of the biggest hospital chains and it currently pays a dividend that yields 0.8%, with a very sustainable 14% payout ratio. Plus, it still trades 8% below its average Zacks Price target, and 16 of the 22 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” with only one “Sell” ranking.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in HCA Healthcare (HCA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to HCA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?HCA Healthcare's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at HCA Healthcare's main business drivers.Effective May 8, 2017, the company’s name was changed to HCA Healthcare, Inc.  from HCA Holdings, Inc. It is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the U.S. Headquartered in Nashville, TN, it operates hospitals and related health care entities.At the end of 2022, the company operated 182 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. It operates in two geographically organized groups – the National and American Groups.The National Group includes 96 hospitals across Alaska, California, Florida, southern Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.The American Group includes 79 hospitals across Colorado, northern Georgia, Kansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. The company also operates six hospitals in England that are included in the Corporate and Other group.The company's general, acute care hospitals with 48,030 licensed beds provide a wide range of services to cater to different medical specialties, such as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics as well as diagnostic and emergency services. As of Dec 31, 2022, HCA Healthcare’s five psychiatric hospitals with 593 licensed beds offered a full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in HCA Healthcare a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $8,211.38, or a 721.14% gain, as of July 7, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 170.34% and gold's return of 46.85% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for HCA.HCA Healthcare’s revenues remain on an uptick on the back of a surge in admissions, outpatient surgeries and other procedures. We expect the top line to grow 3.9% year over year in 2023. Multiple buyouts aided it in increasing patient volumes, enabled network expansion, added hospitals to its portfolio and boosted business scale. It has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. HCA Healthcare resorts to prudent capital deployment via buybacks and dividends. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had $3.7 billion left under its buyback authorization. Its shares have outperformed the industry in a year. A solid business outlook added to the positives. However, the company's escalating operating expenses have been weighing on the margins. A high debt level induces rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Shares have gained 7.67% over the past four weeks and there have been 2 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Barrick will continue investing in community infrastructure development and income-generating projects, ensuring sustainable growth and prosperity for the local communities.Exploration efforts have played a pivotal role in securing the mine's extended life. The Seydou North, Tongon West and Djinni satellite targets have been successfully added to the mine's portfolio, further extending its operational life.

(NYSE:GS) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goldman Sachs Group. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goldman Sachs Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Goldman Sachs Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 6.9% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$523m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Core Services &amp; Equipment, Abdellah Merad, for US$4.0m worth of shares, at about US$57.20 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$53.35. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Schlumberger Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Schlumberger insiders own about US$175m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Schlumberger Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Schlumberger insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Schlumberger.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its product development activities are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and forex woes persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 123.3% compared with 8% growth of the industry and a 12.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $3.04 billion. The company projects 10.9% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and broke even in the other two, the average surprise being 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. Last month, the company announced that Bioscientia had adopted its Revio long-read sequencing system to enhance the latter’s capabilities in genetic testing and research.The same month, PacBio announced a clinical research study with Radboud University Medical Center to explore genetic causes of rare and genetic diseases.Product Development Activities: We are optimistic about PacBio's solid potential in the RNA-sequencing market, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. On its first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, PacBio’s management stated that the demand for its new Revio system continued to be robust, with orders in the first quarter outpacing its shipments of Revio, resulting in a net increase of instrument backlog.In April, PacBio announced the availability of its new high-throughput Nanobind DNA Extraction kits, another key product from its Circulomics acquisition.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: PacBio saw a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong revenues from Instrument and Consumables in the first quarter of 2023. Solid performances in Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa regions were also recorded.DownsidesForex Instability: The majority of PacBio’s revenues, expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. Further, a portion of its operations consists of development and sales activities outside the United States, and therefore the company has foreign exchange exposures relating to non-U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate against all currencies in which PacBio operates, after considering offsetting positions, would have resulted in a significant decrease in the carrying amounts of its net assets.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market where its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.24 to $1.23.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $40.3 million, suggesting a 13.5% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global video streaming industry, you can directly go to the 5 Most Profitable TV Shows of All Time.An Analysis of Global Video Streaming Industry Global video streaming has changed the dynamics of the industry. OTT streaming platforms have more viewership than traditional TV channels. Netflix and Amazon Prime are two of the biggest examples in modern time. According to a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global video streaming market size is projected to grow from $554.33 billion in 2023 to $1.90 trillion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 19.3%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when everyone was in lockdown, streaming platforms gained massive viewership. Although streaming was growing swiftly pre-COVID, the pandemic accelerated viewership. The report shows that streaming traffic increased by 26% during 2020 around the world. Overall, the pandemic has had a positive impact on the video streaming industry. North America is expected to dominate the video streaming market share over the forecasted period, led by video streaming giants Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).Digging into Old TV ShowsSince the invention of television, TV shows have evolved over time, and so have the trends and nature of the audience. Some of the most classic TV shows were once among the most anticipated TV shows. During the late 90s, the media industry was less competitive, but with the emergence of more media companies, the competition started to soar. Going back to the 60s and 70s, there weren't many options for TV shows, compared to what we have today. A notable TV show of the time was M*A*S*H, which was produced by Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) in 1972, and made tons of money. M*A*S*H finale is among the most watched TV show episodes of all time, with over 105 million viewers tuning in at the time it was aired in 1983. M*A*S*H's sales are remarkable, considering that time period.Story continuesThe Biggest Streaming PlatformNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) initially began with the idea to produce global shows. With time, trends have changed and the streaming platform has focused on improving local content.Squid Games remains one of the most watched TV series on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Viewers worldwide have spent around 1.65 billion hours watching Squid Games’ Season 1. Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) most recent shows have been local hits and that is the reason we are seeing more non-English shows getting popular among Netflix viewers. For example, Money Heist is a Spanish show that became a global hit. Narcos is another prime example for which the company paid $2.5 million per episode of Season 1, with an accumulated deal of $25 million for the season.Rising inflation has had an impact on the global economy. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) users used to share passwords and the company has started to crack down on password sharing. Despite this, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced better than expected outcomes for Q1 2023. On April 18, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $2.88, beating the EPS estimates of $2.86. The company's revenue soared to $8.16 billion, compared to $7.87 billion a year ago. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) added 1.75 million subscribers during the first quarter of 2023. However, the company expects membership growth to drop in the upcoming quarters. During its Q1 2023 earnings call, the company made some comments on this:""While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a better outcome from both our members and our business.""In addition, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is planning to refine its pricing strategy for different regions. The earnings call comments further add:""We talked for the last few quarters about further refining our pricing strategy and monetization. And if you think back to when we did our global launch in 2016, it was pretty much across the board, a bit of a skim approach and not particularly sophisticated in terms of our pricing.So think of this as kind of that next step in our evolution of a bit of a better market fit, product market fit, pricing fit, with the aim of growing our penetration in these markets and also better medium and long-term revenue. So better for our members, better for our business.But just want to emphasize, this is not a material to our business anytime in the near-term for sure. So it’s a lot of countries, but it represents less than 5% of our revenue and so it’s something that will -- over the long-term, hopefully, will benefit us and we can point to an example of success is sort of like what we saw in India.""Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) expects to reach a content spend limit of $17 billion by 2024. It may depend on revenue generation as well. ""We expect to be back to about the $17 billion level in 2024 and the rate of growth depends on the rate of revenue growth for sure.""In comparison, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) expects its content spend on company-wide projects to remain in the low $30 billion range. The company during Q1 2023 made comments on their expected budget:""We still expect cash content spend company-wide to remain in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. The longer-term content cost reductions referenced earlier in the call are not expected to impact this year's guidance range. We also continue to invest in our parks and experiences globally and in other capital ticks across the enterprise and expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6.7 billion primarily due to decreases in CapEx on our domestic parks, reflecting, in part, some timing shifts.""Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) remains one of the biggest streaming companies in the world. Other prominent streaming giants include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Amazon Prime, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) with Disney+, and HBO with HBO Max owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). These streaming giants dominate the industry and will continue to produce the most profitable TV shows in the world.25 Most Profitable TV Shows of all timeCopyright: lculig / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo collect data for the 25 most profitable TV shows of all time, we consulted five sources including IMDb, Rolling Stone, IGN, Collider, and Movieweb. While searching for the most profitable TV shows of all time, it was not easy to determine the profitability and net revenue of TV shows from different periods. We tried to look for the TV shows with the most number of watch hours and assume their profitability based on watch hours. However, it was hard to track the watch hours of a particular show as it is difficult to compare shows across decades. So, we picked the top 5 shows from every index until we had our list of 25 most profitable TV shows. When we found repeated shows among the top 5, we picked the top sixth show and so on. Our hypothesis is, a show that appears higher on a list was more popular among consumers, and therefore, made more profit for the stakeholders involved. We ranked these TV series in ascending order of their number of appearances in the aforementioned sources. 25 Most Protifable TV Shows of All Time25.

58,4bf5fd84-7ddc-3666-af07-e86d8d3a7d00,TJX,2023-07-08,TJX Companies' (NYSE:TJX) investors will be pleased with their favorable 86% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-companies-nyse-tjx-investors-120213421.html,1688817733,STORY,['TJX'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) share price is up 74% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 49% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 43% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, TJX Companies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.5% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TJX Companies has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, TJX Companies' TSR for the last 5 years was 86%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that TJX Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 43% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the latest news, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today.  Investors are talking about the latest jobs report released on July 7. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, below Wall Street expectations. The Federal Reserve is actively watching the labor market since employment data is key when it comes to deciding the future trajectory of rate hikes.The ADP’s National Employment Report that was released in the first week of July showed that the private sector had added 497,000 jobs in June. This was more than two times the economists' predictions of 228,000 jobs and a significantly higher jump over May's figure of 267,000 new hires. Within this dataset, mid-sized businesses (those with up to 250 employees) added the most jobs, with the largest firms actually seeing a decline in employment. Industry wise, it was the leisure and hospitality industry that added the most jobs, with firms in the financial and manufacturing industries seeing a decrease in employment.However, for the stock market bulls, pay gains for both those staying in their jobs and for those switching their roles slowed down, indicating that firms are feeling the heat in a high interest rate environment. The contrast between the private sector adding more jobs and a hint of a potential slowdown in the labor market continued in the Labor Department's unemployment claims data for the week ending on July 1st. This data showed that the initial claims jumped to 248,000 - increasing by 12,000 over the previous week's data. The unemployment rate also stood unchanged at 1.2%. Data for the claims ended up beating economist estimates of 245,000 - showing that they were being conservative in estimating a slowing market.Story continuesGetting right back to work after the holiday, the Labor Department dumped another set of data on investors. This data came in the form of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. Covering the state of the labor market for May, this data showed that on the last business day of May, job openings had dropped to 9.8 million with the number of people quitting their jobs also increasing but layoffs remaining relatively the same. Crucially, though, the job openings rate also declined in May, sitting at 5.9% after its 6.2% reading in April. Cumulatively, the data hints at the fact that perhaps the labor market has peaked and is finding it difficult to battle the Fed's ten interest rate hikes so far.Amidst this backdrop, one way to play the stock market is by focusing on the technicals. These involve studying different stock trends, such as share price averages, the number of people trading the shares, and the extent of market interest in the shares. Cumulatively, these enable one to paint a bigger picture of a stock to see whether any potential negative or positive interest in it will carry into the coming months and present an opportunity for making a profit.As to what lies in the future for the stock market, particularly in the aftermath of the strong gains made during H1 2023, here's what Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist of CFRA Research has on his mind:Well I think that we're likely to see a positive second half. I mean traditionally a strong first half ends up serving as a running start to the second half. Typically we're up about 4.5% in the second half since world war two, rising about 70% of the time, but if you have the first half that's up more than 10% and this one was up, higher than 15%, then you end up with about an 8% gain on average, rising in price about 82% of the time. So, basically what it says is that those portfolio managers that were underperforming the market, put the pedal to the metal and tried to catch up.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying, with some top picks being Meta Platforms, Inc.

62,53688bdd-3cf0-3e76-951a-2adce6cb41a3,NEM,2023-07-08,Newmont (NEM) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-nem-upgraded-buy-heres-160006948.html,1688745606,STORY,['NEM'],"[Newmont Corporation (NEM) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Newmont basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Newmont, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for NewmontThis gold and copper miner is expected to earn $2.50 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 35.1%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Newmont. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Newmont to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(WPM). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Newmont Corporation has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NEM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NEM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.62, while WPM has a forward P/E of 35. We also note that NEM has a PEG ratio of 1.64. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. WPM currently has a PEG ratio of 7.Another notable valuation metric for NEM is its P/B ratio of 1.69. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WPM has a P/B of 2.75.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help NEM earn a Value grade of B, while WPM has been given a Value grade of F.NEM is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

But Levi Strauss &amp; Co (NYSE: LEVI) slashed its full year guidance as it reported a harsh drop in wholesale revenues and weakened U.S. sales which represent its largest market. When Bergh first joined the blue jeans company more than a decade ago, wholesale customers such as Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M) and Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) made up more than 40% of Levi’s total business, but these days, their contribution comes down to less than 30%. However, focusing on direct-to-consumer channels like the all-mighty Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) has resulted in a rare bright spot of Levi’s quarterly report.Fiscal Second Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended on May 28th, Levi sales dropped 9% YoY to $1.34 billion, meeting Refinitiv’s estimate of $1.34 billion. The Americas' revenue tanked 22% to $609 million as wholesale revenue plunged, coming in below StreetAccount’s estimate of $639.5 million. Europe brought in $361 million with revenue dropping 2%, but topping the estimated $344 million Street Account estimated. On a brighter note, Asia revenue expanded 18% due to the strength of the DTC channel and amounted to $262 million, beating StreetAccount’s estimate of $230.2 million.But the bottom line was a net loss of $1.6 million, or 0 cents per share, while during last year’s comparable quarter, Levi’s made a net income $49.7 million, or 12 cents a share. When adjusted, earnings came up to 4 cents per share, topping the expected 3 cents.Wholesale Has Been Hit From Several DirectionsWith the consumer slowdown hitting the retail industry and internal inventory issues at Levi that resulted in items being out of stock, U.S. wholesale revenue tanked 22%. CEO Chip Bergh noted that Levi struggled with high inventory levels, which resulted in congested distribution centers that disabled the execution of wholesale orders. Bergh assured that wholesale inventory levels and customer filling rates have already significantly improved in the undergoing quarter (Q3).Story continuesLevi wholesale partners Kohl’s and Macy’s are also struggling with many challenges, including retail theft and curbed discretionary sending. Kohl’s Chief Financial Officer told analysts during the latest earnings call that losses from retail theft are expected to continue growing this year. Considering the troubles that Macy’s is facing, it’s hard to envision a rapidly declining company in an unfavorable industry pulling off a recovery or even for Kohl’s to maintain its current dividend for much longer. Macy’s even entered the battle of sales facing off the e-commerce titan Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), whose Prime day is around the corner as it introduced Black Friday sales months before the holiday season to stay relevant and boost its competitiveness. While Macy’s will be offering discounts in the range between 20% and 75%, Amazon promises more deals than any prior Prime Day event.Following Nike Was A Smart Move And A Rare Bright SpotOn the other hand, DTC revenues rose 13% as both company-operated stores and online sales grew with e-commerce revenue rising 20%.A Dismal GuidanceAs Levi’s continues to pursue Nike with its D2C strategy, U.S. wholesale revenue will continue to fall. The tightened revenue outlook for the year guides for a growth rate between 1.5% to 2.5% compared to a prior range of 1.5% to 3%., while analysts expected a 2.6% growth rate, according to Refinitiv. Adjusted EPS range has also been lowered from the prior range of $1.30 to $o 1.40 and are now expected to be between $1.10 to $1.20 with Refinitiv’s estimate from a survey of analysts being $1.29 per share.Bergh also announced price reductions on about a half a dozen of price sensitive items, such as the 502 and 512 jeans, at its wholesale partnership stores such as Macy’s and Kohl’s. This move will dent margins over the quarter ahead, but the new price will still be higher than the pre-pandemic one. Bergh also added that these reductions will only apply to wholesale partnerships. Reductions will not take place at its owned stores nor internationally.Chief financial and growth officer Harmit Sing revealed Levi is also planning for a higher tax rate in the second half of the year, which is yet another factor that contributed to the lower outlook. Th effective tax rate during the reported quarter was 78.4%, while during last year’s comparable quarter it amounted to 36.1%.Taking A Page From Nike’s PlaybookWhile shifting away from wholesale has painful short-term consequences, this is part of a larger strategy of reshaping the business model for direct-to-consumer business that comes with stronger financials, higher gross margin, and perhaps most importantly, allows the company to take control of the consumer experience which is of essence for a jeans maker who promises quality never goes out of style. It paid off for Nike so it’s reasonable to expect that the Levi's will also reap the benefits of this strategy shift at some point.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ford Motor Company F, Nexstar Media Group, Inc. NXST, Patterson Companies, Inc. PDCO and Suzano S.A. SUZ   .Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Strong Buy Stocks with Attractive Long-Term ProspectsAhead of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report today, it still looks like a difficult year for stocks. Although there are a few bright spots, it's becoming somewhat harder to find them.The first half of the year has been great, but that's just more reason for a slide in the second. Particularly because most of the rally was carried by tech stocks, that too, a few large ones. For other sectors, it hasn't been as great, as increased caution about an impending recession weighed on corporate spending patterns and increased investor concerns.The Fed is determined to get to the 2% inflation rate on the basket of goods and services minus the highly volatile food and energy segments, and many of the officials have said that the effects of past actions may already have played out. If they have not – and that is a distinct possibility – there's a good chance that they will be raising rates anyway. Because the effect of past actions is a little tough to measure. The Fed's ""hawkish pause"" in June has fed sentiment on the street that a couple more hikes are on their way, in which case a recession may be unavoidable.The JOLTS report could be positive, but the Fed is really putting the brakes on this market rally.Therefore, this is no time to be beating around the bush. We need solid investments, stocks that will outperform others in the long run. Even better if they offer some income while we patiently hang onto them. So let's get down to it: Story continuesFord Motor CompanyBased in Dearborn, MI, Ford is a global automotive company that develops, manufactures and sells a range of vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands. It operates through various segments, including Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro; Ford Next; and Ford Credit. The company sells vehicles and service parts through dealerships, commercial fleet customers, rental car companies and governments. Ford also provides vehicle financing and leasing options to retail and commercial customers, as well as wholesale loans to dealers.Ford's earnings are currently expected to decline. However, the company is seeing significant estimate revisions, so there could be a change in this situation. The 2023 estimate for example has increased 12 cents in the last 60 days (up 7.4%). Similarly, the 2024 estimate is up 8 cents (4.9%).The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has grown its earnings over 10% in the last 5 years and is expected to grow at least 6% in the next five.Its dividend yields 3.94%.Despite the above positives, it trades at a reasonable valuation of 8.92X earnings. While at its highest level over the past year, it's a solid 79.4% discount to the industry. Since the industry's valuation is currently rich, we may also compare with a broader index such as the S&amp;P 500. In this comparison too, it's a substantial discount of 54.4%.Nexstar Media Group, Inc.Irving, TX-based Nexstar is a television broadcasting and digital media company operating in the U.S. It acquires, develops and operates television stations, broadcast television networks, as well as interactive community websites. The company offers free programming to television viewers, employing both video and display advertising platforms across various digital media channels. It also manages real estate assets.The Zacks Rank #1 company's earnings are expected to decline this year followed by a strong comeback in the next. In the last 60 days, its estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased $1.98 (17.7%) and $3.87 (14.8%), respectively.The company has grown its earnings 41.8% in the last five years and analysts expect it to grow 10% in the long term.Nexstar also pays a dividend that yields 3.23%.The company trades at a significant discount to both the industry (75.3%) and the S&amp;P 500 (60.8%), based on P/E.Patterson Companies, Inc.Headquartered in Saint Paul, MN, Patterson Companies is a distributor of dental and animal health products in the U.S., the UK and Canada. The company operates through three segments: Dental, Animal Health and Corporate.The Dental segment offers a wide range of consumable products, dental equipment and practice optimization solutions. The Animal Health segment distributes various animal health products, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines and diagnostics. The Corporate segment provides customer financing services and sells miscellaneous products. Patterson serves healthcare professionals, veterinarians, animal health professionals and retailers.Unlike the others, Patterson is expected to grow in both 2024 and 2025 (ending April), albeit at a low single-digit rate. Although not by a significant amount, analysts have also raised their estimates on this stock. For the fiscal year 2024, estimates increased 14 cents (6.0%) in the last 60 days while for the following year, they increased 16 cents (6.5%).The company has grown its earnings 13.7% in the last five years and analysts expect this #1 ranked stock to grow its earnings 9.2% in the long run.Patterson Companies' dividend yields 3.2%.It is also trading at an attractive valuation, i.e. a 32.1% discount to its industry and a 34.9% discount to the S&amp;P 500Suzano S.A.Based in Salvador, Brazil, Suzano specializes in the production and sale of eucalyptus pulp and paper products. It operates in two segments: Pulp and Paper. The company offers a wide range of paper products including printing and writing paper, paperboards, tissue paper and pulps. It is also involved in biofuel production, power generation, port terminals operation and wood-based textile fibers.While current estimates reflect double-digit earnings declines in 2023 and 2024, it's worth noting that these estimates are increasing rapidly. The 2023 estimate for example is up 55 cents (34.8%) while the 2024 estimate is up 38 cents (29.2%).It has grown a whopping 107.3% in the last five years, which explains the expected declines in the next two. However, analysts are projecting 6.9% growth in the next five years. Therefore, growth should return before long.Suzano's dividend currently yields 3.43%.The shares are trading at 4.8X P/E, a discount of 36.9% to the industry and 75.3% to the S&amp;P 500.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns.

He's using the acronym of BEACH stocks, representing the sectors of booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, all eyes have been on big tech stocks this year as the AI hype sent a few mega caps skyrocketing. We have our next guest here that says that there's some underappreciated category of stocks that could outperform tech. He's going with the acronym of BEACH stocks. That stands for booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Global travel and tourism is expected to grow by about 23% this year. But with recession fears weighing on the markets, how much of an upside could we see in this sector? We want to bring back in Ben Laidler.He's eToro Global market strategist. Ben, it's good to see you here. So I know you were just talking about the opportunity that you do still see in tech. But you're also seeing some reason to buy these travel names. What's the catalyst?BEN LAIDLER: The catalyst there is they still got back to what they were making sort of pre-pandemic. So if you like, that sort of reopening trade, I think, still has further to go. Secondly, you know, consumers are in pretty good shape.I mean, we've been talking over 4% wage growth, with inflation, you know, on its way to less than 4%. We're probably going to see it in the inflation numbers next week. So consumers are getting a pay rise.We're getting, you know, 200,000, 300,000, you know, more jobs every month. And the consumers are choosing to spend that money on things that they really care about, you know, like travel. And then on the travel stock side, you're seeing them be very careful at the amount and capacity they add on.They've been very disciplined, which is allowing them to sort of keep pricing. So really, you know, it's the ""Goldilocks"" scenario of, you know, more demand and high prices. And, you know, this is one of the few sectors that's managed to actually outperform tech this year.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: Ben, let's look at the C in your BEACH acronym, the cruise liners. So we have seen some pullback in terms of the targets on the cruise liners. And the cruise liners have certainly performed extremely well, whether you're talking about Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian. How long does this last?BEN LAIDLER: Yeah, so there's definitely some seasonality there. I mean, these types of stocks unsurprisingly do well at this time of the year when, you know, we're all talking about holidays, booking our holidays, going on our holidays. But again, I think, you know, just to zoom back out, that reopening recovery story I still think has, you know, further to go.You know, very few of these sectors are making as much money or are seeing as much demand as they saw back in 2019. So again, I still think demand has further to recover. And again, you're seeing this sort of double benefit because the holding pricing, you know, reasonably firm as well.And, you know, all of these sectors aren't particularly expensive either. You know, the pushback against tech is it's very expensive. A lot of these stocks, you know, earnings are still depressed, but valuations are also, you know, quite low. So I think they have room to run.SEANA SMITH: Ben, dips like we could potentially see today with futures under pressure-- we certainly have seen the market under pressure over the last couple of trading days-- should investors be using those dips as an opportunity to buy? It sounds like it. And is it just that sector in terms of the travel names? You also mentioned tech. Where else are you seeing that opportunity?BEN LAIDLER: Yes, I think the fundamentals justify, you know, buying the dips. But don't just take it from me. I think the other people that are going to be buying the dips here are all the bears. And there's a lot of them, and they're running on an awful lot of cash.And I think, you know, the reason that these sell-offs are not going to be particularly big if and when they come is not only, I think, that the fundamentals are still becoming less bad, but also, you know, these investors have been completely wrong footed this year. But carrying too much cash will be, I think, stepping up and narrowing those positions.But to answer your question, what should people be buying, you know, I don't think we're out of the woods yet. I mean, inflation, you know, is sticky. We still have an economic slowdown to come. So, you know, be invested.I still think the biggest risk is not being in the market, but be reasonably defensive. And I think, you know, these defensive growth names, so health care, you know, big tech, these big stocks, which may not sound defensive, but I actually think they are, given, you know, the demand and supply, you know, dynamic-- so I think it's these sort of long-duration sectors, things that are going to do well if inflation comes down, if interest rates come down. And the things I'd be steering clear of are these sort of value trap cyclicals, which are very exposed, I think, to the economic slowdown, so small caps, industrials, commodities.DIANE KING HALL: So are you saying that small caps would carry too much risk or too much exposure in the second half of the year?BEN LAIDLER: I think so. I mean, these sectors are very cheap. You know, we know that there's a slowdown coming. You know, they underperformed. They degraded. But I don't see a reason to buy them now ahead of an economic slowdown.I think it's a slowdown. I don't think it's a recession. But I think that's still a better environment for these sort of health care, for big tech, which, by the way, you know, dominate the stock market. You know, they don't dominate the economy. They dominate the stock market. So this is another-- you know, the stock market is not the economy. I think the stock market will probably do better than the economy in the next sort of six to nine months because it's full of these sort of defensive growth sectors, and it is not full of, you know, small caps and commodities, which are, you know, much bigger in the real economy.DIANE KING HALL: All right, we're walking the tight rope here. Ben Laidler, stay with us.]"

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson What Is Johnson &amp; Johnson's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at April 2023 Johnson &amp; Johnson had debt of US$52.9b, up from US$33.1b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$24.6b, its net debt is less, at about US$28.3b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Johnson &amp; Johnson's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Johnson &amp; Johnson had liabilities of US$60.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$64.7b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$24.6b as well as receivables valued at US$16.4b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$84.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesThis deficit isn't so bad because Johnson &amp; Johnson is worth a massive US$420.0b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.85. And remarkably, despite having net debt, it actually received more in interest over the last twelve months than it had to pay. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. Fortunately, Johnson &amp; Johnson grew its EBIT by 4.7% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Johnson &amp; Johnson can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Johnson &amp; Johnson recorded free cash flow worth 78% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Johnson &amp; Johnson's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Zooming out, Johnson &amp; Johnson seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Johnson &amp; Johnson .At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability.

By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the latest news, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today.  Investors are talking about the latest jobs report released on July 7. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, below Wall Street expectations. The Federal Reserve is actively watching the labor market since employment data is key when it comes to deciding the future trajectory of rate hikes.The ADP’s National Employment Report that was released in the first week of July showed that the private sector had added 497,000 jobs in June. This was more than two times the economists' predictions of 228,000 jobs and a significantly higher jump over May's figure of 267,000 new hires. Within this dataset, mid-sized businesses (those with up to 250 employees) added the most jobs, with the largest firms actually seeing a decline in employment. Industry wise, it was the leisure and hospitality industry that added the most jobs, with firms in the financial and manufacturing industries seeing a decrease in employment.However, for the stock market bulls, pay gains for both those staying in their jobs and for those switching their roles slowed down, indicating that firms are feeling the heat in a high interest rate environment. The contrast between the private sector adding more jobs and a hint of a potential slowdown in the labor market continued in the Labor Department's unemployment claims data for the week ending on July 1st. This data showed that the initial claims jumped to 248,000 - increasing by 12,000 over the previous week's data. The unemployment rate also stood unchanged at 1.2%. Data for the claims ended up beating economist estimates of 245,000 - showing that they were being conservative in estimating a slowing market.Story continuesGetting right back to work after the holiday, the Labor Department dumped another set of data on investors. This data came in the form of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. Covering the state of the labor market for May, this data showed that on the last business day of May, job openings had dropped to 9.8 million with the number of people quitting their jobs also increasing but layoffs remaining relatively the same. Crucially, though, the job openings rate also declined in May, sitting at 5.9% after its 6.2% reading in April. Cumulatively, the data hints at the fact that perhaps the labor market has peaked and is finding it difficult to battle the Fed's ten interest rate hikes so far.Amidst this backdrop, one way to play the stock market is by focusing on the technicals. These involve studying different stock trends, such as share price averages, the number of people trading the shares, and the extent of market interest in the shares. Cumulatively, these enable one to paint a bigger picture of a stock to see whether any potential negative or positive interest in it will carry into the coming months and present an opportunity for making a profit.As to what lies in the future for the stock market, particularly in the aftermath of the strong gains made during H1 2023, here's what Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist of CFRA Research has on his mind:Well I think that we're likely to see a positive second half. I mean traditionally a strong first half ends up serving as a running start to the second half. Typically we're up about 4.5% in the second half since world war two, rising about 70% of the time, but if you have the first half that's up more than 10% and this one was up, higher than 15%, then you end up with about an 8% gain on average, rising in price about 82% of the time. So, basically what it says is that those portfolio managers that were underperforming the market, put the pedal to the metal and tried to catch up.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying, with some top picks being Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NYSE:WMB)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-williams-companies-163129012.html,1688747489,STORY,['WMB'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Williams Companies fair value estimate is US$34.15With US$32.37 share price, Williams Companies appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for WMB is US$36.41, which is 6.6% above our fair value estimateToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.64bUS$3.27bUS$3.58bUS$3.86bUS$4.07bUS$4.25bUS$4.41bUS$4.56bUS$4.69bUS$4.82bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 5.47%Est @ 4.46%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.26%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$55bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$55b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$19bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$32.4, the company appears about fair value at a 5.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Williams Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.510. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Williams CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Williams Companies, we've put together three important elements you should further research:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Williams Companies  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does WMB's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

I think right now the big issue with ordering jets is when you're going to receive them,"" 777 Managing Partner Josh Wander told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, without disclosing specific numbers.The talks come amid a rush for planes by airlines eager to tap into a greater-than-expected recovery in air travel.Miami-based 777, which invests its founders' money rather than seeking funds from other investors and has about $10 billion in assets under management, had finalized orders for 60 aircraft in its portfolio.""777 is in discussions with ATR on an additional opportunity that includes aircraft, technology and airline services and if firmed up would put the committed aircraft purchase agreements into the triple digits,"" the firm said in a statement.Boeing said it had no comment and ATR was not immediately available for comment.Earlier this year, Air India placed an order for 470 jets with Boeing and Airbus SE - which was later eclipsed by rival IndiGo's order for 500 Airbus planes.Wander said the company is also looking at investments in Asia and South America and is close to striking a deal to invest in a South African carrier, whose name he did not reveal.777's business model involves buying jets and leasing them to airlines which it backs, such as Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines and Australian airline Bonza.Flair had four aircraft seized in March as a result of a commercial dispute with a New-York based hedge fund and aircraft lessor Airborne Capital Ltd; the matter is now in court.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including BHP Group Limited (BHP), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) and The Boeing Company (BA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of BHP Group have outperformed the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (+19.1% vs. +6.3%) as the company's leverage to the prospect of Chinese fiscal stimulus through its iron ore production outlook. The company’s iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2023 is 249-260 Mt, indicating 1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Iron ore prices had earlier lost steam on weak demand in China due to the slump in property investment while supply prospects remained strong.However, the possibility that the Chinese government will provide stimulus measures for its construction sector has helped lift up iron ore prices lately. Going forward, iron ore prices are expected to be supported by demand in the automotive sector, infrastructure and housing market.Copper and nickel prices will also be fueled by growing demand for electric vehicles.  BHP’s investment in growth projects with focus on commodities like copper, nickel and potash will aid growth. Its efforts to make operations more efficient through technology adoption will drive earnings.(You can read the full research report on BHP Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AstraZeneca shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-0.4% vs. +8.6%).

Cost-cutting efforts should drive earnings.

The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. Lately, the company has been witnessing a solid recovery in its commercial business.During the first quarter, the company booked 107 net commercial airplane orders. The U.S. government’s inclination toward strengthening the nation’s defense system should also boost Boeing’s growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term.However, its 737 MAX program remains a cause of concern in China, thereby impacting its expectation of delivery timing and future gradual production rate increases. Boeing continues to incur notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets, which may hurt its future results.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Diageo plc (DEO), Arthur J.

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

The treatment, a twice-monthly infusion for early-stage Alzheimer's, previously received unanimous support from an external advisory committee to the FDA.It is the second attempt for Eisai and Biogen, which suffered a disastrous rollout — and subsequent rollback— of Leqembi's predecessor, Aduhelm.And while there appears to be more optimism around Leqembi, the road ahead is riddled with speed bumps. Wall Street's reaction Friday suggested as much.Shares of both Biogen and Eisai took hits Friday, with Biogen stock down more than 2% amid a broad market rally. Shares of Eisai trading in Japan fell more than 4% on Friday.Analysts at SVB Securities, however, expressed more relative optimism around the news, writing in a note on Friday, ""We don’t believe these label updates will impact the uptake of Leqembi. ... We continue to expect a slow ramp in 2023 and acceleration moving into 2024.""Burdensome caveatsLeqembi initially received conditional approval in January, which kept Medicare users from accessing the treatment unless they were willing to pay out of pocket and stymied Eisai and Biogen's commercial prospects. Pressure began to recede once the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agreed to cover the treatment.And with CMS now also agreeing to cover the treatment, the companies could see benefits from the approval in the second half of 2023. But this approval comes with some burdensome caveats.Dr. Seth Gale points out evidence of Alzheimer’s disease on PET scans at Brigham And Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., March 30, 2023. REUTERS/Brian Snyder (Brian Snyder / reuters)Those caveats include close monitoring of patients and collection of data for adverse events. A registry has been set up to follow patients and gain greater insight into the prevalence of serious side effects.Story continuesIn clinical trials conducted by Eisai and Biogen, 17% of participants on Leqembi experienced brain bleeding, and it remains to be seen how much that and brain swelling is seen in the real world.In addition, the FDA included a testing requirement to identify those higher at risk for serious side effects and discuss these risks with patients.Several headwindsLeqembi is also the second attempt by the duo to target plaque buildup in the brain — known as amyloid beta — and faces several headwinds in addition to the requirements from the US government.In addition to the burden on clinicians and patients, the high costs could add up. Commercial payors have stayed silent on how they will plan to cover the treatment — and if prior authorization will be required. And Medicare's coverage still requires 20% coinsurance after a patient's deductible is met.A recent estimate put the burden on Medicare at between $2 billion and $5 billion annually, based on the $26,500 per year price tag for Leqembi. That could increase Medicare beneficiary premiums, according to research from JAMA.High costs could also become a political challenge for the company, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among those who have been pushing back on the price of the new Alzheimer's drugs, saying they could bankrupt Medicare.""According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, if only 10% of the 6.7 million older adults with Alzheimer’s disease take Leqembi at Eisai and Biogen’s proposed price, it would cost Medicare $17.8 billion, which is nearly half of what Medicare Part B spent on all drugs in 2021,"" Sanders said last month prior to the treatment's approval.Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) holds a press conference on Capitol Hill on March 7, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)And that's before it faces competition from Eli Lilly's (LLY) donanemab, which reported positive Phase 3 data in May and is expected to receive approval.Analysts at JPMorgan noted Friday that the uptick in costs from these new drugs may not have been factored into Medicare Advantage plan pricing.""It is possible Leqembi approval (and the potential traditional approval of Donanemab) could drive some incremental costs in 2H23 but the bigger question is likely around potential 2024 impact. MA plans have some cushion in their bids for unexpected trend increases, but it is unclear how potential Leqembi/Donanemab costs factor in vs. expectations,"" the analysts said.Among Medicare Advantage plan sponsors Humana (HUM) could see the highest impacts with Cigna (CI) likely facing more muted challenges.Another headwind for the treatment will be limited patient access. While Medicare coverage helps provide the treatment to millions more patients, the burden of a twice-weekly infusion could hamper patient uptake in the near term.The aforementioned challenges with Aduhelm are also likely to weigh on Leqembi as the duo overcome skepticism in the clinical community about the seriousness of the side effects.Still, Wall Street sees some upside.BMO Research analysts noted that while the approval was expected, ""investor attention now turns to building out the market for patient access.""JPMorgan noted that UnitedHealth (UNH) and CVS (CVS) are likely to see the most upside from the approvals, as they both operate home infusion businesses, which could offset the pressures on their Medicare Advantage costs, the analysts said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability.

By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the latest news, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today.  Investors are talking about the latest jobs report released on July 7. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, below Wall Street expectations. The Federal Reserve is actively watching the labor market since employment data is key when it comes to deciding the future trajectory of rate hikes.The ADP’s National Employment Report that was released in the first week of July showed that the private sector had added 497,000 jobs in June. This was more than two times the economists' predictions of 228,000 jobs and a significantly higher jump over May's figure of 267,000 new hires. Within this dataset, mid-sized businesses (those with up to 250 employees) added the most jobs, with the largest firms actually seeing a decline in employment. Industry wise, it was the leisure and hospitality industry that added the most jobs, with firms in the financial and manufacturing industries seeing a decrease in employment.However, for the stock market bulls, pay gains for both those staying in their jobs and for those switching their roles slowed down, indicating that firms are feeling the heat in a high interest rate environment. The contrast between the private sector adding more jobs and a hint of a potential slowdown in the labor market continued in the Labor Department's unemployment claims data for the week ending on July 1st. This data showed that the initial claims jumped to 248,000 - increasing by 12,000 over the previous week's data. The unemployment rate also stood unchanged at 1.2%. Data for the claims ended up beating economist estimates of 245,000 - showing that they were being conservative in estimating a slowing market.Story continuesGetting right back to work after the holiday, the Labor Department dumped another set of data on investors. This data came in the form of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. Covering the state of the labor market for May, this data showed that on the last business day of May, job openings had dropped to 9.8 million with the number of people quitting their jobs also increasing but layoffs remaining relatively the same. Crucially, though, the job openings rate also declined in May, sitting at 5.9% after its 6.2% reading in April. Cumulatively, the data hints at the fact that perhaps the labor market has peaked and is finding it difficult to battle the Fed's ten interest rate hikes so far.Amidst this backdrop, one way to play the stock market is by focusing on the technicals. These involve studying different stock trends, such as share price averages, the number of people trading the shares, and the extent of market interest in the shares. Cumulatively, these enable one to paint a bigger picture of a stock to see whether any potential negative or positive interest in it will carry into the coming months and present an opportunity for making a profit.As to what lies in the future for the stock market, particularly in the aftermath of the strong gains made during H1 2023, here's what Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist of CFRA Research has on his mind:Well I think that we're likely to see a positive second half. I mean traditionally a strong first half ends up serving as a running start to the second half. Typically we're up about 4.5% in the second half since world war two, rising about 70% of the time, but if you have the first half that's up more than 10% and this one was up, higher than 15%, then you end up with about an 8% gain on average, rising in price about 82% of the time. So, basically what it says is that those portfolio managers that were underperforming the market, put the pedal to the metal and tried to catch up.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying, with some top picks being Meta Platforms, Inc.

111,faf145de-88c1-32ac-9fdb-40344c9e0902,NKE,2023-07-08,"Levi Follows Nike's Footsteps But Even With Everlasting Jeans, Business Model Success Doesn't Happen Overnight",Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/levi-follows-nikes-footsteps-even-154430820.html,1688744670,STORY,"['NKE', 'LEVI', 'M', 'KSS']","[On Thursday after market close, the jeans retailer succeeded to narrowly beat Wall Street estimates. But Levi Strauss &amp; Co (NYSE: LEVI) slashed its full year guidance as it reported a harsh drop in wholesale revenues and weakened U.S. sales which represent its largest market. When Bergh first joined the blue jeans company more than a decade ago, wholesale customers such as Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M) and Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) made up more than 40% of Levi’s total business, but these days, their contribution comes down to less than 30%. However, focusing on direct-to-consumer channels like the all-mighty Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) has resulted in a rare bright spot of Levi’s quarterly report.Fiscal Second Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended on May 28th, Levi sales dropped 9% YoY to $1.34 billion, meeting Refinitiv’s estimate of $1.34 billion. The Americas' revenue tanked 22% to $609 million as wholesale revenue plunged, coming in below StreetAccount’s estimate of $639.5 million. Europe brought in $361 million with revenue dropping 2%, but topping the estimated $344 million Street Account estimated. On a brighter note, Asia revenue expanded 18% due to the strength of the DTC channel and amounted to $262 million, beating StreetAccount’s estimate of $230.2 million.But the bottom line was a net loss of $1.6 million, or 0 cents per share, while during last year’s comparable quarter, Levi’s made a net income $49.7 million, or 12 cents a share. When adjusted, earnings came up to 4 cents per share, topping the expected 3 cents.Wholesale Has Been Hit From Several DirectionsWith the consumer slowdown hitting the retail industry and internal inventory issues at Levi that resulted in items being out of stock, U.S. wholesale revenue tanked 22%. CEO Chip Bergh noted that Levi struggled with high inventory levels, which resulted in congested distribution centers that disabled the execution of wholesale orders. Bergh assured that wholesale inventory levels and customer filling rates have already significantly improved in the undergoing quarter (Q3).Story continuesLevi wholesale partners Kohl’s and Macy’s are also struggling with many challenges, including retail theft and curbed discretionary sending. Kohl’s Chief Financial Officer told analysts during the latest earnings call that losses from retail theft are expected to continue growing this year. Considering the troubles that Macy’s is facing, it’s hard to envision a rapidly declining company in an unfavorable industry pulling off a recovery or even for Kohl’s to maintain its current dividend for much longer. Macy’s even entered the battle of sales facing off the e-commerce titan Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), whose Prime day is around the corner as it introduced Black Friday sales months before the holiday season to stay relevant and boost its competitiveness. While Macy’s will be offering discounts in the range between 20% and 75%, Amazon promises more deals than any prior Prime Day event.Following Nike Was A Smart Move And A Rare Bright SpotOn the other hand, DTC revenues rose 13% as both company-operated stores and online sales grew with e-commerce revenue rising 20%.A Dismal GuidanceAs Levi’s continues to pursue Nike with its D2C strategy, U.S. wholesale revenue will continue to fall. The tightened revenue outlook for the year guides for a growth rate between 1.5% to 2.5% compared to a prior range of 1.5% to 3%., while analysts expected a 2.6% growth rate, according to Refinitiv. Adjusted EPS range has also been lowered from the prior range of $1.30 to $o 1.40 and are now expected to be between $1.10 to $1.20 with Refinitiv’s estimate from a survey of analysts being $1.29 per share.Bergh also announced price reductions on about a half a dozen of price sensitive items, such as the 502 and 512 jeans, at its wholesale partnership stores such as Macy’s and Kohl’s. This move will dent margins over the quarter ahead, but the new price will still be higher than the pre-pandemic one. Bergh also added that these reductions will only apply to wholesale partnerships. Reductions will not take place at its owned stores nor internationally.Chief financial and growth officer Harmit Sing revealed Levi is also planning for a higher tax rate in the second half of the year, which is yet another factor that contributed to the lower outlook. Th effective tax rate during the reported quarter was 78.4%, while during last year’s comparable quarter it amounted to 36.1%.Taking A Page From Nike’s PlaybookWhile shifting away from wholesale has painful short-term consequences, this is part of a larger strategy of reshaping the business model for direct-to-consumer business that comes with stronger financials, higher gross margin, and perhaps most importantly, allows the company to take control of the consumer experience which is of essence for a jeans maker who promises quality never goes out of style. It paid off for Nike so it’s reasonable to expect that the Levi's will also reap the benefits of this strategy shift at some point.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges.

117,f5170b43-fcbd-3582-ade2-3ab335b5dd3e,WFC,2023-07-08,Wells Fargo (WFC) Q2 Earnings Coming Up: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-earnings-153900649.html,1688744340,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 14, before the opening bell. The company’s quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to have improved year over year.In the last reported quarter, WFC’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher net interest income (NII) and solid average loan growth. The fall in non-interest expenses acted as another tailwind. However, dismal non-interest income, higher provisions and weakness in the mortgage business were the major undermining factors.Over the trailing four quarters, Wells Fargo’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 7.17%.Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and EPS SurpriseWells Fargo &amp; Company price-eps-surprise | Wells Fargo &amp; Company Quote Let’s take a look at factors that are expected to have influenced Wells Fargo’s second-quarter earnings.Loans and NII: Banks’ lending activities are likely to have declined in the second quarter, as the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates impacted consumer spending. Per Fed’s latest data, demand for commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans and consumer loans decreased in April and May from first-quarter end.Nonetheless, in May 2023, Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 5-5.25%, the highest since 2008. Further, in June it declared no changes in the given policy rate. Driven by interest rate hikes, Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed an improvement in earning asset yields, margin and NII in the quarter to be reported. Also, lower mortgage-backed securities premium amortization is expected to have aided NII.Amid these considerations, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC’s NII is pegged at $12.94 billion, indicating a 26.9% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Mortgage Banking Revenues: In first-quarter 2023, Wells Fargo communicated its strategic plans to exit Correspondent business with an intention to reduce risks in mortgage business. Further, in the second quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.81% in June, up from 4.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing compared with the prior-year quarter.Story continuesHence, being one of the largest bank mortgage lenders in the United States, WFC is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking income in second-quarter 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC’s second-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $250 million, implying a 12.9% fall on a year-over-year basis.Overall Non-Interest Revenues: Wells Fargo’s investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have borne the brunt of weaker equity and fixed-income market performance. A dip in market valuations and lower transactional activities are expected to have been headwinds too.Further, the company is likely to have seen lower deposit-related fees due to an expected decline in deposits given the impact of regional bank collapses. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $1.15 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 16.2%.Global deal making is likely to have continued shrinking in the second quarter from the prior year, with deal volume and total deal value numbers crashing. Geopolitical tensions, inflation, high interest rates and fears of a global recession are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals.Similarly, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances are expected to have dried up in the to-be-reported quarter. Bond issuance volume might have witnessed a decline too as investors turned pessimistic.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s total non-interest income is pegged at $7.23 billion, suggesting a 5.9% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Expenses: Wells Fargo’s costs are expected to have continued flaring up in the second quarter, given its franchise investments in technology and digitalization efforts. Additionally, amid the rising inflation, salary expenses are anticipated to have led to elevated non-interest expenses. This is likely to have hindered bottom-line growth during the quarter under review.Asset Quality: With expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook and growing recession risk, Wells Fargo’s credit quality is likely to have deteriorated. Moreover, given the heighted market volatility, commercial loan defaults are expected to have risen. Hence, as WFC has a substantial exposure to commercial loans, it is likely to increase reserves in the second quarter.What Our Model PredictsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of WFC beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +0.16%.Zacks Rank: WFC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 2.5% downward in the past week to $1.16 per share. Nonetheless, it suggests a year-over-year rise of 56.8%.Also, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues of $20.28 billion indicates a 19.1% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Other Banks That Warrant a LookThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC and M&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB are a couple of bank stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model.The Earnings ESP for PNC is +1.41% and the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

118,3aad46e1-63ad-3c6d-8472-43e9f8c6ee63,WFC,2023-07-08,Wells Fargo (WFC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-reports-next-140007164.html,1688738407,STORY,['WFC'],"[The market expects Wells Fargo (WFC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +56.8%.Revenues are expected to be $20.28 billion, up 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.55% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wells Fargo?For Wells Fargo, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wells Fargo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would post earnings of $1.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of +6.96%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wells Fargo doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The vaccine is approved as a primary series for individuals aged 12 and older and as a booster for those aged 18 and above.The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had previously provided a positive opinion on the vaccine, paving the way for its full authorization.Nuvaxovid initially obtained conditional marketing approval in the EU as a booster dose for adults aged 18 years and above in September 2022. Presently, the vaccine is approved for use in more than 40 global markets.The approval is based on data from the phase III PREVENT-19 study, phase II study and real-world evidence, which have exhibited the efficacy and safety of Nuvaxovid as both primary series and booster dose.This year so far, shares of Novavax have plunged 31.4% against the industry’s 9.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe full approval will provide an approval pathway for an updated vaccine for the upcoming 2023 fall vaccination season.We note that Nuvaxovid has not yet received approval from the FDA in the United States. NVAX is preparing to seek full approval in the United States and other markets. In July 2022, NVAX secured emergency use authorization (EUA) from the agency for the administration of its COVID vaccine in adults.Additionally, the vaccine is authorized as a booster dose for individuals aged 18 and older. In the United States, it is marketed as Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted.Apart from Novavax, other COVID vaccine makers like Pfizer PFE /BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA are currently updating their vaccines to target the XBB lineages. During the FDA committee meeting last month, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax presented their pre-clinical findings supporting the use of their vaccines, which target the XBB.1.5 variant. The pre-clinical data from these manufacturers indicate that a monovalent vaccine is more effective against a bivalent vaccine.Story continuesLast month, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted filings with both the European Medicines Agency and FDA seeking approval for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. If approved, the companies intend to launch their vaccine for the 2023-2024 fall and winter seasons. Pfizer/BioNTech expect to make their updated vaccine ready for supply immediately post-regulatory approvals.Novavax stated that it is manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate at a commercial scale, intended to be in the market during the upcoming fall vaccination campaign. This vaccine is yet to be approved by any regulatory authority across the globe. Novavax aims to make its updated vaccine available and accessible on par with other COVID vaccines.In April, the FDA amended the EUA granted to the mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.Following the EUA amendment, the current bivalent vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna would be used for all doses administered to individuals aged six months and older. Subsequently, the monovalent/original vaccines developed by these companies are no longer authorized for use in the United States. This was done with the intent to simplify the COVID immunization schedule for the majority of the country’s population.Novavax is also making significant advancements in the development of its alternative vaccine candidates, including standalone influenza vaccines, COVID-19-influenza combination vaccines and high-dose COVID jabs.These candidates are presently being evaluated in a phase II clinical study involving older adults aged 50-80 years.Novavax, Inc.

124,1c3c3f47-3953-37b6-b7ac-d4551b0ba473,PYPL,2023-07-08,Focus on These 5 Crypto Stocks for Long-Term Gains,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-5-crypto-stocks-long-132900919.html,1688736540,STORY,"['PYPL', 'HOOD', 'MSTR']","[The cryptocurrency market regained its lost glory this year. The last year was a disappointing one as the Fed pursued aggressive monetary control with a massive hike in the benchmark lending rate to combat 40-year high inflation.A high interest rate is detrimental to growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies. Tighter monetary control also raised concern that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future. Moreover, a series of unfortunate events — mainly the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud leading to the bankruptcy of FTX — also dented market participants’ confidence in digital currency like crypto.The situation reversed this year buoyed by a favorable macro-economic scenario. The Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hikes as inflation dropped steadily. Importantly, in spite of facing tighter monetary control in the past one and a half years, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid. This evaporated the concern of a near-term recession.Finally, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors. BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK) decision to launch a Bitcoin ETF and the decision of The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)-led consortium to create a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, have attracted several investors toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin to name a few.Headwinds PersistDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the economy is not completely out of the woods. The Fed paused rate hikes in its June FOMC meeting after 10 consecutive increases. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that more rate hikes are likely this year as inflation remains elevated, much higher than the central bank’s 2% target.The minutes of the June FOMC meeting showed that Fed members unanimously opined for more rate hike going forward as the inflation rate remains elevated. The June FOMC dot-plot showed that most members were expecting two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each by the end of this year.Story continuesFor example, in the initial hours of trading on Jul 6, the price of Bitcoin touched a 13-month high of $31,450, primarily due to soaring demand from institutional investors. However, extremely strong private sector payroll data for June released by Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) changed the whole scenario.Market participants unanimously infer that a tight labor market — currently the sole concern of the Fed — will compel the central bank to hike rate again. The CME FedWatch is currently showing a 92.5% probability of a 25-basis point interest rate hike in the July FOMC meeting. Consequently, Bitcoin lost its momentum and fell more than 1% from its peak.Long-Term Gains in ViewAt this stage, investors should think from a long-term perspective. Despite more rate hike warnings, the Fed is undoubtedly approaching the end of the higher rate regime. We may not see any rate hike in 2024 and may witness a rate cut at the end of next year if macro-economic data remains favorable.Therefore, investors should accumulate cryptocurrencies using a buy-on-the-dip strategy. Every dip in crypto prices will be a good purchasing point in order to gain handsomely once the Fed’s tighter monetary control comes to an end.Our Stock SelectionWe have narrowed our search to five stocks with solid crypto exposure and strong growth potential.PayPal Holdings Inc.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$12.0bUS$12.8bUS$13.5bUS$14.1bUS$14.6bUS$15.1bUS$15.5bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.77%Est @ 5.37%Est @ 4.39%Est @ 3.71%Est @ 3.23%Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$9.9kUS$9.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.1kUS$8.7kUS$8.2kUS$7.6kUS$7.1kUS$6.7kUS$6.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$83bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$207bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$207b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$78bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$161b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$132, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.357. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Others develop and market information recognition, data entry software, systems and technologies.4 Computer - Integrated Systems Industry Trends in FocusIntegrated Solutions Driving Demand: The industry is benefiting from rising demand for integrated solutions across small, medium and large-scale enterprises as well as increasing investments in IoT, big data, AI and blockchain software technologies. Moreover, business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and security and social businesses present significant opportunities to an increasing number of remote workers in the wake of the coronavirus-induced work-from-home wave. The industry players are anticipated to benefit from recovering global IT spending, as predicted by Gartner.Story continuesSolid Adoption of Multi-Cloud Model: The growing adoption of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is expanding the scope of industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Supply-Chain Bottlenecks and Backlogs: Industry participants are witnessing supply constraints, softness in server demand and cognitive applications, as well as delays in customer acceptance. This is resulting in high backlog levels, particularly in Compute, High Performance Computing &amp; Mass Storage Class and Storage. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange — primarily due to the current macroeconomic scenario and headwinds in emerging markets — does not bode well for the industry.Semiconductor Chip Shortage Mars Prospects: Industry participants are facing challenges stemming from the ongoing and time-consuming business model transition to the cloud. Further, lower spending across Data-Center Systems — primarily due to component shortages like memory and CPUs, as well as deceleration in hyperscale spending — is likely to dampen the prospects of industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

132,380707c9-8f0f-4f70-a25c-3a7ca1eebaab,GM,2023-07-08,Tesla’s China EV price truce shows it’s willing to abide by ‘new rules’,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-china-ev-price-truce-shows-its-willing-to-abide-by-new-rules-180036185.html,1688752836,STORY,"['TSLA', 'VLVCY', 'VLVOF', 'RIVN', 'GM', 'F', 'MBGAF', 'MBGYY']","[Throughout its history, Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have walked to the beat of their own drum. Making electric vehicles on their own when none were available for sale, selling cars directly to customers and sidestepping dealerships — and creating and maintaining Tesla’s own bespoke charging network.These days, as Tesla just recently celebrated its 20-year anniversary as a corporation, the company may be in something of a compromise phase.Take Wednesday’s somewhat unprecedented move in China. As first reported by Bloomberg, Tesla and 15 of its EV rivals in China — including BYD, NIO, Xpeng, and Geely — signed a pact during a ceremony at the China Auto Forum in Shanghai in which the automakers pledged to maintain fair competition and avoid “abnormal pricing.”Apparently, the Chinese government directed the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), the main trade group in the country, to bring the rivals together to sign the pact.To review, Tesla initiated the bitter EV price war in China late last year — and into early this year — with steep price cuts for its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan that forced competitors like BYD and Xpeng to follow suit. The price cuts were so severe, and abrupt, that many Chinese Tesla buyers protested outside Tesla showrooms and delivery centers, demanding refunds.Angry owners: Tesla customers, unhappy with the U.S. carmaker's price cuts last year, discuss their situation at a Tesla delivery centre in Shanghai, China. (REUTERS/Brenda Goh) (Brenda Goh / reuters)Nevertheless, it seems Tesla is now willing to play ball and do what the Chinese government would like to see. Namely, winding down the price war, and protecting local automakers in the world’s largest EV market.“Doing business in China means making the government happy,” said Leland Miller, China Beige Book CEO and an expert on doing business on the mainland. “If Beijing thinks a price war has gone on long enough, then those are the new rules Tesla and everyone else will have to abide by.”Per Bloomberg, Tesla agreed to, among other things, “maintain fair competition and not disrupt fair competition with abnormal pricing,” in addition to “[promoting] core socialist values… and [taking] on the heavy responsibility of maintaining steady growth, strengthening confidence and preventing risks.”Story continuesSigning the pact isn’t exactly the kind of move one would see in CEO Elon Musk’s playbook. He has, for instance, lambasted government programs, including by saying that EV subsidies in the US are not necessary. (Though Tesla took advantage of the tax credits for years.)In this case, compromising with the Chinese government may not actually hurt the company.“Tesla continues to gain market share globally relative to the auto market generally and EV market specifically. This announcement comes at a time when they may feel more comfortable with their relative position,” Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas told Yahoo Finance.A new, more open Tesla?Kinder? Gentler? Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of Twitter. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes) (Gonzalo Fuentes / reuters)Nevertheless, this move, paired with Tesla’s latest collaborations with its Supercharging network, shows that the company is willing to compromise when it sees fit — and when it is financially beneficial. Tesla’s recent partnership with Ford (F) to use its Supercharger network blindsided the industry. Many experts figured Tesla would hold on to that competitive advantage.Tesla's deal with Ford led to other dominos falling: GM (GM), Rivian (RIVN), and Volvo (VLVLY)  also adopted Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and joined its charging network. And just this Friday Tesla added another partner to the mix, as German luxury giant Mercedes-Benz (MBGYY) will now join the Supercharger Network and will include Tesla's NACS port on its EVs starting in 2025.""Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our Supercharger network,"" Musk said, adding that it was an ""honor"" to be working with Ford on charging. (The ""honor"" will likely include some form of payment from Ford, GM, and other partners.)Perhaps a more conciliatory, and maybe even friendly, Tesla will emerge as the company matures — even one that’s willing to work with President Biden and other politicians when it sees fit. Maybe this is why a more compromise-driven Tesla hasn't faced much heat for what appears to be an anti-competitive deal it signed in China.“Politicians in the US have gone out of their way to not be too critical of Elon's dealings in China, presumably because they want support from other areas of his empire, such as SpaceX,” China Beige Book’s Miller said. “I doubt this one will move the needle.”Tesla and Elon Musk may have learned compromise isn’t a dirty word — just as long as it boosts the bottom line.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

While the company’s quarterly earnings are expected to have witnessed a year-over-year decline, its revenues are likely to have increased.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher revenues in the Institutional Clients Group, and Personal Banking and Wealth Management segments. However, the higher cost of credit was a spoilsport.Over the trailing four quarters, C’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate thrice and missed once, the surprise being 12.43%, on average.Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCitigroup Inc. price-eps-surprise | Citigroup Inc. QuoteMajor Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsLoans &amp; Net Interest Income (NII): As the economy cooled down in the quarter,lending activity also slowed. Per the Fed’s latest data, real estate loans, consumer loans, and commercial and industrial loans witnessed muted demand in April and May relative to first-quarter 2023.The Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by another 25 basis points in the quarter under review. Thus, the policy rate reached 5-5.25% in June 2023. While high interest rates typically drive NII for banks, asset-liability mismatches have caused notable damage to the industry.Moreover, Citigroup is expected to have seen rising funding costs due to an unfavorable deposit mix. This, along with waning loan demand, is expected to have taken a toll on its net interest margin (NIM) and NII in the quarter. We project the NII to decline 10.8% sequentially to $11.9 billion for the quarter.Fee Income: Global dealmaking declined year over year in the second quarter, with lower deal volume and total deal value numbers. Stand-off over the U.S. debt ceiling Inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession likely acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals in the quarter.Story continuesNotably, at an industry conference in mid-June, Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citigroup, said that trading revenues and investment banking (IB) revenues had been down 20% and 25%, respectively, from the start of the quarter under review.A year ago, the company’s trading desk benefited from heightening volatility due to interest rate hikes and the Ukraine war. However, the Congressional debate over the debt ceiling affected client activities in the second quarter, dampening the market activity levels.Also, with a more challenging economic environment and a gloomy dealmaking volume, the company’s IB revenues have declined in second-quarter 2023. We anticipate IB income of $726.6 million for the quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest income is pegged at $7.87 billion, indicating a sequential decline of 2.7%.Expenses: Management has been focused on revamping its underlying technology, risk management and internal controls as part of remediation highlighted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. The company has been investing in businesses like wealth management, IB, and treasury and trade solutions.Also, a slowdown in business activities compelled the bank to reduce headcounts primarily in the banking, markets and functions divisions, and manage expenses.Management expected the recent job cuts to cause expenses to climb as much as $400 million in second-quarter 2023 from the first quarter. Mason expects the bank's expenses in the second quarter of 2023 to be $300-$400 million higher sequentially, primarily attributed to severance costs tied to the leaving of 1,600 employees.Hence, expenses are expected to have increased at Citigroup. Our estimate for non-interest expenses stands at $13.73 billion.Asset Quality: With the expectations of an economic slowdown due to macroeconomic headwinds, commercial bankruptcies and card delinquencies are expected to have affected Citigroup’s asset quality in the quarter. With this, C is expected to have built reserves in the second quarter. Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $1.84 billion, whereas it reported a provision of $1.27 billion a year ago.Share Repurchases:The bank suspended common share repurchases from third-quarter 2022 through first-quarter 2023 in anticipation of any temporary negative capital impacts related to the potential sale of Banamex in Mexico. But in the quarter under review, management announced that it expected to repurchase $1 billion in shares for the quarter. Share repurchases during the quarter are expected to have aided bottom-line growth for the company.Key Quarterly DevelopmentsMore than a year after announcing plans to exit Banamex in Mexico, Citigroup decided to pursue an IPO of the business. The bank has been pursuing a carve-out of the ICG business since announcing the plan to exit the business through a sale or a public market alternative. The company expects the separation of the businesses to be completed in the second half of 2024 and the IPO to take place in 2025.Banamex will continue to be reported as part of the bank’s continuing operations until the ownership falls below a 50% voting interest, at which point it will be deconsolidated.What Our Model PredictsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Citigroup beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -7.72%.Zacks Rank: Citigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Prior to the second-quarter earnings release, the company’s earnings estimates have been revised downward, indicating bearish analyst sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of $1.67 has been revised marginally downward over the past week. It suggests a 37% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.44.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $19.67 billion implies a marginal rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for total revenues is pegged at $19.78 billion.Stocks That Warrant a LookM&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Pinnacle West is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IdaCorp has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PNW has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PNW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.11, while IDA has a forward P/E of 20.48. We also note that PNW has a PEG ratio of 3.18. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. IDA currently has a PEG ratio of 5.57.Another notable valuation metric for PNW is its P/B ratio of 1.51. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, IDA has a P/B of 1.86.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help PNW earn a Value grade of B, while IDA has been given a Value grade of D.PNW is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

DUK recently unveiled Kentucky's largest rooftop solar facility with a generation capacity of up to 2 megawatts (MWs). It operates on the top of the 800,000-square-foot Amazon Air Hub.  The solar project, built as part of a joint partnership between Amazon and Duke Energy, should bolster both companies’ clean energy goals.With the entire utility sector rapidly adopting renewables as their preferred energy source, the latest revelation is likely to lead more customers to choose DUK as their electricity provider, boosting its future revenues.DUK’s Transition to Renewable EnergyLike other utilities, Duke Energy boasts a prudent strategy to enhance its clean energy portfolio. The company plans to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050. Notably, DUK’s capital expenditure plan includes investments worth $40 billion for zero-carbon generation, such as solar, wind and battery storage resources, and extending the life of its nuclear fleet over the next decade.  It also plans to bring 3,100 MW of new solar in service by 2028.To promote renewable energy further, the company is targeting the energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% of the total generation by 2030 and exit coal fully by 2035 as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. Such initiatives, including the unveiling of the latest solar plant in Kentucky, will enable DUK to duly meet its target in 2050.Growth ProspectsSolar Energy continues to constitute a major portion of the U.S. renewables market. As stated by Wood Mackenzie in its latest report, solar constituted 54% of the new electricity-generating capacity additions in the nation in the first quarter of 2023, outweighing all other energy sources. Per the Solar Energy Industries Association report, the solar market is projected to triple in size over the next five years.This should benefit Duke Energy and other prominent utility players like Alliant Energy Corp. LNT, PPL Corp. PPL and Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW, which are enhancing their footprint in the U.S. solar market.Alliant Energy is on track to be the fourth largest owner-operator of regulated solar in the United States by 2024. The company plans to add 1.5 GW of solar in 2022-2024. In March 2023, LNT entered into a partnership with Marshalltown YMCA-YWCA to break ground on a 500-kilowatt solar project to be built on donated land in Marshalltown.LNT’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 8% over 2022’s reported figure.In December 2022, PPL Corp.’s subsidiary Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company filed with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve adding nearly 1,000 MWs of solar generation and 125 MWs of battery storage.PPL’s long-term earnings growth rate is 7.4%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.14%.Pinnacle West Capital is expecting to invest $1.34 billion in clean power generation during 2023-2025. At the end of 2022, its principal subsidiary, Arizona Public Service, had a diverse portfolio of 2,418 MW in operation and 1,476 MW under development, including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas.PNW’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 2.1% over 2022’s reported figure.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of DUK have lost 1.6 % against the industry’s 0.6% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

143,e3ec2cb5-eaf1-3924-ac27-8ea5c9c6364f,CSX,2023-07-08,AAR sues Ohio over 2-person train crew law,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aar-sues-ohio-over-2-191155050.html,1688757115,STORY,['CSX'],"[CSX operates in Ohio, where there is a new state law governing train crew sizes. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has filed a lawsuit against the state of Ohio, saying federal law preempts a new state law that dictates a minimum crew size for freight rail operations.Ohio’s law, signed by Gov. Mike DeWine on March 31, requires at least two individuals to be involved in moving a freight train in Ohio. The state may issue civil penalties for violations.A number of federal laws preempt Ohio’s law, argued AAR in a petition filed June 29 with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These include the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 or 3R Act, which came out of freight rail service disruptions in the Northeast and Midwest; the ICC Termination Act, which grants the Surface Transportation Board authority to regulate certain matters; and the Federal Railroad Safety Act.The only Class I railroads that operate in the state are Canadian railway CN (NYSE: CNI), CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC). CSX and NS currently use single-person crews for certain yard operations, including remote control switching operations, AAR said.Ohio law is also more restrictive than a proposed regulation currently before the Federal Railroad Administration on train crew size because FRA’s rule would exempt particular types of trains or trains under specified conditions and has a special approval process for existing one-person crew operations, according to AAR. But Ohio’s law applies to every train or light engine used in connection with the movement of freight, with limited exceptions, AAR said.AAR also cited two studies from consulting firms Oliver Wyman and ICF International, which determined that available safety data and accident rates show no adverse safety impacts resulting from one-person crews versus two-person crews.AAR’s members will “suffer harm to their rights to collectively bargain over crew size. The carriers that operate in Ohio have the right to bargain for system-wide changes in crew size.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns.

He's using the acronym of BEACH stocks, representing the sectors of booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, all eyes have been on big tech stocks this year as the AI hype sent a few mega caps skyrocketing. We have our next guest here that says that there's some underappreciated category of stocks that could outperform tech. He's going with the acronym of BEACH stocks. That stands for booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Global travel and tourism is expected to grow by about 23% this year. But with recession fears weighing on the markets, how much of an upside could we see in this sector? We want to bring back in Ben Laidler.He's eToro Global market strategist. Ben, it's good to see you here. So I know you were just talking about the opportunity that you do still see in tech. But you're also seeing some reason to buy these travel names. What's the catalyst?BEN LAIDLER: The catalyst there is they still got back to what they were making sort of pre-pandemic. So if you like, that sort of reopening trade, I think, still has further to go. Secondly, you know, consumers are in pretty good shape.I mean, we've been talking over 4% wage growth, with inflation, you know, on its way to less than 4%. We're probably going to see it in the inflation numbers next week. So consumers are getting a pay rise.We're getting, you know, 200,000, 300,000, you know, more jobs every month. And the consumers are choosing to spend that money on things that they really care about, you know, like travel. And then on the travel stock side, you're seeing them be very careful at the amount and capacity they add on.They've been very disciplined, which is allowing them to sort of keep pricing. So really, you know, it's the ""Goldilocks"" scenario of, you know, more demand and high prices. And, you know, this is one of the few sectors that's managed to actually outperform tech this year.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: Ben, let's look at the C in your BEACH acronym, the cruise liners. So we have seen some pullback in terms of the targets on the cruise liners. And the cruise liners have certainly performed extremely well, whether you're talking about Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian. How long does this last?BEN LAIDLER: Yeah, so there's definitely some seasonality there. I mean, these types of stocks unsurprisingly do well at this time of the year when, you know, we're all talking about holidays, booking our holidays, going on our holidays. But again, I think, you know, just to zoom back out, that reopening recovery story I still think has, you know, further to go.You know, very few of these sectors are making as much money or are seeing as much demand as they saw back in 2019. So again, I still think demand has further to recover. And again, you're seeing this sort of double benefit because the holding pricing, you know, reasonably firm as well.And, you know, all of these sectors aren't particularly expensive either. You know, the pushback against tech is it's very expensive. A lot of these stocks, you know, earnings are still depressed, but valuations are also, you know, quite low. So I think they have room to run.SEANA SMITH: Ben, dips like we could potentially see today with futures under pressure-- we certainly have seen the market under pressure over the last couple of trading days-- should investors be using those dips as an opportunity to buy? It sounds like it. And is it just that sector in terms of the travel names? You also mentioned tech. Where else are you seeing that opportunity?BEN LAIDLER: Yes, I think the fundamentals justify, you know, buying the dips. But don't just take it from me. I think the other people that are going to be buying the dips here are all the bears. And there's a lot of them, and they're running on an awful lot of cash.And I think, you know, the reason that these sell-offs are not going to be particularly big if and when they come is not only, I think, that the fundamentals are still becoming less bad, but also, you know, these investors have been completely wrong footed this year. But carrying too much cash will be, I think, stepping up and narrowing those positions.But to answer your question, what should people be buying, you know, I don't think we're out of the woods yet. I mean, inflation, you know, is sticky. We still have an economic slowdown to come. So, you know, be invested.I still think the biggest risk is not being in the market, but be reasonably defensive. And I think, you know, these defensive growth names, so health care, you know, big tech, these big stocks, which may not sound defensive, but I actually think they are, given, you know, the demand and supply, you know, dynamic-- so I think it's these sort of long-duration sectors, things that are going to do well if inflation comes down, if interest rates come down. And the things I'd be steering clear of are these sort of value trap cyclicals, which are very exposed, I think, to the economic slowdown, so small caps, industrials, commodities.DIANE KING HALL: So are you saying that small caps would carry too much risk or too much exposure in the second half of the year?BEN LAIDLER: I think so. I mean, these sectors are very cheap. You know, we know that there's a slowdown coming. You know, they underperformed. They degraded. But I don't see a reason to buy them now ahead of an economic slowdown.I think it's a slowdown. I don't think it's a recession. But I think that's still a better environment for these sort of health care, for big tech, which, by the way, you know, dominate the stock market. You know, they don't dominate the economy. They dominate the stock market. So this is another-- you know, the stock market is not the economy. I think the stock market will probably do better than the economy in the next sort of six to nine months because it's full of these sort of defensive growth sectors, and it is not full of, you know, small caps and commodities, which are, you know, much bigger in the real economy.DIANE KING HALL: All right, we're walking the tight rope here. Ben Laidler, stay with us.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the latest news, and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today.  Investors are talking about the latest jobs report released on July 7. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, below Wall Street expectations. The Federal Reserve is actively watching the labor market since employment data is key when it comes to deciding the future trajectory of rate hikes.The ADP’s National Employment Report that was released in the first week of July showed that the private sector had added 497,000 jobs in June. This was more than two times the economists' predictions of 228,000 jobs and a significantly higher jump over May's figure of 267,000 new hires. Within this dataset, mid-sized businesses (those with up to 250 employees) added the most jobs, with the largest firms actually seeing a decline in employment. Industry wise, it was the leisure and hospitality industry that added the most jobs, with firms in the financial and manufacturing industries seeing a decrease in employment.However, for the stock market bulls, pay gains for both those staying in their jobs and for those switching their roles slowed down, indicating that firms are feeling the heat in a high interest rate environment. The contrast between the private sector adding more jobs and a hint of a potential slowdown in the labor market continued in the Labor Department's unemployment claims data for the week ending on July 1st. This data showed that the initial claims jumped to 248,000 - increasing by 12,000 over the previous week's data. The unemployment rate also stood unchanged at 1.2%. Data for the claims ended up beating economist estimates of 245,000 - showing that they were being conservative in estimating a slowing market.Story continuesGetting right back to work after the holiday, the Labor Department dumped another set of data on investors. This data came in the form of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report. Covering the state of the labor market for May, this data showed that on the last business day of May, job openings had dropped to 9.8 million with the number of people quitting their jobs also increasing but layoffs remaining relatively the same. Crucially, though, the job openings rate also declined in May, sitting at 5.9% after its 6.2% reading in April. Cumulatively, the data hints at the fact that perhaps the labor market has peaked and is finding it difficult to battle the Fed's ten interest rate hikes so far.Amidst this backdrop, one way to play the stock market is by focusing on the technicals. These involve studying different stock trends, such as share price averages, the number of people trading the shares, and the extent of market interest in the shares. Cumulatively, these enable one to paint a bigger picture of a stock to see whether any potential negative or positive interest in it will carry into the coming months and present an opportunity for making a profit.As to what lies in the future for the stock market, particularly in the aftermath of the strong gains made during H1 2023, here's what Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist of CFRA Research has on his mind:Well I think that we're likely to see a positive second half. I mean traditionally a strong first half ends up serving as a running start to the second half. Typically we're up about 4.5% in the second half since world war two, rising about 70% of the time, but if you have the first half that's up more than 10% and this one was up, higher than 15%, then you end up with about an 8% gain on average, rising in price about 82% of the time. So, basically what it says is that those portfolio managers that were underperforming the market, put the pedal to the metal and tried to catch up.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying, with some top picks being Meta Platforms, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns. In this article, we have compiled a list of some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.14 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of the first quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

Shares have added about 7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Semtech due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Semtech Q1 Earnings Beat EstimatesSemtech Corporation first-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings of 2 cents per share compares favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents per share. However, the reported earnings decreased by 97.5% year over year.Net sales of $236.54 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $234 million. The same increased by 17% from the prior-year quarter’s level.Top-line growth was driven by the strength of the company’s IoT System. Also, the growing momentum in the industrial market contributed well.However, weakening momentum across infrastructure and consumer end markets and softness in Signal Integrity and Advanced Protection and Sensing product lines were concerns.Revenues by End MarketSales from the infrastructure market were $39 million (16% of net sales), which exhibited a decline of 49% year over year.Sales from the industrial market were $175.9 million (75% of net sales), up 125% from the prior-year period’s level.Sales from the high-end consumer market were $21.6 million (9% of net sales), declining 55% year over year.Revenues by Product LinesSignal Integrity (18% of net sales) sales were $41.6 million in the reported quarter, down 47.5% year over year.Advanced Sensing and Protection (15% of net sales) sales were $36.06 million, down 50.2% from the prior-year quarter.IoT System (57% of net sales) sales were $134.6 million, increasing 166.9% on a year-over-year basis.IoT Connected Services (10% of net sales) sales were $24.3 million in the reported quarter.Story continuesOperating ResultsNon-GAAP gross margin of 48.5% contracted from 64.8% reported in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter increased 28.1% to $46.2 million from the last fiscal year’s quarterly number. Adjusted product development and engineering expenses increased 33.7% from the year-ago quarter to $46.5 million.The non-GAAP operating margin of 9.3% contracted significantly from 29.8% reported in the last fiscal year quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Apr 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $164.2 million, down from $235.5 million as of Jan 29, 2023.Account receivables for the reported fiscal first-quarter 2024 were $145.4 million, down from $161.7 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Long-term debt was $1.34 billion, significantly higher than $1.29 billion in the previous fiscal quarter.In the reported fiscal quarter, the company used $89.9 million of cash in operations compared with $18.8 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow in the fiscal first quarter was an outflow of $103.96 million.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2024, management expects net sales of $233-$243 million.The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 47.5-49.5%. Also, management projects SG&amp;A expenses of $45-$47 million and research and development costs of $44-$46 million.The non-GAAP-based bottom-line is expected in the band of $(0.02)-$0.06 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 6.06% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Semtech has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Semtech has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSemtech is part of the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry. Over the past month, Analog Devices (ADI), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.5%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended April 2023 more than a month ago.Analog Devices reported revenues of $3.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.8%.

FIS agreed to divest a majority stake in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business, its merchant payments arm, to the private equity firm, GTCR. The deal puts the business’ value at $18.5 billion. The company also provided a preview of its second-quarter results.Per the deal, Fidelity National will divest 55% of the business to GTCR and retain the remaining 45%. The company will receive net proceeds of $11.7 billion from the transaction. FIS acquired Worldpay through a deal valued at around $43 billion, including debt, in 2019. However, the business took a hit, losing market share to Fintech startups and traditional competitors.The deal marks one of the largest corporate carve-outs and is expected to close by the March quarter of 2024. After completion, Fidelity National’s ownership interest in the business will likely be reported in income from minority interest. The move is expected to simplify operations for the company. It will likely utilize the proceeds from the deal to reduce the debt burden and buy back shares. It had long-term debt, excluding the current portion, of $13,905 million at the first-quarter end.GTCR, which has arranged debt financing from multiple banks for the transaction, is expected to make additional investments of up to $1.25 billion in Worldpay to unlock inorganic growth opportunities. The business is expected to gain from the acquirer’s resources and expertise and enjoy the freedom of being a privately held firm. Charles Drucker, Worldpay’s former CEO will lead the business following the close of the deal.The partial monetization of the Merchant Solutions business is expected to create greater value for FIS, which plans to maintain a solid commercial relationship following the move. Last year, Worldpay witnessed payments volume of $2 trillion.2Q23 ExpectationsFidelity National also announced that it expects its second-quarter revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to be above the mid-point of the guided ranges.

(V) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-visa-inc-v-130012246.html,1688734812,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this global payments processor have returned +7.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.7%. The $32.52 billion and $36.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +10.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

It is worth considering McKesson (MCK), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry.When looking at the last two reports, this prescription drug distributor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.63%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, McKesson was expected to post earnings of $7.16 per share, but it reported $7.19 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.42%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.34 per share, while it actually produced $6.90 per share, a surprise of 8.83%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for McKesson. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 2, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global video streaming industry, you can directly go to the 5 Most Profitable TV Shows of All Time.An Analysis of Global Video Streaming Industry Global video streaming has changed the dynamics of the industry. OTT streaming platforms have more viewership than traditional TV channels. Netflix and Amazon Prime are two of the biggest examples in modern time. According to a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global video streaming market size is projected to grow from $554.33 billion in 2023 to $1.90 trillion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 19.3%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when everyone was in lockdown, streaming platforms gained massive viewership. Although streaming was growing swiftly pre-COVID, the pandemic accelerated viewership. The report shows that streaming traffic increased by 26% during 2020 around the world. Overall, the pandemic has had a positive impact on the video streaming industry. North America is expected to dominate the video streaming market share over the forecasted period, led by video streaming giants Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).Digging into Old TV ShowsSince the invention of television, TV shows have evolved over time, and so have the trends and nature of the audience. Some of the most classic TV shows were once among the most anticipated TV shows. During the late 90s, the media industry was less competitive, but with the emergence of more media companies, the competition started to soar. Going back to the 60s and 70s, there weren't many options for TV shows, compared to what we have today. A notable TV show of the time was M*A*S*H, which was produced by Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) in 1972, and made tons of money. M*A*S*H finale is among the most watched TV show episodes of all time, with over 105 million viewers tuning in at the time it was aired in 1983. M*A*S*H's sales are remarkable, considering that time period.Story continuesThe Biggest Streaming PlatformNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) initially began with the idea to produce global shows. With time, trends have changed and the streaming platform has focused on improving local content.Squid Games remains one of the most watched TV series on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Viewers worldwide have spent around 1.65 billion hours watching Squid Games’ Season 1. Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) most recent shows have been local hits and that is the reason we are seeing more non-English shows getting popular among Netflix viewers. For example, Money Heist is a Spanish show that became a global hit. Narcos is another prime example for which the company paid $2.5 million per episode of Season 1, with an accumulated deal of $25 million for the season.Rising inflation has had an impact on the global economy. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) users used to share passwords and the company has started to crack down on password sharing. Despite this, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced better than expected outcomes for Q1 2023. On April 18, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $2.88, beating the EPS estimates of $2.86. The company's revenue soared to $8.16 billion, compared to $7.87 billion a year ago. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) added 1.75 million subscribers during the first quarter of 2023. However, the company expects membership growth to drop in the upcoming quarters. During its Q1 2023 earnings call, the company made some comments on this:""While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a better outcome from both our members and our business.""In addition, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is planning to refine its pricing strategy for different regions. The earnings call comments further add:""We talked for the last few quarters about further refining our pricing strategy and monetization. And if you think back to when we did our global launch in 2016, it was pretty much across the board, a bit of a skim approach and not particularly sophisticated in terms of our pricing.So think of this as kind of that next step in our evolution of a bit of a better market fit, product market fit, pricing fit, with the aim of growing our penetration in these markets and also better medium and long-term revenue. So better for our members, better for our business.But just want to emphasize, this is not a material to our business anytime in the near-term for sure. So it’s a lot of countries, but it represents less than 5% of our revenue and so it’s something that will -- over the long-term, hopefully, will benefit us and we can point to an example of success is sort of like what we saw in India.""Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) expects to reach a content spend limit of $17 billion by 2024. It may depend on revenue generation as well. ""We expect to be back to about the $17 billion level in 2024 and the rate of growth depends on the rate of revenue growth for sure.""In comparison, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) expects its content spend on company-wide projects to remain in the low $30 billion range. The company during Q1 2023 made comments on their expected budget:""We still expect cash content spend company-wide to remain in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. The longer-term content cost reductions referenced earlier in the call are not expected to impact this year's guidance range. We also continue to invest in our parks and experiences globally and in other capital ticks across the enterprise and expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6.7 billion primarily due to decreases in CapEx on our domestic parks, reflecting, in part, some timing shifts.""Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) remains one of the biggest streaming companies in the world. Other prominent streaming giants include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Amazon Prime, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) with Disney+, and HBO with HBO Max owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). These streaming giants dominate the industry and will continue to produce the most profitable TV shows in the world.25 Most Profitable TV Shows of all timeCopyright: lculig / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo collect data for the 25 most profitable TV shows of all time, we consulted five sources including IMDb, Rolling Stone, IGN, Collider, and Movieweb. While searching for the most profitable TV shows of all time, it was not easy to determine the profitability and net revenue of TV shows from different periods. We tried to look for the TV shows with the most number of watch hours and assume their profitability based on watch hours. However, it was hard to track the watch hours of a particular show as it is difficult to compare shows across decades. So, we picked the top 5 shows from every index until we had our list of 25 most profitable TV shows. When we found repeated shows among the top 5, we picked the top sixth show and so on. Our hypothesis is, a show that appears higher on a list was more popular among consumers, and therefore, made more profit for the stakeholders involved. We ranked these TV series in ascending order of their number of appearances in the aforementioned sources. 25 Most Protifable TV Shows of All Time25.

He's using the acronym of BEACH stocks, representing the sectors of booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, all eyes have been on big tech stocks this year as the AI hype sent a few mega caps skyrocketing. We have our next guest here that says that there's some underappreciated category of stocks that could outperform tech. He's going with the acronym of BEACH stocks. That stands for booking, entertainment, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels.Global travel and tourism is expected to grow by about 23% this year. But with recession fears weighing on the markets, how much of an upside could we see in this sector? We want to bring back in Ben Laidler.He's eToro Global market strategist. Ben, it's good to see you here. So I know you were just talking about the opportunity that you do still see in tech. But you're also seeing some reason to buy these travel names. What's the catalyst?BEN LAIDLER: The catalyst there is they still got back to what they were making sort of pre-pandemic. So if you like, that sort of reopening trade, I think, still has further to go. Secondly, you know, consumers are in pretty good shape.I mean, we've been talking over 4% wage growth, with inflation, you know, on its way to less than 4%. We're probably going to see it in the inflation numbers next week. So consumers are getting a pay rise.We're getting, you know, 200,000, 300,000, you know, more jobs every month. And the consumers are choosing to spend that money on things that they really care about, you know, like travel. And then on the travel stock side, you're seeing them be very careful at the amount and capacity they add on.They've been very disciplined, which is allowing them to sort of keep pricing. So really, you know, it's the ""Goldilocks"" scenario of, you know, more demand and high prices. And, you know, this is one of the few sectors that's managed to actually outperform tech this year.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: Ben, let's look at the C in your BEACH acronym, the cruise liners. So we have seen some pullback in terms of the targets on the cruise liners. And the cruise liners have certainly performed extremely well, whether you're talking about Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian. How long does this last?BEN LAIDLER: Yeah, so there's definitely some seasonality there. I mean, these types of stocks unsurprisingly do well at this time of the year when, you know, we're all talking about holidays, booking our holidays, going on our holidays. But again, I think, you know, just to zoom back out, that reopening recovery story I still think has, you know, further to go.You know, very few of these sectors are making as much money or are seeing as much demand as they saw back in 2019. So again, I still think demand has further to recover. And again, you're seeing this sort of double benefit because the holding pricing, you know, reasonably firm as well.And, you know, all of these sectors aren't particularly expensive either. You know, the pushback against tech is it's very expensive. A lot of these stocks, you know, earnings are still depressed, but valuations are also, you know, quite low. So I think they have room to run.SEANA SMITH: Ben, dips like we could potentially see today with futures under pressure-- we certainly have seen the market under pressure over the last couple of trading days-- should investors be using those dips as an opportunity to buy? It sounds like it. And is it just that sector in terms of the travel names? You also mentioned tech. Where else are you seeing that opportunity?BEN LAIDLER: Yes, I think the fundamentals justify, you know, buying the dips. But don't just take it from me. I think the other people that are going to be buying the dips here are all the bears. And there's a lot of them, and they're running on an awful lot of cash.And I think, you know, the reason that these sell-offs are not going to be particularly big if and when they come is not only, I think, that the fundamentals are still becoming less bad, but also, you know, these investors have been completely wrong footed this year. But carrying too much cash will be, I think, stepping up and narrowing those positions.But to answer your question, what should people be buying, you know, I don't think we're out of the woods yet. I mean, inflation, you know, is sticky. We still have an economic slowdown to come. So, you know, be invested.I still think the biggest risk is not being in the market, but be reasonably defensive. And I think, you know, these defensive growth names, so health care, you know, big tech, these big stocks, which may not sound defensive, but I actually think they are, given, you know, the demand and supply, you know, dynamic-- so I think it's these sort of long-duration sectors, things that are going to do well if inflation comes down, if interest rates come down. And the things I'd be steering clear of are these sort of value trap cyclicals, which are very exposed, I think, to the economic slowdown, so small caps, industrials, commodities.DIANE KING HALL: So are you saying that small caps would carry too much risk or too much exposure in the second half of the year?BEN LAIDLER: I think so. I mean, these sectors are very cheap. You know, we know that there's a slowdown coming. You know, they underperformed. They degraded. But I don't see a reason to buy them now ahead of an economic slowdown.I think it's a slowdown. I don't think it's a recession. But I think that's still a better environment for these sort of health care, for big tech, which, by the way, you know, dominate the stock market. You know, they don't dominate the economy. They dominate the stock market. So this is another-- you know, the stock market is not the economy. I think the stock market will probably do better than the economy in the next sort of six to nine months because it's full of these sort of defensive growth sectors, and it is not full of, you know, small caps and commodities, which are, you know, much bigger in the real economy.DIANE KING HALL: All right, we're walking the tight rope here. Ben Laidler, stay with us.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns.

A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital via share buybacks and dividends.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins.

188,fa76c494-f80d-3483-a316-26ae2b1c4914,PSA,2023-07-08,Why You Should Retain Public Storage (PSA) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-retain-public-storage-psa-155700280.html,1688745420,STORY,"['PSA', 'VTR', 'EGP']","[Public Storage PSA is well poised to gain from its high brand value, strategic acquisitions, presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet amid favorable self-storage industry fundamentals. However, the development boom in many markets and a high interest rate scenario are major concerns.Public Storage is among the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The brand stands out as one of the preeminent and well-established names in the self-storage sector. With significant market share in major metropolitan centers, the company is poised to capitalize on the economies of scale, apart from leveraging on its brand recognition.The self-storage asset category is need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Moreover, demand for self-storage spaces has shot up amid remote and hybrid work modes, elevated home sales, and remodeling and the migration in and out of metropolitan markets. Amid these tailwinds, we estimate total revenues to increase 7% year over year in 2023.In addition, Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. From the beginning of 2021 through Mar 31, 2023, the company acquired 311 facilities, with 27 million net rentable square feet, for $5.9 billion. Following Mar 31, 2023, the company acquired or was under contract to buy 12 self-storage facilities spanning 0.9 million net rentable square feet of space across five states for $139 million.Public Storage maintains a strong financial profile characterized by solid credit metrics, including low leverage relative to its total capitalization and operating cash flows. Its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market. Additionally, Public Storage’s current cash flow growth is projected at 96.40% compared with the 10.63% growth projected for the industry. With solid balance-sheet strength, the company is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Moreover, Public Storage has consistently paid dividends and continued with its payment even during the pandemic. In February 2023, it announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend from $2 per common share to $3. Backed by robust operating fundamentals and industry tailwinds, we anticipate core FFO to improve 5% in 2023, 4.4% in 2024 and 6% in 2025. Looking at the company’s core FFO growth projections, financial position and a lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry’s average, its current dividend is expected to be sustainable.Over the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 2.7% against the industry’s fall of 3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from several private, regional and local operators. This is expected to fuel competition for the company, affecting occupancies, curbing its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Furthermore, with the abatement of the pandemic's impact, tenants are returning to their usual move-out patterns, leading to a rise in the number of people vacating their properties. This is also likely to limit rental rate growth in many markets. For 2023, we estimate weighted average square foot occupancy to be 92.6%.Also, a high interest rate is a concern for Public Storage. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. For 2023, we expect interest expenses to increase 29.9% year over year.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked stocks worth considering are Ventas VTR and EastGroup Properties EGP, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ventas’ current-year funds from operations (FFO) has been revised marginally upward over the last 60 days. In the past three months, VTR shares have rallied 9.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EastGroup Properties’ current-year FFO has been revised marginally upward over the last 60 days.

FIS agreed to divest a majority stake in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business, its merchant payments arm, to the private equity firm, GTCR. The deal puts the business’ value at $18.5 billion. The company also provided a preview of its second-quarter results.Per the deal, Fidelity National will divest 55% of the business to GTCR and retain the remaining 45%. The company will receive net proceeds of $11.7 billion from the transaction. FIS acquired Worldpay through a deal valued at around $43 billion, including debt, in 2019. However, the business took a hit, losing market share to Fintech startups and traditional competitors.The deal marks one of the largest corporate carve-outs and is expected to close by the March quarter of 2024. After completion, Fidelity National’s ownership interest in the business will likely be reported in income from minority interest. The move is expected to simplify operations for the company. It will likely utilize the proceeds from the deal to reduce the debt burden and buy back shares. It had long-term debt, excluding the current portion, of $13,905 million at the first-quarter end.GTCR, which has arranged debt financing from multiple banks for the transaction, is expected to make additional investments of up to $1.25 billion in Worldpay to unlock inorganic growth opportunities. The business is expected to gain from the acquirer’s resources and expertise and enjoy the freedom of being a privately held firm. Charles Drucker, Worldpay’s former CEO will lead the business following the close of the deal.The partial monetization of the Merchant Solutions business is expected to create greater value for FIS, which plans to maintain a solid commercial relationship following the move. Last year, Worldpay witnessed payments volume of $2 trillion.2Q23 ExpectationsFidelity National also announced that it expects its second-quarter revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to be above the mid-point of the guided ranges. Previously, the company projected second-quarter revenues to remain between $3,675 million and $3,725 million, while adjusted EPS was estimated to be in the $1.45-$1.50 band.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of Fidelity National have gained 8% in the past three months compared with the 6.4% rise of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksFidelity National currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying McDonald's, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MCD a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $11.06.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's.

197,cf087b54-2fe7-348c-802c-76768f303273,PCAR,2023-07-08,Paccar (PCAR) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-pcar-great-momentum-stock-160007949.html,1688745607,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Paccar (PCAR), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PCAR that show why this truck maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PCAR, shares are up 6.64% over the past week while the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry is up 5.26% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.66% compares favorably with the industry's 0.53% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Paccar have risen 14.29%, and are up 49.23% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.85% and 16.42%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PCAR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PCAR is averaging 1,959,524 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PCAR.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PCAR's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.83 to $7.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PCAR is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Paccar on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 US Companies With The Highest Profit Margins.In the dynamic landscape of the United States business sector, several companies like JP Morgan, Apple, Microsoft,, among others, have emerged as beacons of profitability, boasting significant profit margins that set them apart from their competitors. These organizations have honed their strategies, capitalized on market trends, and demonstrated unparalleled operational efficiency, culminating in impressive financial success. Through astute decision-making, relentless innovation, and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction, these US companies have achieved extraordinary profitability and solidified their positions as industry leaders. This article will explore some top-performing companies in the United States, highlighting their significant profit margins and the key factors contributing to their exceptional financial performance. Investing in US Companies with High-Profit Margins: Opportunities and Risks Investing in US companies with high-profit margins can be brilliant for anyone wanting to build wealth. That being said, it's crucial to consider the potential risks involved. For instance, high-profit margins can attract competition, leading to decreased profits over time. Additionally, market conditions can change, impacting the demand for a company's products or services. Before making any investment decisions, conducting thorough research on a company's financials, market position, and competition is essential. For example, let's look at Apple Inc., known for its high-profit margins. In 2022 the company's net income was $99.8 billion, and its gross margin was 43.3%. However, it's important to note that Apple faces competition from other tech giants like Samsung and Huawei, which could impact its future profits. Story continuesAnother company to consider is Amazon. In 2022 the company's net income was $-2.72 billion, a net loss, but its gross margin was 43.8%. Amazon is the dominant player in the e-commerce market but faces competition from other retailers like Walmart and Target.  Market Trends and Future Outlook for US Companies with High-Profit Margins US companies with high-profit margins like Bank of America, Visa, and, Microsoft, among others, proactively monitor market trends and adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the companies' environmental impact and prefer businesses prioritizing sustainability. Around 66% of US consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products. As a result, high-profit-margin US companies are investing in sustainable practices and products to meet this demand. In this regard, you can read more about which companies are the best in terms of ESG in our list of the most ethical companies in the US.Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed the business landscape. More consumers opt for online shopping, prompting companies with high-profit margins to invest in their online presence and provide seamless purchasing experiences on their websites. In 2022, e-commerce sales in the US reached $1.03 trillion. Looking ahead, the future appears promising for US companies with high-profit margins. As the economy recovers, these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for superior products and services. By staying attuned to market trends and embracing innovation, these companies can continue to thrive and expand in the coming years. International Expansion: Profit Margin Considerations for US Companies Regarding international expansion, US companies must carefully consider their profit margins. While expanding globally can offer tremendous growth opportunities, it also comes with significant costs and risks. For example, companies may face higher taxes, tariffs, and shipping expenses when operating in foreign markets. Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and legal requirements can all add complexity and cost to international operations. To maximize profit margins, US companies must carefully evaluate the potential costs and risks of expanding abroad and develop a comprehensive strategy for managing these challenges. Exports accounted for 10.98% of the US GDP in 2021, highlighting the importance of international expansion for US businesses, which may involve partnering with local businesses, investing in supply chain optimization, or adapting products and services to meet local market demands. Ultimately, success in international expansion requires a careful balance of risk and reward and a deep understanding of each target market's unique challenges and opportunities. 25 US Companies With The Highest Profit MarginsOur methodology  Our methodology involved ranking the top most profitable US companies based on their profit margins in ascending order for 2022.

That strike lasted 15 days, cost the company $850 million, and sent some customers to rivalsBoth union and company officials have said they want a deal to prevent a strike, which could put millions of daily deliveries at risk.After missing out on wage increases during the pandemic, unions are aggressively seeking higher pay and better working conditions, pushing back on contract offers from companies grappling with labor shortages.Su recently helped negotiate a crucial contract deal between U.S. West Coast seaport employers and a union representing 22,000 workers.(Reporting by Kanishka Singh and Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by David Holmes and David Gregorio)]"

Julie Su, Acting U.S Labor Secretary, sits down with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger to discuss the report, unemployment, and the U.S. labor force.Su said, ""This jobs report represents steady and stable growth, which is what we want in the economy.""Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Jennifer Schonberger. Well, with the Labor Department report coming in a bit softer than expected on that top line payroll number, 209,000 versus the 230,000 expected.But on the flip side, the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.6%. And wage growth coming in stronger than expected at 4.4%. For more analysis on this, I want to bring in acting Labor Secretary Julie Su. Secretary Su, thank you so much for joining me. It's great to be with you at the Labor Department.JULIE SU: Thank you, Jennifer. Good to be with you.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: So we did see a little bit of softening on that top line payroll number, 209,000. And we saw some revisions downward for April and May. So we're in the 200,000 range, a bit softer than the 300,000 print we had been seeing historically. Do you think that the Fed's 10 interest rate hikes are finally starting to cool the job market?JULIE SU: Well, this is a good jobs report. This jobs report represents steady and stable growth, which is what we want in the economy, right? That is part of President Biden's economic plan, is to make sure that there is steady growth.He's helped shepherd a recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. And now, we see continued growth. And combine that with the 3.6% unemployment rate, which, you know, for the last 17 months straight, unemployment has been less than 4%.It hasn't been like that since the 1960s. And so those combined figures really demonstrate that President Biden's economic policies are working. And what we do want is that steady, stable growth, as represented by today's report.Story continuesJENNIFER SCHONBERGER: To your point, as far as strength is concerned, we saw wage growth at 4.4%, still very strong, still seeing a lot of demand for workers in this economy, especially in the services sector. How much of that strength do you think is being driven by lingering effects from the pandemic, lower immigration, early retirements? How long do you think that's going to persist?JULIE SU: That's right. So we are in a tight labor market, right? In a tight labor market, workers have more power. They have more choice. They have the ability to move from jobs to better jobs. And we've certainly seen that since the president came into office.But we've also seen a return to pre-pandemic labor force participation rates, especially in that prime-age workforce, from 25 to 54. And that is also a sign of a strong economy, of people having confidence, of people coming into labor market looking for jobs and getting jobs. And those are all good things.And we certainly see that overall, but for women, we see that women have now marked a third straight month of the highest labor force participation rate for that age group in 75 years. These are all signs of strength. It's a sign of Bidenomics, having the effect that we had. And all these things really frankly defy expectations.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: How much longer do you think that workers are going to keep the upper hand here, and we're going to see these trends persist before the Fed finally starts to cool the job market?JULIE SU: Right. So I don't want to speak to Fed policy, right? But certainly, what we are really committed to here at the Department of Labor and across the Biden-Harris administration is making sure that additional investments are creating good jobs in every community and also bringing industry to the US, right? We're focused on manufacturing. We've had almost 800,000 manufacturing jobs created since the president came into office, and we're just getting started.We have infrastructure investments. We have semiconductor and chips. So all of these things are about delivering things for the American people and also creating good jobs in every community. And again, today's report is a sign that that kind of stable growth is not only possible, but it is actually happening under President Biden.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: You mentioned women, women's participation in the labor force at a record high, above 77%. Yet women's wages, if you look at women versus men, they're only earning $0.83 on the dollar versus men. And we're talking about women in full-time jobs here. Why is that gap still persisting? And what can be done to really close that?JULIE SU: Yeah, thank you for mentioning that, Jennifer, because we talk about women helping to power this recovery, right? And women, as always, are doing our part. But there remain systemic issues that affect women.Obviously, some of it is care and the cost of care, something the president has talked about a lot. There's also occupational segregation that leads to the gender wage gap. And we see this moment-- and the president has been crystal clear about his commitment to equity. Leave no one behind. Make sure every community, you know, comes along in the growth that we have.And so part of it is the jobs that we're creating, we want to make sure that women have access to those jobs, that they have the training that they need to, you know, participate in manufacturing, in construction, right, in all of the growth that's happening. And so those are priorities that we have. When the president says, we need to finish the job, we have more work to do, that is part of what he means.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Is the president, is the administration looking to put in place any further policies to maybe help with childcare or help women who want to participate in the workforce or participate in jobs that would allow them to aspire for higher-paying positions?JULIE SU: Absolutely. So the president has called for policies, right? Like paid leave. He's indicated the importance of care work and making care both affordable and care jobs good jobs because most of those jobs are also done by women. One of the things we are focused on at the Department of Labor is creating workforce development programs, where we bring in workers and employers to focus on how we create opportunities for women.And what we've seen is when we do that, women step up, right? Women do these jobs. And it helps to close that gap.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Switching gears, Secretary, UPS drivers are potentially on the verge of a strike. Teamsters, the labor union that represents more than half of UPS workers, some 340,000 workers, has come to an impasse with the company. Are you prepared to intervene?Are you talking with parties at all? And if there were to be a strike, what kind of impact would we see on the job market and the economy, just given how integral UPS is to supply chains and companies that are relying on that company to get customers their products and packages?JULIE SU: Right. That's such a good point about, you know, the importance of the work that UPS workers have done and the importance of what that company's done. You know, throughout the pandemic, right, there was an increased demand for package delivery, and UPS workers stepped up to do that. I believe, as the president believes, that the collective bargaining process works, that parties coming together at the table and bargaining for wages and working conditions and benefits and the like, that that is a process that we should respect.That's a process that has historically delivered not only gains for the people at the table, but to create the middle class, right? Unions made the middle class. That's something the president says all the time. And so I have faith that the parties are going to find a path and continue to try to work things out and that there are win-win solutions, as we found when I went to the ports, to help--JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: But just standing back at this point, you're not intervening?JULIE SU: Right. We believe in the collective bargaining process, and we believe that the parties need to be given room to do what they know how to do best.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: And before I let you go, Secretary, sticking with the union trend, the UAW, their collective bargaining agreement is set to expire with the Detroit Three automakers in mid-September. President Biden has appointed a advisor, Gene Sperling. I know he's working very closely with you. How are talks going? Are you prepared to intervene to stop any striking if it were to occur?JULIE SU: So I am working very closely with the White House. You know, this White House has been very-- this administration has been very collaborative around a whole host of issues. I think that's a premature question, right?I think the broader issue, which is consistent with jobs today, is that jobs are growing. You know, workers have come back to the labor market. And bargaining is taking place because in a tight labor market, workers have more power.And that's all a good thing because that's how we create an economy, from the bottom up, in the middle out, right? That's how we make sure that every job is a good job. That's how we make sure that we honor what workers have done and their power in the workplace. And, you know, I think those are all part of the Bidenomics vision of what makes a good strong economy.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Secretary Su, thank you so much for your insight. It was great to have you on the program.JULIE SU: Thank you so much, Jennifer.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: I hope to speak with you again soon. Thank you me too.]"

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.NiSource (NI) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this energy holding company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for NiSource is 2.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 8.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.2%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for NiSource is 15.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 4.1%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for NiSource. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made NiSource a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions NiSource well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DUK recently unveiled Kentucky's largest rooftop solar facility with a generation capacity of up to 2 megawatts (MWs). It operates on the top of the 800,000-square-foot Amazon Air Hub.  The solar project, built as part of a joint partnership between Amazon and Duke Energy, should bolster both companies’ clean energy goals.With the entire utility sector rapidly adopting renewables as their preferred energy source, the latest revelation is likely to lead more customers to choose DUK as their electricity provider, boosting its future revenues.DUK’s Transition to Renewable EnergyLike other utilities, Duke Energy boasts a prudent strategy to enhance its clean energy portfolio. The company plans to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050. Notably, DUK’s capital expenditure plan includes investments worth $40 billion for zero-carbon generation, such as solar, wind and battery storage resources, and extending the life of its nuclear fleet over the next decade.  It also plans to bring 3,100 MW of new solar in service by 2028.To promote renewable energy further, the company is targeting the energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% of the total generation by 2030 and exit coal fully by 2035 as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. Such initiatives, including the unveiling of the latest solar plant in Kentucky, will enable DUK to duly meet its target in 2050.Growth ProspectsSolar Energy continues to constitute a major portion of the U.S. renewables market. As stated by Wood Mackenzie in its latest report, solar constituted 54% of the new electricity-generating capacity additions in the nation in the first quarter of 2023, outweighing all other energy sources.

PNW, which are enhancing their footprint in the U.S. solar market.Alliant Energy is on track to be the fourth largest owner-operator of regulated solar in the United States by 2024. The company plans to add 1.5 GW of solar in 2022-2024. In March 2023, LNT entered into a partnership with Marshalltown YMCA-YWCA to break ground on a 500-kilowatt solar project to be built on donated land in Marshalltown.LNT’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.5%.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its product development activities are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and forex woes persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 123.3% compared with 8% growth of the industry and a 12.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $3.04 billion. The company projects 10.9% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and broke even in the other two, the average surprise being 3.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. Last month, the company announced that Bioscientia had adopted its Revio long-read sequencing system to enhance the latter’s capabilities in genetic testing and research.The same month, PacBio announced a clinical research study with Radboud University Medical Center to explore genetic causes of rare and genetic diseases.Product Development Activities: We are optimistic about PacBio's solid potential in the RNA-sequencing market, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. On its first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, PacBio’s management stated that the demand for its new Revio system continued to be robust, with orders in the first quarter outpacing its shipments of Revio, resulting in a net increase of instrument backlog.In April, PacBio announced the availability of its new high-throughput Nanobind DNA Extraction kits, another key product from its Circulomics acquisition.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: PacBio saw a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong revenues from Instrument and Consumables in the first quarter of 2023. Solid performances in Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa regions were also recorded.DownsidesForex Instability: The majority of PacBio’s revenues, expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. Further, a portion of its operations consists of development and sales activities outside the United States, and therefore the company has foreign exchange exposures relating to non-U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate against all currencies in which PacBio operates, after considering offsetting positions, would have resulted in a significant decrease in the carrying amounts of its net assets.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market where its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.24 to $1.23.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $40.3 million, suggesting a 13.5% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.94bUS$4.39bUS$4.84bUS$5.34bUS$5.72bUS$6.03bUS$6.30bUS$6.54bUS$6.76bUS$6.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x7Est @ 7.00%Est @ 5.53%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.79%Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$149bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$149b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$77bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$116b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$346, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vertex PharmaceuticalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Currently debt free.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for VRTX.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Fortunately, it involved coal cars and not hazardous materials like those that generated a huge plume of black smoke and forced evacuations in the eastern Ohio town of East Palestine after a different Norfolk Southern train derailed in February. That Ohio derailment triggered concerns nationwide about railroad safety and prompted calls for reforms from members of Congress and regulators.A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains, Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)“We’re just lucky right now that it’s coal. If it had been ethanol or LP gas or chlorine or anything like that, it could have been a totally different situation,"" said Randy Fannon, who leads the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union's safety task force.Nineteen cars on the Virginia coal train derailed around 7:45 p.m. Thursday but remained upright and none of the coal spilled.Before the derailment, the crew received a critical alarm from a trackside detector that a wheel bearing was overheating. But unlike in the East Palestine derailment where the crew received little warning, the crew was able to safely stop the Virginia train after it was alerted to the potential hazard.The train's conductor found the railcar that triggered the alarm and confirmed the bearing was overheating. But a spokesman for the railroad said all the components appeared to be intact during a visual inspection.Federal Railroad Administration spokesman Warren Flateau said the railroad decided to try and move the train to a siding, where the crew could safely set out the car with the overheating bearing without blocking the main track. But the train derailed before it reached the siding.National Transportation Safety Board officials said late Friday they would investigate the Virginia derailment. While union officials and the railroads involved in an NTSB investigation aren’t allowed to speak publicly before that agency releases its findings, Fannon discussed the details of the crash Friday afternoon when the FRA was still leading the investigation. The NTSB had not taken the lead at that time.Story continuesFannon said someone at the railroad’s headquarters in Atlanta who was working on the “hot box detector desk” told the crew to go ahead and move the train 8 miles (12.87 kilometers) down the track. The crew told union officials that they weren't comfortable with moving the train at the track speed of roughly 40 mph, so they kept the speed to around 20 mph. But the train still derailed.Spokesman Tom Crosson said Norfolk Southern will use this derailment to help inform changes it is making to improve safety.“This derailment should never have happened. It is unacceptable,” Crosson said. ""We are working to achieve our goal of being the gold standard for safety in the railroad industry, and this incident strengthens our resolve.""A Norfolk Southern locomotive pulls its cargo through a downtown area in Hickory, NC. (Getty Images) (J. Michael Jones via Getty Images)Both the FRA and the NTSB said they were investigating Norfolk Southern's safety practices following the East Palestine derailment and several others in the past couple years.The NTSB is doing a detailed investigation to determine everything that contributed to the East Palestine derailment, but investigators said in their preliminary report that an overheating bearing on a rail car carrying plastic pellets likely caused the derailment. The resulting fire burned for days as several cars carrying hazardous materials spilled their contents. Then officials decided to blow open five vinyl chloride cars and burn that chemical because they were worried those tank cars might explode.“NS is still in the spotlight and they’re going to remain that way until they make some changes,"" Fannon said.In years past before Norfolk Southern began overhauling its operations in 2019 and making widespread job cuts, Fannon said the railroad typically would have sent a mechanical inspector to examine the car after an overheating bearing was found to determine if it was safe to move the train. That doesn't happen anymore after all the cuts to the ranks of inspectors.“I think the key to this is no qualified mechanical person inspected it,” Fannon said.Norfolk Southern, like all the major freight railroads, has streamlined its operations over the past several years to reduce costs by relying more on running fewer, longer trains so it doesn't need as many crews or locomotives. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the other rail unions have said the changes make railroads riskier, spreading employees thin and making it difficult to take the time to properly inspect cars or complete needed preventative maintenance.The railroads have defended their safety record.Railroad officials have said they don't believe the cuts jeopardized safety, and they emphasize that they continue to meet the minimum federal standards. Norfolk Southern's CEO Alan Shaw has said he believes NS is a safe railroad and that he is committed to improving that.]"

All three presently carry a favorable Zacks Rank and are low-beta, with the latter helping to tame volatility. Let’s take a closer look at each for those seeking a more defensive approach.Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. The company has also invested in healthier alternatives such as coffee, sparkling water, and sports drinks.KO’s 43% trailing twelve-month return on equity is certainly worth highlighting, indicating that the company has efficiently generated profits from existing assets relative to other peers in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company is a member of the elite Dividend Kings club, reflecting an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased payouts. Shares currently yield a solid 3% annually with a payout ratio sitting at 73% of earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLamb WestonLamb Weston, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a leading global manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of value-added frozen potato products. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions for some time, with the trend particularly noteworthy for its current fiscal year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLamb Weston has been a big-time earnings performer, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of nearly 50% across its last four quarters. The company delivered a sizable 45% EPS beat in its latest print and reported sales 6% above expectations.Story continuesThe company’s sales growth has been strong as of late, further displayed in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKeep an eye out for LW’s next quarterly release expected on July 25th; the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.06 suggests a 60% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. The quarterly estimate has been revised marginally higher over the last several months.CloroxClorox, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), markets some of the most trusted and recognized brands, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products. Similar to LW, the revisions trend has been notable for Clorox’s current fiscal year, with the quarterly EPS estimate up 2% just over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company sports an inspiring growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar 11% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 25% in FY24. Revenue growth is also apparent, forecasted to see growth of 2% in FY23 and 3% in FY24.It’s worth noting that value-conscious investors may not find CLX shares as attractive, further reflected by the Style Score of “F” for Value. Shares currently trade at a 35.1X forward earnings multiple, well above the five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineStocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies’ products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.And all three companies above – Lamb Weston LW, The Coca-Cola Company KO, and Clorox CLX – could be great considerations for those seeking a more defensive approach.

221,3d70d1fa-67f3-396c-a0df-39fab8a260cc,KO,2023-07-08,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-attracting-investor-130013395.html,1688734813,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.02 billion and $47.36 billion estimates indicate +4.7% and +5.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Mohawk Industries (MHK) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 1.9% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this flooring maker well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MHK meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 1.4% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MHK is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.3. This indicates that the stock moves 30% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that MHK has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MHK earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MHK is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MHK is currently trading at 0.55 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 55 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MHK appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MHK, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

The partnership aims to tackle the challenges of climate change by focusing on decarbonizing industries with high greenhouse gas emissions, such as steel, aluminum and cement.Fluor will contribute its proprietary Econamine FG Plus carbon-capture technology, along with its extensive expertise in engineering, procurement and construction. Meanwhile, Carbfix will bring its groundbreaking technology, which involves dissolving CO2 in water and injecting it into porous basaltic rock formations. This natural process allows CO2 to transform into stable carbonate minerals within two years.The collaboration between Fluor and Carbfix will enable them to offer comprehensive CO2 reduction solutions to clients seeking end-to-end carbon capture and storage. Additionally, the MOU opens opportunities for the companies to explore other CO2 removal projects, including direct air capture and bioenergy carbon capture and storage.Carbfix, having employed its CO2-to-stone method in Iceland for more than a decade, is already capturing and mineralizing a significant portion of CO2 emissions from the country's largest geothermal power plant. It intends to increase this rate to an impressive 95% by 2025.Fluor's partnership with Carbfix represents a strategic move that harnesses the strengths of both companies to address the urgent need for CO2 reduction in challenging industries. With Fluor's advanced technology and engineering capabilities complemented by Carbfix's innovative mineralization process, the collaboration holds promise for advancing sustainable solutions and making substantial progress in the fight against climate change.Focus on Decarbonization EffortsFluor’s market diversity remains a key strength that helps it mitigate the cyclicality of the markets in which it operates. The company intends to drive growth across diverse portfolios by enhancing markets outside the traditional oil and gas sector, including energy transition, advanced technology and life sciences, high-demand metals, infrastructure and mission solutions. The long-term prospects of FLR also remain strong, with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emission compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants.The Energy Solutions segment mainly offers services to energy transition markets, including asset decarbonization, carbon capture, renewable fuels and other low-carbon energy sources.

226,d7ae3f24-d1ab-34b7-8185-cfe4844317ad,GE,2023-07-08,Investors in General Electric (NYSE:GE) have seen solid returns of 162% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-general-electric-nyse-ge-120239422.html,1688817759,STORY,['GE'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) share price is 102% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 16% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 7.3% in 90 days).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for General Electric While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that General Electric has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for General Electric the TSR over the last 3 years was 162%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that General Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 120% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 6% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - General Electric has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The FAA said after the plane landed the flight crew activated the engine fire extinguishers as a precaution.United said it is investigating but declined further comment. Boeing referred questions to the NTSB and United.The plane was delivered in 2020 and the LEAP-1B engine was built by French-American jet engine maker CFM International, which is co-owned by General Electric and France's Safran . CFM said it ""is supporting the NTSB’s investigation."" (Reporting by Kanishka Singh and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham, Leslie Adler anda Kim Coghill)]"

The treatment, a twice-monthly infusion for early-stage Alzheimer's, previously received unanimous support from an external advisory committee to the FDA.It is the second attempt for Eisai and Biogen, which suffered a disastrous rollout — and subsequent rollback— of Leqembi's predecessor, Aduhelm.And while there appears to be more optimism around Leqembi, the road ahead is riddled with speed bumps. Wall Street's reaction Friday suggested as much.Shares of both Biogen and Eisai took hits Friday, with Biogen stock down more than 2% amid a broad market rally. Shares of Eisai trading in Japan fell more than 4% on Friday.Analysts at SVB Securities, however, expressed more relative optimism around the news, writing in a note on Friday, ""We don’t believe these label updates will impact the uptake of Leqembi. ... We continue to expect a slow ramp in 2023 and acceleration moving into 2024.""Burdensome caveatsLeqembi initially received conditional approval in January, which kept Medicare users from accessing the treatment unless they were willing to pay out of pocket and stymied Eisai and Biogen's commercial prospects. Pressure began to recede once the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agreed to cover the treatment.And with CMS now also agreeing to cover the treatment, the companies could see benefits from the approval in the second half of 2023. But this approval comes with some burdensome caveats.Dr. Seth Gale points out evidence of Alzheimer’s disease on PET scans at Brigham And Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., March 30, 2023. REUTERS/Brian Snyder (Brian Snyder / reuters)Those caveats include close monitoring of patients and collection of data for adverse events. A registry has been set up to follow patients and gain greater insight into the prevalence of serious side effects.Story continuesIn clinical trials conducted by Eisai and Biogen, 17% of participants on Leqembi experienced brain bleeding, and it remains to be seen how much that and brain swelling is seen in the real world.In addition, the FDA included a testing requirement to identify those higher at risk for serious side effects and discuss these risks with patients.Several headwindsLeqembi is also the second attempt by the duo to target plaque buildup in the brain — known as amyloid beta — and faces several headwinds in addition to the requirements from the US government.In addition to the burden on clinicians and patients, the high costs could add up. Commercial payors have stayed silent on how they will plan to cover the treatment — and if prior authorization will be required. And Medicare's coverage still requires 20% coinsurance after a patient's deductible is met.A recent estimate put the burden on Medicare at between $2 billion and $5 billion annually, based on the $26,500 per year price tag for Leqembi. That could increase Medicare beneficiary premiums, according to research from JAMA.High costs could also become a political challenge for the company, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among those who have been pushing back on the price of the new Alzheimer's drugs, saying they could bankrupt Medicare.""According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, if only 10% of the 6.7 million older adults with Alzheimer’s disease take Leqembi at Eisai and Biogen’s proposed price, it would cost Medicare $17.8 billion, which is nearly half of what Medicare Part B spent on all drugs in 2021,"" Sanders said last month prior to the treatment's approval.Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) holds a press conference on Capitol Hill on March 7, 2023. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)And that's before it faces competition from Eli Lilly's (LLY) donanemab, which reported positive Phase 3 data in May and is expected to receive approval.Analysts at JPMorgan noted Friday that the uptick in costs from these new drugs may not have been factored into Medicare Advantage plan pricing.""It is possible Leqembi approval (and the potential traditional approval of Donanemab) could drive some incremental costs in 2H23 but the bigger question is likely around potential 2024 impact. MA plans have some cushion in their bids for unexpected trend increases, but it is unclear how potential Leqembi/Donanemab costs factor in vs. expectations,"" the analysts said.Among Medicare Advantage plan sponsors Humana (HUM) could see the highest impacts with Cigna (CI) likely facing more muted challenges.Another headwind for the treatment will be limited patient access. While Medicare coverage helps provide the treatment to millions more patients, the burden of a twice-weekly infusion could hamper patient uptake in the near term.The aforementioned challenges with Aduhelm are also likely to weigh on Leqembi as the duo overcome skepticism in the clinical community about the seriousness of the side effects.Still, Wall Street sees some upside.BMO Research analysts noted that while the approval was expected, ""investor attention now turns to building out the market for patient access.""JPMorgan noted that UnitedHealth (UNH) and CVS (CVS) are likely to see the most upside from the approvals, as they both operate home infusion businesses, which could offset the pressures on their Medicare Advantage costs, the analysts said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
230,73573027-e170-35fa-b540-cfee2f00e480,UNH,2023-07-08,UnitedHealth Group (UNH) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-unh-earnings-expected-140006553.html,1688738406,STORY,['UNH'],"[The market expects UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.4%.Revenues are expected to be $90.59 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.39% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth?For UnitedHealth, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.76%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UnitedHealth will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of $6.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.26, delivering a surprise of +0.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.UnitedHealth doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; GambleOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Jon Moeller, for US$4.5m worth of shares, at about US$149 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$152, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 10% of Jon Moeller's holding.In the last year Procter &amp; Gamble insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Procter &amp; Gamble Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Procter &amp; Gamble. In total, insiders dumped US$4.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Procter &amp; Gamble Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.05% of the company, currently worth about US$187m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; Gamble Tell Us?Insiders sold Procter &amp; Gamble shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.Principal Financial Group (PFG) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PFG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.71. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.12. Over the last 12 months, PFG's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.67 and as low as 8.62, with a median of 11.07.Another notable valuation metric for PFG is its P/B ratio of 1.79. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.74. PFG's P/B has been as high as 2.45 and as low as 1.39, with a median of 1.79, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PFG has a P/S ratio of 1.06. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.57.Story continuesThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Principal Financial Group is likely being undervalued right now.

UHS is aided by improved patient volumes, an expanding healthcare portfolio and a commendable financial position. A favorable business outlook for 2023 reinforces investors’ confidence in the stock.Top Zacks Rank &amp; Upbeat Price PerformanceUniversal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The stock has soared 46.9% in a year, compared with the industry’s 56.7% growth. The Zacks Medical sector has declined 9.7% but the S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 12.9% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreUHS carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps find stocks that are undervalued. Back-tested results have shown that stocks with a favorable Value Score in combination with a solid Zacks Rank, are the best investment bets.Robust ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.27 per share, indicating growth of 4% from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $14.1 billion, implying a rise of 5.4% from the year-ago reported number.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $11.62 per share, suggesting an improvement of 13.1% from the 2023 estimate. The same for revenues stands at $14.7 billion, hinting at a 3.9% increase from the 2023 estimate.Impressive Earnings Surprise HistoryUniversal Health’s bottom line outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.62%.Valuation: Cheaply PricedPrice-to-earnings (P/E) is one of the multiples used for valuing healthcare stocks.  UHS has a reading of 13.86, compared with the hospital industry’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 15.66. It is quite evident that the stock is currently undervalued.A Strong View for 2023UHS forecasts revenues to lie between $14,044 million and $14,314 million in 2023, the midpoint of which indicates roughly a 4.8-6.8% increase from the 2022 level.Adjusted earnings per share are projected between $9.50 and $10.50 this year, the midpoint of which suggests 1.2% growth from the 2022 figure.Story continuesKey DriversThe top line of Universal Health continues to benefit on the back of a growing patient base and solid contributions from the Acute Care Hospital Services and Behavioral Health Care Services segments. An official of UnitedHealth Group UNH signaled toward the resumption of pent-up elective procedures at the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference held in June 2023.This brings a ray of hope for healthcare facility operators like UHS whose revenues suffered due to a temporary pause exerted on elective surgeries in order to treat the escalating number of COVID cases.An increase in the number of elective surgeries will bring about improved inpatient occupancy levels and boost revenues of Universal Health as its treatment network comprised 358 inpatient facilities across 39 states, Washington, D.C., the U.K. and Puerto Rico as of Mar 31, 2023.Out of the total 358 inpatient facilities, 185 are behavioral healthcare facilities spread across the United States, thereby providing Universal Health with ample scope to capitalize on the solid demand for behavioral healthcare services resulting from the growing incidence of mental health issues among Americans.UHS pursues service launches, upgradation of existing services and acquisitions of healthcare facilities to boost its capabilities, thereby paving the way for higher profitability of owned hospitals. It also resorts to such efforts as a means to delve into newer markets and solidify its presence across existing ones.To pursue uninterrupted growth-related initiatives, a solid financial position is a dire need. The same is the case with Universal Health which contains solid cash reserves and adequate cash-generation abilities. Apart from business investments, a strong financial stand also enables UHS to engage in the prudent deployment of capital via share buybacks and dividend payments.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the Medical space are Alkermes ALKS and Ligand Pharmaceuticals LGND, each currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

237,15b6ca07-9e09-3ec8-8384-f30cb295be1c,FCX,2023-07-08,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-trending-130007128.html,1688734807,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this mining company have returned +0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has lost 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -21.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -25.4%. This estimate has changed -8.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.16 indicates a change of +18.5% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.88 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.6%. The $23.79 billion and $24.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.4% and +1.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DUK recently unveiled Kentucky's largest rooftop solar facility with a generation capacity of up to 2 megawatts (MWs). It operates on the top of the 800,000-square-foot Amazon Air Hub.  The solar project, built as part of a joint partnership between Amazon and Duke Energy, should bolster both companies’ clean energy goals.With the entire utility sector rapidly adopting renewables as their preferred energy source, the latest revelation is likely to lead more customers to choose DUK as their electricity provider, boosting its future revenues.DUK’s Transition to Renewable EnergyLike other utilities, Duke Energy boasts a prudent strategy to enhance its clean energy portfolio. The company plans to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050. Notably, DUK’s capital expenditure plan includes investments worth $40 billion for zero-carbon generation, such as solar, wind and battery storage resources, and extending the life of its nuclear fleet over the next decade.  It also plans to bring 3,100 MW of new solar in service by 2028.To promote renewable energy further, the company is targeting the energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% of the total generation by 2030 and exit coal fully by 2035 as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. Such initiatives, including the unveiling of the latest solar plant in Kentucky, will enable DUK to duly meet its target in 2050.Growth ProspectsSolar Energy continues to constitute a major portion of the U.S. renewables market. As stated by Wood Mackenzie in its latest report, solar constituted 54% of the new electricity-generating capacity additions in the nation in the first quarter of 2023, outweighing all other energy sources. Per the Solar Energy Industries Association report, the solar market is projected to triple in size over the next five years.This should benefit Duke Energy and other prominent utility players like Alliant Energy Corp. LNT, PPL Corp. PPL and Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW, which are enhancing their footprint in the U.S. solar market.Alliant Energy is on track to be the fourth largest owner-operator of regulated solar in the United States by 2024. The company plans to add 1.5 GW of solar in 2022-2024. In March 2023, LNT entered into a partnership with Marshalltown YMCA-YWCA to break ground on a 500-kilowatt solar project to be built on donated land in Marshalltown.LNT’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 8% over 2022’s reported figure.In December 2022, PPL Corp.’s subsidiary Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company filed with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve adding nearly 1,000 MWs of solar generation and 125 MWs of battery storage.PPL’s long-term earnings growth rate is 7.4%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.14%.Pinnacle West Capital is expecting to invest $1.34 billion in clean power generation during 2023-2025. At the end of 2022, its principal subsidiary, Arizona Public Service, had a diverse portfolio of 2,418 MW in operation and 1,476 MW under development, including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas.PNW’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 2.1% over 2022’s reported figure.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of DUK have lost 1.6 % against the industry’s 0.6% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The FC5 variety has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips.In a statement, Kuruganti said ""It is good that the judgement of Justice Navin Chawla upheld the revocation order.""In 2019, PepsiCo sued some Indian farmers for cultivating the FC5 potato variety, accusing growers of infringing its patent. The company also sought more than 10 million rupees ($121,050) each for alleged patent infringement.Within months, PepsiCo withdrew lawsuits against farmers.In its order, the Delhi High Court did not uphold accusations of any public interest violation by PepsiCo.PepsiCo is the second large U.S. company to face patent infringement issues in India.Story continuesAfter a long-standing intellectual property dispute, seed maker Monsanto, now owned by German drugmaker Bayer AG, withdrew from some businesses in India.($1 = 82.61 rupees)(Reporting by Mayank Bhardwaj and Sumit Khanna; Editing by Kim Coghill)]"

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsThe Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$692). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 26% of Arthur Ryan's stake. Arthur Ryan was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&amp;P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.Also read: 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to BuySince the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.Story continuesTony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The demand is really real. You can contrast what is going on in AI versus [enthusiasm for] the metaverse or virtual reality a year or two ago. The orders are really there. The earnings growth is coming.”Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns.
