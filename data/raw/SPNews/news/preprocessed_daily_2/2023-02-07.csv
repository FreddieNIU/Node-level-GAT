Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President, Leon Topalian, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.2m worth of shares at a price of US$112 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$170. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 13% of Leon Topalian's holding.In the last year Nucor insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Nucor Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Nucor. In total, insiders dumped US$2.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of NucorMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Nucor insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$286m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Nucor Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Nucor shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Nucor is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Nucor (1 shouldn't be ignored) you should be aware of.Of course Nucor may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

3,fc3b4570-6f3f-3b7d-861c-c6fa2f1eb507,NUE,2023-02-07,Nucor (NUE) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-nue-great-momentum-stock-170005723.html,1675702805,STORY,['NUE'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Nucor (NUE), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nucor currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if NUE is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this steel company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor NUE, shares are up 5.85% over the past week while the Zacks Steel - Producers industry is down 0.12% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.72% compares favorably with the industry's 11.46% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Nucor have increased 27.29% over the past quarter, and have gained 58.75% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 11.68% and -6.21%, respectively.Investors should also take note of NUE's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NUE is averaging 1,956,369 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with NUE.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NUE's consensus estimate, increasing from $11.74 to $12.98 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NUE is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nucor on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,e284bf56-14cb-31c1-ae19-95dd18c00fd0,NUE,2023-02-07,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steel-dynamics-inc-stld-hits-141502269.html,1675692902,STORY,"['STLD', 'NUE']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Steel Dynamics (STLD)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 24.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $132.5 in the previous session. Steel Dynamics has gained 31.2% since the start of the year compared to the 9% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 23.4% return for the Zacks Steel - Producers industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 25, 2023, Steel Dynamics reported EPS of $4.37 versus consensus estimate of $3.6 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.99%.For the current fiscal year, Steel Dynamics is expected to post earnings of $11.61 per share on $17.83 billion in revenues. This represents a -48.81% change in EPS on a -19.92% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.83 per share on $15.9 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -23.94% and -10.84%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSteel Dynamics may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Steel Dynamics has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 11.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 4.9X versus its peer group's average of 2.3X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Steel Dynamics currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Steel Dynamics meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Steel Dynamics shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does STLD Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of STLD have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Nucor Corporation (NUE). NUE has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. Nucor Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 16.99%, and for the current fiscal year, NUE is expected to post earnings of $12.98 per share on revenue of $30.95 billion.Shares of Nucor Corporation have gained 22.7% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 13.61X and a P/CF of 5.23X.The Steel - Producers industry is in the top 9% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for STLD and NUE, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusBased in Pasadena, Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 15.19%. The life science real estate company is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.88% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.38% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.58%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.84 is up 2.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.07%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 57%, meaning it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ARE expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.94 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 6.18%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, ARE presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Our survey found 86% of investors have discussed market volatility with their financial advisor and 83% say their advisor has informed them of how volatility will affect their long-term financial goals.""It seems investors are getting the message about sticking to their long-term investment strategy. The survey found even with volatility in the market, 57% of US investors plan to keep their money ‘as is’ and stick to their long-term strategy.Story continuesFurthermore, 17% plan to leave their money as is, but opportunistically invest more if market conditions permit, while 18% indicate they will move money to other investments to reduce the risk of loss. A mere 8% plan to retreat to cash to avoid potential loss.Top Financial Concerns Among US InvestorsThe survey found 71% of US investors are ""optimistic"" or ""very optimistic"" about their own financial future over the next 12 months. While this number may seem high, it is significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels when it was 88% toward the end of 2019, at the close of a decade-long bull market.Today, nearly three-quarters (74%) of investors are worried about inflation. Although inflation concerns have waned slightly since June (76%), they’re still relatively high when compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 71%.Since last June, general concern over market volatility has declined 11 percentage points to 46%. Still, the percentage of those concerned about the value of their actual investments eroding has held steady since June, when it was at 59% compared to 56% today.Taking a look at concerns over long-term saving goals like retirement reveal a slightly different story. Worry over retirement is seeing an uptick, with 52% indicating concern about saving enough for retirement versus 45% in June. Similarly, 50% fear running out of money in retirement versus 46% in June.ETF Investor PerceptionJanuary 2023 marked the 30th anniversary of the first ever US-listed exchange traded fund (ETF), the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Launched on January 22, 1993, SPY is the world’s largest ETF with more than $355 billion in assets and the most heavily traded security in the world with an average daily trading volume of $39 billion.Overall, perception of the benefits ETFs have brought to investors has been overwhelmingly positive. The survey found that 59% of US investors with an existing ETF holding report that ETFs have improved the overall performance of their portfolio. Furthermore, more than half (53%) of US investors believe ETFs have made them a better investor.""Advisor adoption of ETFs has provided investors with cost-effective access to institutional-grade solutions,"" said Williams. ""The flexibility to buy and sell shares quickly, easily, and cost-efficiently is important to advisors and their clients in all markets.""In 2022, 65% of advisors recommend using ETFs in their portfolios, and 41% of advisors are looking to increase their usage of ETFs in the next twelve months. †""Investors continue to turn to ETFs for their inherent liquidity benefits,"" said Colin Ireland, head of ETF Execution Strategy at State Street Global Advisors ""These benefits often become most pronounced in times of volatility – when investors need it most. Among SPY’s many milestones: in 2020 it became the first ETF to trade more than $100 billion in a single session amidst the COVID-19 induced volatility.""ETF use cases in the advisory market have expanded significantly in the three decades since SPY’s launch, and continue to evolve beyond just asset allocation and diversification planning. A number of wealth management firms use ETFs to package their investment beliefs into outcome-oriented products for their clients. ETFs have also been used to create model portfolios that give advisors the ability to outsource the investment component so that they can focus more attention on client outcomes.Additional ResourcesFor more on State Street Global Advisors’ point of view on how advisors can help clients remain confident during uncertain times, read Market Volatility: A Relationship-Building Opportunity for Financial Advisors.Appreciating the True Value of Advice offers insights for individual investors on how to find the right financial advisor.† ""2022 Trends in Investing Survey,"" Journal of Financial Planning and FPA, Accessed December 13, 2022About State Street Global Advisors ETF Impact Survey, November - December 2022State Street Global Advisors, in partnership with A2Bplanning and Prodege, conducted an online survey among individual investors in the US, EMEA (UK, Switzerland, Netherlands, Israel) and APAC (Singapore, Japan, Australia).

However, higher general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs hurt results to some extent.Gross Profits Improve, G&amp;A Expenses RiseGross profits (before credit costs for trust accounts) for the nine-month period were ¥ 3,579.8 billion ($26.3 billion), up 21.3% from the prior-year period. The upsurge was mainly driven by higher NII.Results reflect a 55.1% year-over-year increase in NII, which was ¥2,313.7 billion ($17 billion). Trust fees, along with net fees and commissions, totaled ¥1,248 billion ($9.2 billion), up 10.4%.

A new study designed and conducted by Concentrix found that the program is doing exactly that, giving students more confidence and knowledge of their finances.Students participating in the U.S. Bank scholarship program complete a series of free, online modules covering topics ranging from building credit scores to building emergency savings, and then are entered into a sweepstakes to win up to $14,000 in scholarship funds. The decade-old program has continued to grow in participation each year, with $45,000 in scholarships awarded annually.""The results of this study validate the benefits of financial education in helping students become financially confident and knowledgeable,"" said Kaori Yamada, senior vice president of financial education for U.S. Bank. ""We share these learnings with others and invite them to extend access to financial education.""Here are the key learnings from the study commissioned by U.S. Bank, which evaluated students before and after completing the online modules:Incentives and scholarships entice students to engage with financial education.The financial incentive attached to the scholarship program has proved attractive to students, with almost two in three participants citing it as the main reason they decided to register for the program. The potential to win scholarship money motivated students to enroll in the online modules, exposing them to financial lessons and planning tools they otherwise may have not sought out.Financial confidence and knowledge increase significantly with even a small amount of financial education training.Less than 10% of respondents said they were confident or knowledgeable about finances before completing any learning modules. This number increased to more than 40% after students completed financial education modules.The scholarship program is effective in driving financial wellness in addition to improving financial knowledge.After completing a module, students were asked how likely they were to take action to better their financial wellness. Ninety-seven percent of participants said they were likely or very likely to take action based on the information they learned. After participating in the program, more participants said they currently, or plan to, engage in financially healthy behaviors such as having a savings account, building emergency savings, following a budget or building their credit score.Students of color who engaged in the program experienced a bigger confidence boost than white students.After completing the lessons, almost half of students of color reported feeling confident about managing their finances - a 350% increase over students of color who had not yet completed any of the modules. Financial confidence among students of color exceeded the financial confidence level white students indicated after completing the lessons.Story continuesBased on these findings, U.S. Bank is making plans in 2023 to shift its scholarship program to utilize more gamified content that offers shorter, more digestible lessons. In addition, a larger variety of topics will be available.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walmart (WMT).Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Walmart, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in WMT?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.4% over the past month to $6.08.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust reported a surprise of 1.10% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected healthy demand during the primary leasing season.Over the trailing four quarters, Equity Residential surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average surprise being 1.14%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Equity Residential Price and EPS SurpriseEquity Residential Price and EPS SurpriseEquity Residential price-eps-surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for EQR before this announcement.Key FactorsFor the U.S. apartment market, low consumer confidence and high inflation have taken a toll, with net demand for apartments ending in negative territory for calendar 2022, per a report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage. Despite solid job growth and wage gains, there was weak demand for all types of housing.Amid this soft demand, new-lease apartment rents fell in December for the fourth consecutive month, declining another 0.4%. The cumulative rent drop was around 1.6% since September. Also, the national apartment vacancy surged from a record seasonal low of 2.5% one year ago to 5.0% in December 2022.Despite this softness in demand, Equity Residential’s quarterly performance is likely to have been supported by its portfolio diversification efforts in the urban and suburban markets. It has a healthy balance sheet and banks on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth. EQR’s target resident is more affluent, with lower unemployment and favorable prospects ahead.Per its November Investor Update presentation, rents peaked in early August 2022 and have moderated since then. The percentage of residents renewing remains healthy and consistent with historical levels after normalization from record-high levels after the pandemic in late 2021 and early 2022.Per its preliminary data as of Oct 20, 2022, physical occupancy was 96.2% in October, while the new lease change was 5.3%. From the beginning of 2022 through Oct 20, 2022, the blended rate was 12.5%.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s quarterly revenues stands at $697.06 million, indicating an 8.05% increase year over year. The consensus estimate for same-store revenue growth is pegged at 9.75%. The consensus estimate for physical occupancy is presently pegged at 96.20% for the fourth quarter, down 30 basis points (bps) sequentially and 20 bps year over year.For the fourth quarter of 2022, Equity Residential projected normalized FFO per share in the band of 94-96 cents.Before the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly normalized FFO per share has remained unrevised in the past month at 94 cents. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 14.6%.For the full-year 2022, Equity Residential projected normalized FFO per share in the band of $3.52-$3.54. The company’s full-year guidance incorporates a same-store revenue growth projection of 10.6%, while expenses are expected to increase by 3.3%. Consequently, NOI is estimated to expand 14.25%. Physical occupancy is expected at 96.4%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for normalized FFO per share is pegged at $3.52. The figure indicates a 17.7% increase year over year on 10.9% year-over-year growth in revenues to $2.73 billion.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Equity Residential this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.93%.

(NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.5 billion, and full-year 2022 revenue of $5.5 billion, surpassing prior guidance, with strong commercial and operational execution. While fourth quarter orders were down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 3 percent organically, the Company grew backlog 14 percent organically on resilient underlying demand. On January 23, Xylem announced it had agreed to acquire Evoqua in a $7.5 billion, all-stock transaction, creating a transformative platform to address intensifying water challenges, globally.Fourth quarter earnings exceeded Xylem’s previous guidance. Net income was $149 million, or $0.82 per share. Net income margin increased 140 basis points to 9.9 percent. These results included increased restructuring and realignment costs and higher taxes during the quarter. Adjusted net income was $168 million, or $0.92 per share, which excludes the impacts of restructuring, realignment and special charges. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 18.7 percent, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 250 basis points. Strong price realization offset inflation and, coupled with productivity savings and higher volume, drove the margin expansion, exceeding the impact of strategic investments.For the full year, net income was $355 million, or $1.96 per share. Net income margin decreased 180 basis points to 6.4 percent. These results were mainly driven by a previously announced, one-time non-cash pension plan settlement. Adjusted net income was $516 million, or $2.85 per share, which excludes the impacts of restructuring, realignment and special charges. Full-year adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.0 percent, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 10 basis points. Inflation, strategic investments and the impact of chip shortages in the first half exceeded the benefits of price realization and productivity savings. The Company generated $596 million of operating cash flow, representing a 168 percent conversion, and $388 million of free cash flow, representing an 80 percent conversion of net income excluding the non-cash impairment charges and non-cash pension plan settlement.Story continues""The team drove fourth quarter results well above expectations, with very strong performance across all business segments and regions,"" said Patrick Decker, Xylem president and CEO. ""Resilient demand and strong backlog execution delivered robust double-digit revenue growth with significant margin expansion. That out-performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022 has fueled healthy momentum coming into 2023.""""Our customer focus and operational discipline are building on a foundation of resilient underlying demand for the value of Xylem’s offering in our largest end-markets,"" continued Decker. ""As trends driving water investment continue to intensify, we are confident about delivering full-year 2023 growth in the mid-single digits, with significant margin expansion, tracking solidly toward Xylem’s longer-term growth milestones. Of course, we’re very excited about the transformative agreement we have announced to acquire Evoqua. The combination will be positioned to have greater impact in addressing the world’s water challenges and create even more value for shareholders. Until the transaction closes, however, we remain focused on delivering our commitments to our stakeholders, as we plan for a smooth integration.""Xylem announced that its Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend in the amount of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10 percent. The dividend is payable on March 22, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2023.Full-year 2023 OutlookXylem’s full-year and first quarter 2023 guidance does not reflect the planned acquisition of Evoqua, which was announced on January 23, 2023, and is expected to close mid-year 2023. Additional information about the proposed transaction is available at www.xylem.com/investors.Xylem forecasts full-year 2023 revenue in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 billion, up 3 to 5 percent on a reported basis and up 4 to 6 percent on an organic basis.Full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 17.5 to 18.0 percent, an increase of 50 to 100 basis points. This results in adjusted earnings per share of $3.00 to $3.25, which represents an increase of 5 to 14 percent from Xylem’s 2022 adjusted results. Full-year free cash flow conversion to net income is expected to be 100 percent.Further 2023 planning assumptions are included in Xylem’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings materials posted at www.xylem.com/investors. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.Fourth Quarter Segment ResultsWater InfrastructureXylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.Fourth quarter 2022 revenue was $668 million, a 7 percent increase, 15 percent organically, compared with fourth quarter 2021. This strong growth was driven by price realization, robust utilities and industrials demand in the US and Western Europe, and dewatering demand in Emerging Markets.Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $132 million, an 8 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $4 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $136 million, a 10 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. Reported operating margin for the segment was 19.8 percent, up 20 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 20.4 percent, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5 percent, up 80 basis points from the prior year. Favorable price realization net of inflation and higher volume more than offset strategic investments.Applied WaterXylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in industrial, commercial building, and residential applications.Fourth quarter 2022 revenue was $455 million, a 12 percent increase, 17 percent organically, year-over-year. The robust growth was driven by strong price realization across all end-markets and regions.Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $61 million, a 22 percent increase versus comparable period last year, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $9 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $70 million, a 35 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 13.4 percent, up 110 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points over the prior year period to 15.4 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5 percent, up 270 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation, coupled with productivity savings.Measurement &amp; Control SolutionsXylem’s Measurement &amp; Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics, and analytic instrumentation.Fourth quarter 2022 revenue was $383 million, up 30 percent, 35 percent organically, versus the prior year. The robust growth is driven by improved chip supply compared to prior year, as well as strength in our water quality test and pipeline assessment applications.Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $19 million, compared to $17 million loss in the comparable period last year, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs and $1 million of special charges, was $23 million, compared to $15 million loss in comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 5.0 percent, up 1080 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin of 6.0 percent increased 1110 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.1 percent, up 800 basis points from the prior year. Strong price realization offset inflation and, coupled with productivity savings and higher volume, drove the margin expansion, exceeding the impact of strategic investments.Supplemental information on Xylem’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings and reconciliations for certain non-GAAP items is posted at www.xylem.com/investors.About XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving critical water and infrastructure challenges with innovation.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 731.8%.Q4 EstimatesFor the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss per share has narrowed to $1.60 from $1.63 in the past seven days. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported adjusted earnings per share of 12 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.35 billion, suggesting growth of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3.06 billion.Factors to NoteThe company’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from improvement in domestic operations, robust sports betting and pent-up demand. The company has also been benefiting from high domestic casino spending.Recently, the company said that BetMGM ended fiscal 2022 on a strong note, establishing itself as the top player in this business in North America. The expected net revenues from operations of BetMGM in fiscal 2022 are $1.44 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Las Vegas Strip and Regional operations’ revenues are pegged at $2,094 million and $917 million, suggesting year-over-year improvement of 15.9% and 1.9%, respectively. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in MGM China segment is pegged at $141 million compared with $315 million reported in the prior-year quarter.However, high cost is likely to have negatively impacted the company’s profit in the quarter-to-be reported.

This takes the annual payment to 1.7% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Microchip Technology's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, Microchip Technology was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 25.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMicrochip Technology Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.70 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.43. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 7.4% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Microchip Technology has impressed us by growing EPS at 48% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.We Really Like Microchip Technology's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial HIG and Old Republic International ORI. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With seven hikes in interest rate in 2022, already one this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products as well as exposure to intangible assets offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by the analysts for the current year.    Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months.

We provide these measures to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. Investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined in the same manner by other companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Also, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as alternatives, or superior, to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release are defined below.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for: (i) interest expense, net; (ii) tax provision (benefit); (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) other (income) expense, net; (v) stock-based compensation expense; (vi) depreciation, amortization, and accretion; (vii) loss on impairment of lease related assets, net, as applicable; and (viii) acquisition and integration charges and certain other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP Revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures of our recurring operations as they exclude items not representative of our core operating results.Adjusted Net Income: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) loss on impairment of lease related assets, net as applicable; (v) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, as applicable; and (vi) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Adjusted EPS: Represents GAAP diluted EPS adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include on a per share basis: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) loss on impairment of lease related assets, net as applicable; (v) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, as applicable; and (vi) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted EPS is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Free Cash Flow: Represents cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP less payments for capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the Company’s core operations that may be available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Foreign Currency Neutral (FX Neutral): We provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our contract values, revenues, certain expenses, and other metrics. These foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured. We calculate foreign currency neutral dollar amounts by converting the underlying amounts in local currency for different periods into U.S. dollars by applying the same foreign exchange rates to all periods presented.SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONSThe tables below provide reconciliations of certain Non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release with the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

IT may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Gartner is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.58 per share for IT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.52% heading into earnings season.Gartner, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGartner, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGartner, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Gartner, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that IT has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Gartner, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Morgan Stanley in FocusMorgan Stanley (MS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 16.95% since the start of the year. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.77 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.12% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.47% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.58%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.10 is up 5.1% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 27.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Morgan Stanley's payout ratio is 49%, which means it paid out 49% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.21 per share, with earnings expected to increase 13.36% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Maher has named Olga Fleming, currently serving as MMC's Global President, as the CEO of MMC and specialist agency RXMosaic, effective immediately. Maher and Fleming have been collaborating for several months to ensure a smooth succession that prioritizes MMC's people, client excellence and business momentum.Olga Fleming, MMC’s new CEO &amp; Marina Maher, Founder of MMC""This was indeed a big decision, but it wasn't a hard one,"" said Maher. ""We are coming off a strong year with new business growth and a positive outlook for 2023. I have always been passionate about helping women thrive in their careers and succeed in leadership positions. It is one of the pillars upon which I established MMC and I am thrilled to be able to name such an accomplished, inspirational and inclusive leader from within the agency,"" remarked Maher.""Over the last 40 years, we built a communications agency that broke the mold in women's communications,"" said Maher. ""We have expanded on this foundation with an audience and culture-first focus that produces wholly differentiated programming. Looking ahead, I believe the time has come for both me and the agency to take the next step.""Maher has assumed the role of non-executive chair of MMC and will serve as a senior counselor on select accounts. She has also been chosen by CEO of ORPG, Chris Foster, to establish and lead OPRG's first-ever Institute for Women's Leadership to develop women business leaders across the OPRG portfolio.""Marina combined her passion for women's causes with her sharp business sense and built an agency that, 40 years later, is still creatively connecting brands to culture and delivering outsized results for clients,"" said Foster.

At a time when the industry was dominated by men, Marina's bold and pioneering approach was nothing short of groundbreaking. Over the decades, the agency has continued to break barriers and push boundaries with campaigns that tackled historically taboo topics such as vaginal health, overactive bladders, and menopause with sensitivity, intelligence, empathy, and impact. MMC also made waves by extending make-up to men and a locker room shampoo to women, challenging societal norms and setting a new standard for inclusivity.MMC: The Next ChapterFleming joined MMC in 2021 as President, Health and Corporate and was promoted to Global President in 2022.

OMC may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Omnicom Group is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for OMC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.99 per share for OMC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for OMC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.75% heading into earnings season.Omnicom Group Inc.

Va., Feb. 6, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The FirstEnergy Foundation is granting $25,000 to the Central Appalachian Region of the American Red Cross to continue its important work in the Mon Power service area supporting the health and wellness of diverse community members through the American Red Cross Sickle Cell Initiative.FirstEnergy Foundation Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The grant will help the Red Cross aid people with sickle cell disease, the most common genetic blood disease in the U.S., which affects about 100,000 people, primarily of African descent. As a group, people with sickle cell disease experience worse health outcomes compared to patients with other diseases and have access to fewer health resources. The American Red Cross Sickle Cell Initiative will improve their quality of life by working to address health outcome disparities in African American communities.""We're proud to help the American Red Cross serve those without access to the treatment they need. The organization's efforts align with our company's commitment to strengthening low-income and underserved communities,"" said Lorna Wisham, president of the FirstEnergy Foundation.Beyond the few medications available to treat sickle cell disease, regular blood transfusions can be crucial to alleviating its painful and life-threatening symptoms. The closely matched blood needed by patients with sickle cell disease — which is most commonly supplied by blood donors who are Black or African American — is often in short supply. In fact, the Red Cross is currently only able to provide the most compatible units of blood for people with sickle cell disease about 50% of the time. While the percentage of the U.S. population that identifies as Black or African American is 13.4%, the percentage of blood donors who identify as Black or African American is less than 3% — a gap that demands immediate attention.""We are grateful for the generous grant that will help us address this health disparity,"" said Erica Mani, Red Cross Regional CEO. ""The Red Cross's goal is to triple the number of blood donors who are Black or African American by the end of 2025, as they have the greatest potential to supply a compatible blood unit for transfusion for people living with sickle cell disease.""Story continuesThe FirstEnergy Foundation is funded solely by FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) and provides support to non-profit, tax-exempt health and human services agencies; educational organizations; cultural and arts programs and institutions; and civic groups in areas served by FirstEnergy's 10 electric distribution companies and in areas where the company conducts business.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

52,f4265cd4-4735-3f04-aad9-ef1b578bd011,FE,2023-02-07,FirstEnergy (FE) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-fe-earnings-expected-grow-150003693.html,1675695603,STORY,['FE'],"[FirstEnergy (FE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.84 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.81% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FirstEnergy?For FirstEnergy, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FirstEnergy would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering a surprise of +2.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FirstEnergy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Fortis (FTS) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.99 billion, down 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Fortis has been revised 1.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.62%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fortis will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.36, up 61.9% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.99 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com.

""First, many are in the technology sector. Second, many hired aggressively during the pandemic—on average, their headcount grew 41%—often because they over-extrapolated pandemic-related trends such as increases in demand for goods or time spent online. Third, they have seen sharper declines in their stock prices, which have fallen 43% from their peaks on average, and in some cases appear to be responding to investor demand to cut costs by shrinking their workforces rather than to a worsening in the demand outlook.""The logo of Meta Platforms is seen in Davos, Switzerland, May 22, 2022. Picture taken May 22, 2022. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannTo be sure, the layoff announcements have come in hot and heavy in recent months.To kick off February, Dell (DELL) announced Monday it would cut about 5% of its workforce — or 6,000 workers — amid a slump in PC sales. This round of layoffs will put Dell's headcount at its lowest level in six years following previous hiring freezes and cost-cutting measures, according to Bloomberg.PayPal (PYPL) also announced last week it will be canning 7% of its workforce (around 2,000 people) as it stays focused on cost-cutting efforts after feeling pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.In January, Salesforce (CRM) said it would slash 10% of its workforce and execute select real estate exits and office space reductions. Microsoft (MSFT) followed that news with 10,000 layoffs of its own. And Amazon (AMZN) then revealed 18,000 layoffs.And in 2022, Meta (META) unveiled 10,000 layoffs in November while Snap (SNAP) laid off 20% of its workforce in August.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Economic bears continue to voice the concern that the layoffs are a sign of a sharply slowing U.S. economy, though Hatzius thinks that view is an overreach.Story continuesFor one thing, the U.S. economy created an impressive 517,000 jobs in January, and job gains for November and December 2022 were also revised higher.""These characteristics suggest that the companies conducting layoffs are not representative of the broader economy and that many of the recent layoff announcements do not necessarily signal a weaker demand picture that might have wider implications,"" Hatzius said. ""It is also important to bear in mind that not every layoff translates into a lasting increase in unemployment because most workers find new jobs. In recent months, the job finding rate among unemployed individuals has been high by historical standards.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Salesforce.com currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.45%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects.

ACCO and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.5 Promising Price-to-Book-Value Stocks to Buy in FebruaryIt’s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than what they're worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is necessary to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.For narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization / book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Signet Jewelers, Phillips 66, Acco Brands Corp. and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Story continuesUnderstanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB, Signet Jewelers SIG, Phillips 66 PSX, Acco Brands Corporation ACCO and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.  Check out our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance  Walgreens Boots Alliance Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Nancy Schlichting, for US$661k worth of shares, at about US$39.89 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$37.09. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Nancy Schlichting.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Walgreens Boots Alliance better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Walgreens Boots Alliance Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Walgreens Boots Alliance. In total, Independent Director Nancy Schlichting dumped US$661k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Walgreens Boots Alliance Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Walgreens Boots Alliance insiders own 17% of the company, worth about US$5.42b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Walgreens Boots Alliance Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To that end, you should learn about the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Walgreens Boots Alliance (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  .But note: Walgreens Boots Alliance may not be the best stock to buy .

You have reinforced the importance of dreaming bigger than others may even think is possible. And for that, I will forever be grateful. And so now the floor is yours. Howard.Howard Schultz: Thank you, Tiffany. I did not expect that. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to comment on the strong financial and operating results Starbucks reported today, highlighted by record quarterly sales of $8.7 billion, up 8% over last year, up 12%, excluding foreign exchange, a stunning 10% comp growth in the U.S. and North America, 5% comp growth globally. And except for China, very strong sales and comp growth in every international market we are in. We posted strong results despite challenging global consumer and inflationary environments, a softer quarter for retail overall and an unprecedented COVID-related headwinds that unfolded in China. Credit belongs to our partners around the world who continue to successfully satisfy record demand in our stores while delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers.In China, COVID-related mobility restrictions and a spike in COVID infections following the end of zero COVID resulted in comp sales of minus 29% for the quarter, 4x worse than what we expected. Weak sales combined with the cost to support the health, the safety and well-being of our partners, our first priority, negatively impacted total company earnings by $0.06, resulting in Q1 EPS of $0.75 per share. Despite short-term headwinds, we are confident that the end of Zero COVID marks the beginning of China's emergence from three years of pandemic, puts the country on a path to reintroducing normalcy and routine back into people's lives and positions the country to resume pre-COVID levels of consumer, social and economic growth. We also believe at the end of Zero COVID will enable renewed consumer activity in China and recovery of our business in the back half of fiscal 2023.Our view is informed by patterns of post-COVID behaviors we have seen in countries around the world as consumer activity accelerates as years of pent-up demand is released. Today, our stores in China are again open without restriction and our partners are back at work. Many have been infected and recovered from COVID. Noteworthy is that we saw a meaningful sequential improvement in sales and traffic as we move through January as people began resuming aspects of their pre-COVID lives, including gradually returning to our stores. More on China shortly. Our performance in Q1 underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people in extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in relevant innovation that together are driving sales and transaction growth around the world.Starbucks is more relevant globally today than ever before in our history, ideally positioning us to successfully execute our ambitious growth agenda and have roughly 45,000 stores delivering best-in-class returns around the world by the end of fiscal 2025. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our performance in Q1 and provide an update on the progress of our reinvention initiatives. I will then provide granular details specifically around the shape of our business in China and shine a bright light on the positive correlation between increases in consumer activity in China and the recovery of our business. Next, Brady will detail the beverage, food, mobile, digital and store innovation that drove record demand for Starbucks Coffee in every market outside of China in Q1.And he will speak to our record holiday performance, the strong growth in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership sequentially and year-over-year and the extraordinary record of $3.3 billion loaded on cards and gifted in the U.S. We entered Q1 with roughly $2 billion globally waiting to be spent in our stores, increased Starbucks Rewards membership and card loads serve as both a current annuity and the future driver of our business. And then finally, Rachel will highlight our Q1 financial and operating performance and speak to the confidence we have in our full-year 2023 guidance despite the significant impact from China, and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A. Let me begin with North America. The record demand for Starbucks Coffee in North America, we've reported on our Q4 call accelerated in Q1 and through holiday.Despite the difficult operating environment that most retailers, particularly brick-and-mortar retailers experienced in the quarter. Average weekly sales in the U.S. company-operated stores reached a record high in Q1, exceeding the prior record set in Q4 of fiscal '22. This is -- this next line, I think, is just -- even when I read it, I'm surprised, with eight of the 10 highest sales days in our history recorded in the quarter. Consistently strong demand drove revenues up 14% to a quarterly record of $6.6 billion and a comp sale of 10% over last year. And Q1 momentum has continued in Q2. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. exiting Q1 totaled over 30 million members, up four million members or 15% over last year and up 6% sequentially.Loyal Starbucks Reward members drove a record 56% of tender, up 3% from last year, reflecting increased customer engagement throughout our system. Our convenience channels, Mobile Order &amp; Pay, drive-through and delivery continue to fuel our business, delivering 72% of U.S. revenue in Q1. We continue to add high returning drive-throughs that attract new customers, expand our footprint and drive new customer occasions. Our over 6,600 store U.S. license business posted similar strong results with 32% revenue growth and double-digit comps across all operating segments. What's interesting to me is while grocery retailers are representative segment within our licensed business experienced traffic and spend related headwinds across their store base in Q1, their Starbucks business proved to be the bright spot bringing incremental traffic into their stores and driving sales for us as well.We continued to roll out Starbucks Connect enabling licensed stores to offer all Starbucks Mobile Order &amp; Pay and Rewards benefits, expanding the value offering we provide our customers and licensees and enabling us to capture demand across our broader store portfolio. Starbucks Connect is proving to be highly incremental, and we see great upside for it. Cross-functional teams continue to successfully execute against our reinvention initiatives and our reinvention investments are having a measurable positive impact on our business, evidenced by an 8% improvement in U.S. hourly retail partner turnover. Improved turnover correlates to more stable store environments, elimination of new hire-related costs, particularly training and measurable improvements in productivity, speed of service and partner customer experience scores that we're already seeing.Our Q1 performance demonstrates that our reinvention plan investments are the right investments that we are making and are delivering results and creating shareholder value, providing us with tremendous confidence in the revenue, margin and EPS expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. Let me turn to international. Outside of China, the momentum we saw in our International segment exiting Q4 continued in Q1. Excluding China and foreign currency translation, revenues for the quarter are up 25% and comps were up 11%, fueled by recovery consumption in Japan and a rebound in tourism activity across our EMEA markets, following the lift of COVID restrictions. One great example is Alshaya. Alshaya is our license partner in the Middle East for the last 23 years and among our largest international licensees with over 1,800 stores across 13 markets.They reported their strongest quarter with the Starbucks brand ever in Q1. We added 370 new stores in international in Q1 and now operate 18,700 stores across 84 markets, 43% company-operated and 57% licensed. Strong growth in our international license business reflects the outside returns the Starbucks brand delivers to our licensees, driving increased investment by our licensees in our business and growing customer engagement with our Starbucks brand around the world. Turning to channel development. The Starbucks brand relevant innovation and seasonal moments are resonating with our customers and driving sales and occasions around the world, resulting in a 15% increase in channel revenues in Q1 over last year to $478 million. We continue to hold the #1 dollar share in U.S. at-home coffee and in Q1 outpaced dollar sales growth in North America ready-to-drink category overall, again demonstrating the unique power of the Starbucks brand.In China, Starbucks received the ready-to-drink new product launch of the Year award for the introduction of Bottled Frappuccino Oat Latte. We will continue to delight our customers with exciting new beverage innovation in the months ahead, including with the launch of Starbucks ready-to-drink Pink Drink inspired by the overwhelming success of Pink Drinks served in our retail stores and certain to become a customer favorite, especially with our young customers and our Gen Z audience. Let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China now for over 24 years, and that our confidence in the future of Starbucks business in China and our aspirations for the market and our partners has never been greater. We exited Q1 with almost 6,100 Starbucks stores across 240 cities, and our newest class of stores continue despite the challenges we've had to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability.And we remain on plan to have 9,000 stores in China by the end of 2025. Our belief in China is based on our leadership position in the market, our relationship with our partners and the trust that we have among our Chinese customers and the market and our brand position. Since 2020, our Starbucks China team has been navigating the most acute COVID-related mobility restrictions and disruptions anywhere in the world, while at the same time, developing the flexibility to execute under any COVID scenario. By leading in together in service of their customers and fellow partners, our China team has navigated every challenge obstacle and volatility that COVID had put in their way, building more capability, flexibility and operating muscle with each unexpected test.That flexibility and operating muscle, coupled with deliberate investments that we've made throughout the pandemic, supported our business in Q1 and will increasingly drive efficiency, productivity, profitability and shareholder value and enable us to deliver an even more relevant and elevated Starbucks experience to our partners and our customers in the years ahead. As I shared on our last call, our recovery in China gained momentum in Q4 of 2022 despite severe mobility restrictions in many of our larger cities. We saw sequential improvement in all key operating metrics driven by the success of mobile and digital technology investments and expanded delivery capabilities built during COVID that made it easier for our customers to engage with us and better enable us to serve them.The direct positive correlation we saw between increased consumer activity in China and sales in our stores and the speed and consistency with which our business was accelerating, gave us great confidence moving through the quarter. However, in September, a new wave of COVID spiked resulting in further increased mobility restrictions, new mobile, digital and delivery capabilities enabled us to partially offset the reduction in store traffic in September. However, in early December, Zero COVID was lifted and COVID infection spiked across China, resulting in a dramatic decline in consumer activity across the country and causing the most severe COVID disruptions any retailer had encountered. For us, at its peak, nearly 1,800 Starbucks stores were closed during that month.As a result, comps in Q1 declined 29% with a 42% comp decline in December alone. But like consumers everywhere, our customers in China are creating a full return to familiar pre-COVID routines and lifestyles and huge consumer demand in China is waiting to be unleashed. Early indications are that it is beginning to happen in our largest cities now with many Chinese recovered from COVID, people returning to work, border and travel restrictions lifted, mall traffic and retail store activity on the rise and consumers reintroducing social activity back into their daily lives. We saw the strongest level of sustained customer activity we've seen in years in the run-up to and during Chinese New Year festivities. As Rachel would share, we are expecting the second half of fiscal 2023 in China to be stronger than the first half but uncertainties remain and the better part of valor is to remain cautious around precisely when our recovery in China will take full flight.However, when it does, pattern recognition, the return on pre-COVID routines and the adoption of new post-COVID routines will become self-evident in China, and customers will flock to Starbucks stores to enjoy moments of reconnection their favorite Starbucks beverages and the premium Starbucks experience our partners in China deliver. And Q1 headwinds will shift to tailwinds. We've seen this pattern repeat in markets around the world, including the United States. Despite the challenges and the uncertainties of the last three years, Starbucks' commitment to China and to our partners and business in China has never wavered. Almost 25 years after entering the market, I remain more confident than ever that we are still only in the early chapters of our growth story in China, and I'm looking forward to being with our China partners for the first time in years when I visit the country this Spring.Laxman's immersion continues to go spectacularly well. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more about our company and business and he wins the hearts and minds of Starbucks partners everywhere. Only weeks from now, Lax will take full control of the company and together with our leadership team, bring reinvention to life, guide Starbucks into a new era of growth and begin writing the next chapters of our storied history. I cannot be more confident that Lax is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks. And Starbucks Coffee Company domestically and around the world is in great hands with him as the CEO. This -- my last earnings call is very special for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life at Starbucks. It was 1983, walking the beautiful streets of Milan at the inspiration for what Starbucks could one day be and made first struck me.Starbucks, Coffee, JoinPhoto by Gema Saputera on Unsplash40 years later, I'm not sure where the years have gone. 40 years later, we have over 36,000 stores around the world, serving over 100 million customers each week. Along the way, we have created opportunity, cared for and improve the lives of millions of Starbucks partners and made progress against my goal of creating a different kind of company, a company steeped in humanity, humility and respect, where everyone is welcome, and we embrace the belief that our differences make us better and stronger. And a company unlike any company, my father ever got a chance to work for, but there's much more opportunity and much more work ahead. Finally, while Starbucks has launched many successful coffee beverages over the years, my Starbucks journey will come full circle when I return to Milan later this month to introduce something much bigger than any new promotion or beverage.While I was in Italy last summer, I discovered an enduring, transformative new category and platform for the company, unlike anything I had ever experienced. The word I would use to describe it without giving too much away is alchemy. We won't unveil details today, but it will be a game changer, so standby. Many people have asked me if my final earnings call as Starbucks CEO is bitter sweet, it really isn't. Starbucks business and brand, the quality of our coffee, the relevance of the Starbucks partner and customer experiences have defined us since our founding in 1971 and have never been better or stronger. And our future has never been brighter. It will be my pleasure to take a front row seat as Laxman leads Starbucks into and through the exciting new era of growth ahead.With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady.Brady Brewer: Thank you, Howard. I know I speak for so many when I say thank you for your relentless pursuit of elevating the Starbucks customer and partner experience. Your leadership to our reinvention has us well positioned to continue advancing towards our biggest aspirations with Laxman and our strengthened leadership team. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of our strong Q1 performance across all markets. Today, I'll focus on what we saw in the U.S. this quarter. In addition to the strong customer demand for Starbucks overall, our results benefited from last year's strategic pricing actions and increased food attached with record sales for both Sous Vide Egg Bites and breakfast sandwiches. Our product portfolio and innovations continue to resonate with customers, especially our cold, customized beverage innovation.Beverage sales increased 13%, led by our strength in the espresso category, with featured holiday beverages like the Caramel BrulÃ©e Latte and sugar cookie almond milk latte contributing to growth. Customized beverages continue to be a differentiator with customers all year long. Modifier sales were up 28% year-over-year in our U.S. company-operated stores, showing that customers are visiting Starbucks for beverages customized to their preferences that they cannot find anywhere else. The strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand continued to accelerate this holiday season as we surpassed, as Howard said, 30 million active Starbucks Rewards members, we drove record-breaking mobile order usage at 27% of transactions in the U.S. company-operated stores, and we reached an all-time high in the population of our weekly total active customer base.We also saw more than $3.3 billion loaded on Starbucks cards in the U.S., exceeding last year's record results and setting a new record. In fact, our gifting business was so strong that the unit sales of Starbucks Cards were greater than the next four brands of gift cards combined. This not only drives new Starbucks Rewards registrations, but it also drives our business in Q2 as evidenced by the high 56% Starbucks Reward tender that we saw in our U.S. company-operated stores at the end of the quarter. Said another way, during the holiday season, Starbucks truly becomes the currency of kindness and it drives our business. At the heart of Starbucks is uplifting human connection. This is a core part of our reinvention, and we accelerated our reinvention investments in the quarter, driving continued improvement in our industry-leading partner retention.We're also committed to elevating the customer experience. And within the quarter, we launched our first Starbucks rewards -- Reward Together partnership with Delta Airlines, which offers members of both Delta SkyMiles and Starbucks Rewards, new ways to earn rewards. On December 8, we also launched the Starbucks Rewards Odyssey experience in beta to select members. Odyssey members have been invited to partake in multiple Odyssey journeys driving increased engagement and loyalty from our members and now ownership in their loyalty experience. We also announced the national expansion of our partnership with DoorDash, which alongside Uber Eats also provides us the ability to serve customers in a convenient way and enjoy Starbucks wherever they are.And we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards redemption tiers, which not only supports critical program growth and discount efficiencies, but it also allows us to add increasing value relevant to our members by making popular items like cold coffee, more attainable, the changes that our members have praised. Finally, we're furthering the value delivered to our SR members by bringing them coffeehouse culture and content through a new series in the Starbucks app called the Starbucks Daily, which will launch with this month. In short, Starbucks is an incredibly strong brand and one that is poised for growth. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.Rachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am very proud of what we achieved in Q1 with nearly every business contributing to our strong performance. The remarkable strength in nearly all major markets and channels across the globe led to outperformance across our metrics when excluding the headwinds in China. Our Q1 consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion were another record quarterly high, up 8% from the prior year or 12% when excluding an approximately 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 5% net new store growth over the past 12 months, impressive momentum in our U.S. and international licensed stores as well as our channel development businesses.When excluding China and the impact from foreign currency translation, revenues in all three of our reporting segments continued to expand double-digit, demonstrating the demand of our diverse portfolio and power of our innovation as we focus on our new era of growth. Q1 consolidated operating margin contracted 60 basis points from the prior year to 14.5%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, part of which represent the reinvention plan, inflation and deleverage in China. The contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. The deleverage in China was more significant than expected, while other margin drivers were largely in line with our original guidance. Q1 EPS was $0.75, up 4% from the prior year, including an approximate $0.06 dilutive impact from the headwinds in China relative to our original expectations.Although we anticipated China's recovery to be nonlinear, the headwinds in Q1 were larger than our prior estimate by approximately $0.06 due to the unforeseen changes in COVID restriction and infection spikes. The significant strength across our global portfolio, however, largely offset the impacts from China's performance, keeping us on track to achieve our fiscal 2023 growth targets, as I'll discuss in a moment. First, I'll provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of all-time record revenue in Q1 of $6.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 9% increase in average ticket, net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months and very strong growth in our U.S. licensed store business.Our U.S. company-operated stores had a record revenue quarter with 10% comp growth in Q1, fueled by strength in digital, innovation, and record holiday performance as both Howard and Brady shared. In addition to the continued strength in ticket, the number of unique customers grew 10%, setting another all-time record and further expanding our reach. Let me also highlight the very strong performance of U.S. licensed stores this quarter, which posted revenue growth in excess of 30% and 15% system comp growth over the prior year Q1 with strength across the portfolio. Performance was particularly strong in retail and travel as pre-COVID behavior normalcy returns, with U.S. licensed store revenue indexing at roughly a 140% of pre-pandemic levels.Grocery also experienced strong growth, powered by the continued rollout of Starbucks Connect despite the overall decline in customer traffic across the rest of grocery store industry. North America's operating margin was 18.6% in Q1, contracting 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to previously committed investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and benefits as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage. While Q1 operating margin declined sequentially from Q4 fiscal 2022, driven primarily by seasonal sales mix shift, we gained productivity through reinvention, including improved partner retention and equipment rollouts, paving the way for progressive margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal 2023 and years to come.Moving to international. The segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1, down 10% from the prior year or up 2% when excluding a nearly 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was driven by sustained momentum across all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales, including a 29% decline in China. Although China posted a comp decline of 29% in Q1, the heaviest decline of 42% was experienced in December with pressure carrying into Q2, all of which was well below our original estimates, as mentioned in my opening. Just to give you a little color, at its peak, nearly 1,800 stores or close to 30% of our portfolio were temporarily closed due to sharp fall in traffic and labor shortage because of partners falling sick to COVID.Outside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe continued to outperform in Q1. Once again, these markets together achieved double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by transactions. Their revenue grew 25% in the quarter when excluding a 17% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation with successful holiday campaigns across all regions. Operating margins for the International segment was 14.3% in Q1, down 400 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage in China, but partially offset by strong sales leverage across other global markets and the resulting business mix. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 15% to $478 million in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses.Within the Global Coffee Alliance, newer platforms continue to be key drivers of growth, including Starbucks by Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Our ready-to-drink lineups are fueled by core platforms in our international markets and robust innovations in the pipeline. Sustainability was also top of mind for the segment, trailblazing recyclable, multi-serve iced coffee bottle made from recyclable plastic. The segment's operating margin was 47.4% in Q1, up 350 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by strength in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. Let me take a few minutes to go deeper on the implications to our business from the challenges we're facing in China.In January, China's comparable sales growth was a decline of approximately 15%, which was an improvement from a decline of 42% in December. While we're seeing early positive signs of momentum rebuilding, headwinds related to COVID still exist in the market and are expected to impact the full Q2. As a result, we anticipate the negative impact on the operating income in Q2 to be comparable to or greater than Q1. Although we previously projected China recovery as early as Q3 of this fiscal year, we do not have clear line of sight into the timing of recovery and believe China's contribution as a percentage of our fiscal 2023 consolidated operating income to be lower than our original guidance assumed. However, our long-term opportunity in China is very strong.We expect the market to see meaningful sales rebound once recovery is in full swing. Until then, we continue to stay focused on the long-term growth opportunities that China will deliver while weathering the short-term and transitory challenges. Now even with that backdrop and taking into account the uncertainty of China's recovery timing, our fiscal 2023 guidance remains unchanged. As a few point of clarification on guidance, in China, we now expect negative comps to continue through the second quarter, followed by improvement in the balance of the year. Another point of clarification is that China store growth remains unchanged as we execute our strategy to expand in new cities. Also, our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our reinvention plan and inflationary pressures which largely remain comparable to what we had originally anticipated.Lastly, our guidance reflects the latest projection of foreign currency translation with approximate two and three percentage point unfavorable impacts on fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings growth, respectively. This reflects an improvement of approximately one percentage point on both revenue and earnings growth relative to our previous expectations. Additionally, in terms of quarterly shape, operating margin is expected to decline sequentially in Q2, near prior year level driven primarily by the COVID-related headwinds in China. We still expect margins to expand in the back half of the year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4 as sales leverage, pricing, productivity gains from reinvention as well as recovery in China begin to contribute to positive margin expansion as the year progresses.We continue to expect the quarterly EPS shape to roughly mirror the shape of operating margin with a sequential decline in Q2 and a meaningful step up in the second half of the fiscal year. Lastly, we also remain committed to returning approximately $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025 between share repurchases and dividends. Our repurchase program resumed in Q1 of this fiscal year and will accelerate as reinvention gains ground. Since the inception of our dividend program, 51 quarters ago, our annual dividend growth has averaged greater than 20%, and our dividend payout rates near the top percentile of growth companies of our size and our scale, which is an exceptional complement to our long-term EPS growth target as high as 15% to 20%.In summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. First, our business and our brand are strong and strengthening every day as demonstrated by the record sales in Q1. Next, our Q1 performance serves as proof point that we are progressing nicely against our strategy, inclusive of our reinvention plan and delivering the results we projected. And finally, we will continue to innovate in the critical areas of digital, product and stores as our new era of growth is just beginning to unlock, and we are excited about what lies ahead, including welcoming Laxman as CEO this spring and on our second quarterly earnings call. Now before I close, I want to express my sincere gratitude for a hard work of our Starbucks Green Apron partners across the globe, including those in China who serve our customers in a way that only Starbucks knows how.Also, with this being Howard's last earnings call, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Howard for his vision to create a company that is truly different, where value is created for all. I know that I speak for many of us when I say we will honor your legacy while taking the company to the next level, all in making you, our partners, and our shareholders proud. With that, we'll open the call to Q&amp;A. Operator?See also 10 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$86.56 and falling to the lows of US$75.99. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Sysco's current trading price of US$76.91 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco Is Sysco Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Sysco is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $116.13, but it is currently trading at US$76.91 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Sysco’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Sysco?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 86% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sysco. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SYY is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYY for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SYY. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Sysco, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The company offers housewares, bed and bath, food, floor coverings, health and beauty aids, books and stationery, toys, and electronics; and other products, including hardware, candy, clothing, sporting goods, pet and lawn, and garden products.The stock performed well during the pandemic, but has missed earnings expectations five out of the last six quarters. This has helped the stock fall over 50% from all-time highs seen in 2020.While the stock has rallied off 2022 lows, investors might want to be cautious ahead of the next earnings report in March. Estimates are headed lower due to a challenging operating environment.About the CompanyOllie’s is headquartered in Harrisburg, PA. The company was founded in 1982 and employs 4,700 people. As of Oct 2022, the company operated 463 outlets in 29 states, primarily in the eastern half of the country.Ollie’s offers products under the following merchandise categories: Housewares (14.9% of 2021 Net Sales), Bed and bath (10.7%), Food (10.3%), Floor coverings (8.6%), Books and stationery (7.9%), Toys (6.4%), Health and beauty aids (5.9%). The remaining sales fit under the “Other” category and include hardware, candy, clothing, sporting goods, pet products, luggage, automotive, seasonal, furniture, summer furniture and lawn &amp; garden.The company boasts its Ollie’s Army loyalty program. This is a free membership in which you receive special discounts through both regular mail and email. The membership includes a point system in which you earn one point for every dollar spent.The company is valued at $3.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 24. OLLI holds Zacks Style Scores of “F” in Growth and Value. The stock pays no dividend.Q3 EarningsThe company last reported EPS on December 7th, missing expectations by 10%. Ollie’s reported Q3 at $0.37 v the $0.41 expected and missed on revenues. Despite sales trends improving in October, the company guided Q4 lower and now sees $0.78-.083 v the $0.95 expected.Ollie's cut FY22 to $1.57-$1.62 v the $1.78 expected and sees same store sales down 3.8%.Year over year margins were lower and inventories were up 11%. Management commented that they are pleased with the sales trends, but they are challenged by the highly promotional and inflationary environment.To sum the quarter up the sales are there, but costs to get those sales, as well as inflationary costs, are eating into the bottom line.EstimatesAfter the quarter, analysts lowered their estimates and cut their price targets. Over the last 60 days, there have been seven revisions to the downside for the current year. Earnings forced JPMorgan to immediately maintain its underweight and cut their price target from $54 to $42.Over the last 60 days, estimates for the current have gone from $0.95 to $0.80, a drop of 15%. For next quarter they have fallen 9%, dropping from $0.53 to $0.48.Looking ahead to next year, analysts have dropped their numbers 11% over the last 60 days, from $2.66 to $2.36.Technical TakeBulls have seen a 30% rally off the lows set in late December. This is partially due to the big market move higher since the start of 2023. But it also has to do with technical breaks of the 200-day MA, which caused a short squeeze.This issue the bulls will have over the next month will be that earnings report due in March. If price gets back under the $52 level, the bears gain back control. If this happens before earnings, the bulls could be at risk of seeing new lows on a bad earnings report.A move over the November high of $63 and the stock will look pretty good. So investors should expect a big technical fight between the bulls and the bear over the next month.SummaryThe current atmosphere is not good for deep discount retailers that thrive on margins. In an inflationary environment, margins contract and the company will become less profitable. While inflation has come in, it could be a while before Ollie’s starts to see improvement.Additional content:Meta &amp; Chevron Buybacks: Who Benefits Most?The Power of BuybacksBuybacks can be a fruitful endeavor for companies with lots of cash on hand (a good problem to have. For example, over the past decade, Apple has repurchased more than half a trillion worth of its own shares. The results speak for themselves.Buybacks can allow management teams to:·      Inflate earnings per share (EPS): Because buybacks decrease the number of shares outstanding, earnings are calculated against fewer shares. Higher EPS can make stocks more attractive to institutions and individual investors.·      Drive share prices higher: A lower supply of shares and more buying pressure can boost stock prices.·      Have skin in the game: When a company buys back shares, it signals that management has confidence in the future.·      Support dividend payments: Companies can finance dividend payments to shareholders. (CVX has raised its dividend for 36 years straight)Meta Platforms and Chevron couldn’t be on further ends of the spectrum in terms of their underlying businesses and stocks. Chevron is one of the world’s largest oil producers, a value stock, a dividend payer, and one of the top-performing stocks of the past year. Meanwhile, Meta is a growth-oriented tech stock known for its innovative social media portfolio and is coming off one of the worst performance periods since the stock came public.Despite their differences, both companies’ management teams have similar strategies in mind to boost their stock prices – massive stock buybacks.Massive Buyback ProgramsLast week, Chevron announced a massive buyback of $75 billion worth of stock after a record year of earnings – tripling its existing buyback program. Not to be outdone, Thursday, Meta increased its buyback plans by $40 billion – last year, the company purchased nearly $28 billion worth of its stock.Which Stock Will Benefit Most?If you want to learn more about the animals in the desert and how they act, sit in the desert and watch the animals. By the same token, if you wish to learn which stock benefited more from a buyback – watch the stock. Shares of CVX fell by 4.44% on above-average volume following the announcement. Conversely, shares of META soared more than 20% on volume nearly four times the average turnover.While both stocks gave investors good news, the reaction in shares tells investors two different stories. Meta may be ready for a turnaround year, while the good news may already be priced into CVX shares.ConclusionAround big news items in the stock market, the reaction to the news is often more important than the news itself. Zuckerberg and META’s management team have injected confidence back into shares of META. Furthermore, META is seeing improving estimates, sports a Zacks Ranking of 2, and has its lowest valuation in years.For these reasons, META is more likely to benefit in the coming months than CVX from its recent buyback.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The facility will allow ADM to supply growing markets for probiotics and postbiotics in the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe. ADM expects its customer base will more than triple over the next five years as more people recognize the links between the gut microbiome and many aspects of health and look for products tailored to their specific needs.The facility, the world’s first to produce both probiotics and postbiotics at the same site, will help the company fulfill its expansion strategy in the health and well-being sector. ADM is on its way to realizing its ambition to increase health and wellness revenue from over $500 million in 2022 to $2 billion within 10 years.""Health and well-being is one of the three enduring trends powering ADM’s growth strategy: Consumers are increasingly aware of the role their gut microbiome can play in their everyday lives, and they’re seeking nutrition solutions that are backed up by science-based research,"" said Mark Lotsch, president, Global Health &amp; Wellness. ""ADM is a leader in meeting this growing global demand, and we’re continuing to invest in the cutting edge of health and nutrition,"" he said.The site will produce ADM’s award-winning probiotic BPL1™* and the heat-treated BPL1™ postbiotic, as well as other ADM proprietary strains, supplying a broad range of customers. It will also be able to support further growth in ADM’s UK-leading Bio-Kult brand of products.The new facility is located close to ADM’s pioneering research and development center in the University of Valencia Scientific Park, where ADM scientists undertake activity including next-generation genome sequencing and early-stage testing of new bacterial strains.Story continuesMarket research estimates that the probiotic supplements retail market could surge to $10.4 billion by 2027 from about $8.3 billion in 20221. That growth is being driven by rising demand for science-based probiotic formulas that are used in dietary supplements, and also dairy products, food, healthy snacks and beverages, as well as pet and animal well-being products.* BPL1® is a trademark registered for Biopolis S.L. in the EU and other countries.1Euromonitor – Passport Data 2023About ADMADM unlocks the power of nature to enrich the quality of life.

PM is likely to register a decline in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 9. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7,442 million, suggesting a drop of 8.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has gone down from $1.32 per share to $1.29 in the past 30 days. The projection indicates a decline of 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.  Philip Morris has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.9%, on average. This tobacco giant reported an earnings surprise of 10.9% in the last reported quarter.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderPM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the third quarter of 2022, the proforma adjusted operating income margin was affected by investments related to expanding IQOS ILUMA, the elevated initial cost of ILUMA devices and related heated tobacco units or HTUs, supply-chain constraints (mainly due to the Ukraine war) and global cost inflation.For 2022, proforma adjusted operating margin growth on an organic basis is likely to come in the range of a decline of 50 basis points to flat. The gross margin is expected to be lower due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes (with supply restrictions easing), the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs. These factors and low cigarette volumes raise concerns for the fourth quarter.However, a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products is likely to have been an upside. Philip Morris is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating more than 30% of the company’s net revenues in the third quarter of 2022.The company has also been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has been aiding its revenues and adjusted operating income. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time.

Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 15.2%.Income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $66 million, or 40.5%, to $229 million from $163 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix. The increase was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher interest expense.GAAP earnings per share were reduced in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 by $0.67 per share and  $0.77 per share as a result of dividend equivalent payments made during each quarter. As a reminder, GAAP earnings per share are reduced when TransDigm makes dividend equivalent payments pursuant to the Company's stock option plans. These dividend equivalent payments are made during the Company's first fiscal quarter each year and also upon payment of any special dividends.Adjusted net income for the quarter increased 47.5% to $261 million, or $4.58 per share, from $177 million, or $3.00 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.Story continuesEBITDA for the quarter increased 24.5% to $650 million from $522 million for the comparable quarter a year ago.

EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 50.0% compared with 47.3% in the comparable quarter a year ago.During the quarter, TransDigm successfully completed a refinancing and repaid in full the approximately $1,725 million of Tranche G term loans maturing August 22, 2024, and replaced such loans with approximately $1,725 million of Tranche H term loans maturing February 22, 2027. The applicable interest rate for the Tranche H term loans is Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus 3.25%.""I am very pleased with our first quarter operating results and strong start to the fiscal year,"" stated Kevin Stein, TransDigm Group's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Total revenue ran ahead of our expectations and bookings outpaced revenues in all three of our major market channels - commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Our diligent focus on our operating strategy and the continued recovery of our commercial aftermarket revenues drove further progression in our EBITDA as Defined margin, which improved to 50.0% for the quarter, up approximately 270 basis points from the comparable prior year period.Additionally, trends in the commercial aerospace market continue to be favorable including international air traffic improving and China re-opening its air travel with the lifting of its pandemic restrictions. We are encouraged by these trends, among other factors, and look forward to the remainder of fiscal 2023.""Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.Fiscal 2023 OutlookMr. Stein stated, ""We are raising our full year guidance primarily to reflect our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.Non-GAAP Supplemental InformationEBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results. TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses, including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs.  Acquisition and divestiture-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Company's operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total outstanding shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.'s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group's management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group's management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group's management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; andEBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.Forward-Looking StatementsStatements in this press release that are not historical facts, including statements under the heading ""Fiscal 2023 Outlook,"" are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

96,ba7c659d-68c6-3566-bbc9-cf4450a35d6d,TDG,2023-02-07,Transdigm Earnings Preview: Can the Stock Continue its Epic Long-Term Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transdigm-earnings-preview-stock-continue-230311667.html,1675724591,STORY,['TDG'],"[Transdigm TDG, an aerospace manufacturing company, reports earnings Tuesday, February 7 before the market opens. In 2006 Transdigm went public on the New York Stock Exchange, and the stock has been incredibly successful since then, returning nearly 28% annualized for a cumulative return of 6,400%. Is it possible to maintain this breakneck appreciation?Transdigm, originally TD Holding Company, was founded in 1993 with a $10 million investment. The company was born out of leveraged buyout by private equity firm Kelso and Company, and the founders Nicholas Howley and Douglas Peacock in order to acquire and consolidate four industrial aerospace companies from IMO Industries Inc.TDG originally manufactured and marketed a small group of aircraft components such as batteries, pumps and, and fuel connectors. The company grew consistently over time through acquisitions completing more than 60 of them in the first 25 years. Between 1993 and 1998 TDG grew revenues 25 times.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ExpectationsTransdigm’s revenue comes from two primary segments. The companies airframes segment produces systems such as locking devices, security components, lavatory components, and parachute systems. TDG’s power and control segment produces actuators, specialized pumps, and other mechanical controls. Airframes make up 44% of revenue and power and control 53%. A third smaller segment, non-aviation producing refueling systems and ground transportation makes up about 3%.Transdigm is coming into this earnings period with momentum. Commercial air travel has seen a resurgence, and government spending is up significantly, particularly in the defense sector. Sales estimates for the coming quarter are projected to grow 14.3% YoY to $1.36 billion. Earnings are looking strong too, projecting a 44% increase YoY, bringing quarterly EPS to $4.31 a share based on Zack’s estimates.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesCatalystsAir travel is in a unique position currently. At one end of the spectrum, commercial air travel has picked up significantly since the Covid pandemic ended. Travel and hospitality continue to be some of the strongest sectors in the economy. On the other end, professional travel has dropped considerably, as has international travel.During the Covid pandemic, we saw Warren Buffett exit all his airline investments, because he believes travel has changed structurally. It will take several years to figure out how airlines will adapt and see what the business travel dynamic evolves into.Unique EdgeTransdigm has a unique advantage; it is run like a private equity firm or conglomerate. Management is always looking to diversify their product offerings through acquisitions. This structure can provide appealing risk to reward, as the business is run like an alternative investment. Alternative investment, meaning an asset that isn’t a traditional stock or bond, like a Hedge Fund, Real Estate, or Investment fund. What is appealing about these vehicles is that run properly, they can diversify the returns of a typical stock or bond portfolio.Although TDG remained correlated to the market over the past year, at the end of twelve months, it provided a return well in excess of the market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationTransdigm is a well-diversified and well managed business positioned for long-term sales and earnings growth. However, with a one year forward P/E ratio of 34x, its valuation is well above the industry average. Transdigm’s five-year low came in at 15x, while the high is 56x. This leaves TDG with quite a rich valuation currently.The unique edge of TDG, its overall business strategy as an alternative-like investment does earn it a premium valuation though. It has thus far proven to be a highly asymmetric investment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionTransdigm is a fantastic business, no doubt about it. But with a relatively high valuation, and a shifting commercial travel dynamic, the stock may run into some resistance.Alternatively, defense spending is up considerably. With the war in Ukraine seeming to have no end in sight, this should be a tailwind for TDG and other defense contractors. Furthermore, with the recent Chinese spy balloon, among other events with China, geopolitical tension is rising. Fears of further escalation in international wars are becoming more founded.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This compares to FFO of $3.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 0.32%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of $2.93 per share when it actually produced FFO of $2.97, delivering a surprise of 1.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Simon Property , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.33 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Simon Property shares have added about 10.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Simon Property?While Simon Property has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.83 on $1.31 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $12.12 on $5.32 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the bottom 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Realty Income Corp.

The brokerage insurer delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 3.80%.Factors at PlayWillis Towers’ fourth-quarter revenues are likely to have witnessed higher levels of regulatory work in Great Britain and increased project activity, growth in Medicare Advantage revenues, increases in advisory work and product sale.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.6 billion, indicating a decrease of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Risk and Broking is expected to have benefited from organic revenue growth across all regions, primarily driven by global lines of business, most notably in Aerospace, Natural Resources and FINEX.In the fourth quarter, the wealth businesses are likely to have gained from organic revenue growth from higher levels of regulatory work in Great Britain and increased project activity related to financial market volatility. The upside is likely to be partially offset by headwinds from the negative impact of capital market performance. Career businesses, comprising Work &amp; Rewards and Employee Experience businesses, are likely to have improved, given increased participation and sales in compensation benchmarking surveys and through increased project activity.Health revenues in the fourth quarter are likely to have benefited from demand for products and advisory work combined with new client appointments, gains recorded in connection with book-of-business settlements, new client appointments, increases in advisory work and product sale.Growth in Benefits Delivery &amp; Outsourcing is likely to have been driven by the individual marketplace and reflected growth in Medicare Advantage revenues in the direct-to-consumer business.Expenses in the quarter to be reported are likely to have increased because of higher restructuring costs and transaction and transformation.Continued share buybacks are anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $6.29, suggesting an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Willis Towers this time.

Our estimate for the metric stands at $1.95 per share.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $4,524 million, suggesting a 5.1% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number but higher than our estimate of $4,360.6 million.Earnings Surprise HistoryLincoln National’s earnings missed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average negative surprise being 168.03%. This is depicted in the chart below:Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLincoln National Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lincoln National Corporation Quote Factors to NoteThe top line of Lincoln National is expected to have suffered a blow due to reduced fee income and net investment income in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee income stands at $1,521 million, suggesting a decline of 6.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number and also came lower than our estimate of $1,618.2 million. The consensus mark for net investment income is pegged at $1,333 million, which indicates a fall of 7.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number but outpaced our estimate of $1,284.7 million.Nevertheless, LNC’s revenues are likely to have been partly offset by growing insurance premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter insurance premiums is pegged at $1,475 million, implying a 3.9% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure and higher than our estimate of $1,415.2 million.Only the Group Protection segment of Lincoln National is expected to have provided impetus to its quarterly results in the to-be-reported quarter. Strength in all products and market segments coupled with declining new group disability claims might have shaped the segment’s performance. The consensus mark for segmental operating income stands at $44 million, higher than our estimate of $13.8 million.Story continuesHowever, lower contributions from Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance units are likely to have strained the quarterly performance of Lincoln National in the fourth quarter.Drops in average account values and alternative investment income are expected to have dampened the performance of the Annuities as well as Retirement Plan Services segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the operating income of the Annuities unit is pegged at $277 million, which indicates a fall of 29.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number but came in higher than our estimate of $274.3 million.The consensus mark for operating income in the Retirement Plan Services segment stands at $55 million, suggesting a 19.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Alternative investment income and the continued incidence of COVID-19-linked claims are likely to have weighed on the Life Insurance segment’s performance in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for segmental operating income is pegged at $70 million, which indicates a decline of 27.8% from the prior-year quarters’ reported figure.Expense savings stemming from the Spark initiative are likely to have provided a boost to Lincoln National’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lincoln National this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: Lincoln National has an Earnings ESP of -0.84% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.87 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89.

115,971b087a-2545-3643-af20-ad7e51689abc,AIG,2023-02-07,5 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Multiline Insurance Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-prospering-multiline-153503196.html,1675697703,STORY,"['AIG', '^GSPC', 'PRU', 'MET-PE', 'HIG-PG', 'ORI']","[Product diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial HIG and Old Republic International ORI. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With seven hikes in interest rate in 2022, already one this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products as well as exposure to intangible assets offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by the analysts for the current year.    Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6.1% in the past year compared with the Finance sector’s increase of 4.8%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite declined 0.7% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of its trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 3.02X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.77X and the sector’s 3.63X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 3.14X, as low as 0.84X and at the median of 1.6X.Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)5 Multiline Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye onWe are presenting one Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, three Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks and one Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock from the Multiline Insurance industry.   You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The insurer delivered an earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other one, the average being 10.26%.Factors to ConsiderPremium growth is likely to have been driven by an increase in the reinsurance business and insurance business.The Insurance segment is likely to have benefited from growth across most lines of business driven by positive rate and exposure increases, new business and strong renewal retention.The Reinsurance segment is likely to have benefited from increases in casualty pro rata business and casualty excess of loss business, partially offset by a decline in property pro rata business and property casualty excess of loss business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums earned is pegged at $3.1 billion, indicating an increase of 10.8% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect net premiums earned to be $3.1 billion.Higher net written premiums are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.3 billion, indicating a 9.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure. We expect revenues to be $3.4 billion.Net investment income is likely to have been affected by a decline in limited partnership income. The downside is likely to have been partially offset by an additional income from fixed-maturity investments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is pegged at $194 million, indicating a decline of 5.4% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect net investment income to be $174.1 million.Higher-than-expected cat losses are likely to have weighed on underwriting profitability and thus combined ratio.Rate increase, exposure growth, prudent underwriting and traditional risk management capabilities are likely to have favored the combined ratio in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for the combined ratio is pegged at 89, indicating an improvement of 300 basis points from the year-ago reported number. We expect the combined ratio to be 87.8 for the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus estimate for the Reinsurance segment combined ratio is pegged at 86. The consensus estimate for the Insurance segment combined ratio is pegged at 88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Everest Re’s fourth-quarter earnings is currently pegged at a loss of $9.29, indicating an increase of 1.86% from the year-ago quarter reported figure.  We expect the bottom line to be $11 per share for the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for RE this time around.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

U.S. CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues increased 9.4% on a reported as well as organic basis.Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 15% as reported and 17% organically, driven by double-digit growth in subscription-based service revenues and strong growth in new veterinary software system placements.Total revenues for 2022 were $33.67 billion, reflecting a 4.7% rise from the year-ago period. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%.Our model projected full-year 2022 revenue of $33.51 billion.Segmental AnalysisIDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments — CAG, Water, Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) and Other.In the fourth quarter, CAG revenues rose 4.1% on a reported basis (up 7.9% organically) year over year to $748.5 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year EPS is currently pegged at $9.46.Our TakeIDEXX exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a decent note, with earnings and revenues beating estimates. The company registered year-over-year growth in revenues on both reported and organic basis. The top line was driven by continued benefits from the expansion of IDEXX's global premium instrument installed base. CAG Diagnostics’ organic recurring revenue growth reflects solid gains across IDEXX's major modalities globally, supported by growth in clinical service demand and expanded utilization of diagnostic products and services.On the flip side, LPD revenues declined in the quarter on a reported basis. Further, inflationary pressure has been weighing on the bottom line.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksIDEXX Laboratories currently carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

DXCM is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 9, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.67%. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, beat once and met the same once, the average negative surprise being 10.07%.Q4 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DexCom’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $811.8 million, indicating growth of 16.3% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 26 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 52.9% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteDexCom’s fourth-quarter top line is likely to have been aided by continued increase in volume, courtesy of new patients across all channels and rising global awareness about the benefits of its real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (“CGM”). Potential robust contributions from the Sensor segment and domestic and international revenue growth are likely to be the key catalysts for fourth-quarter results. The company’s preliminary results for the fourth quarter estimated total revenues to be $815 million, implying an increase of 17% year over year on a reported basis.During the first nine months of 2022, the company continued with expanding access and accelerating its leadership in CGM-connected solutions and customer choice. DexCom continues to launch the Dexcom ONE product in new countries. These developments are likely to have benefited customer growth during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Last year, the company received the FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation for the Dexcom CGM system’s use in the hospital setting. DexCom also secured the CE mark for the Dexcom G7 CGM System for monitoring people with diabetes aged two years and older, and initiated a limited launch of the system in Europe in 2022. DexCom expanded coverage for Dexcom CGM to include type 1 diabetes in Ontario, Canada. Moreover, TRICARE added Dexcom G6 as a brand-name formulary pharmacy benefit.Story continuesDexCom, Inc. Price and ConsensusDexCom, Inc. Price and ConsensusDexCom, Inc. price-consensus-chart | DexCom, Inc. QuoteThese developments may have favored the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. On an organic basis (excluding non-continuous glucose monitoring or non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months and the foreign exchange impact), fourth-quarter revenues are likely to have witnessed an uptick of 20% year over year.DexCom has been benefiting from demographic trends and lifestyles in countries outside Europe and the United States. Per the company, international growth remains strong and presents lucrative opportunities, courtesy of improving global access and awareness.In third-quarter 2022, international revenues (25% of total revenues) surged 22.2% year over year to $196.2 million. U.S. revenues (75% of total revenues) were up 17.1% in the same period. The momentum is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter, thanks to broad-based growth. The company’s preliminary U.S. revenues in the fourth quarter are estimated to be approximately $606 million, indicating a year-over-year uptick of 17%. Preliminary International revenues are estimated to be $209 million, implying an improvement of 15% from the prior-year period on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. and International revenues is pegged at $590 million and $215 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter.However, an increase in operating expenses and intense competition might have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for DexCom this time around.

AVTR reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 32 cents, down 11.1% year over year. However, the bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.7%.We had projected the fourth-quarter adjusted EPS to be 29 cents.GAAP EPS for the quarter was 21 cents, up 61.5% year over year.Full-year adjusted EPS was $1.41, flat compared to the end of 2021.

The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.3%.The fourth-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.78 billion.Avantor's foreign currency translation reflected a 4.5% headwind in the reported quarter, whereas M&amp;A had a positive impact of 0.7%, resulting in an organic sales decline of 2.1%. Excluding COVID-19 headwinds, Avantor's core organic sales growth rate was 2.7% during the reported period.Per management, the year-over-year uptick in the fourth quarter’s core organic sales reflected ongoing strength in Avantor's core business. However, this was partially offset by inventory destocking in liquid handling and single-use tubing, a weaker-than-expected year-end budget flush and headwinds resulting from fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2022.Full-year revenues were $7.51 billion, reflecting a 1.7% improvement from the comparable 2021 period. The full-year revenue compares to our estimate of $7.49 billion.Segmental AnalysisAvantor reports financial results in three geographic segments based on customer location — the Americas, Europe and AMEA (Asia, Middle-East and Africa).The Americas segment’s net sales were $1.05 million, reflecting a reported decline of 3.6% year over year. Core organic sales, however, inched up 0.1% in the reported quarter. The region witnessed strong growth in serum, process ingredients and excipients for bioprocessing and custom formulations for the semiconductor space, offset by destocking headwinds in liquid handling consumables and single-use tubing.Story continuesThis compares to our projection of fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $1.05 billion, in line with the company-reported number.Europe’s net sales were $617.2 million, reflecting a reported decrease of 10.1%, whereas core organic sales increased 6.3% year over year. Per management, the growth in core organic sales was driven by strength in bioproduction and biomaterials.This compares to our projection of fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $603.4 million.AMEA arm’s net sales were $129.8 million, indicating a reported fall of 3.1% year over year. Core organic sales increased 5.7% year over year, driven by sales of proprietary materials to advanced technologies and applied materials customers and bioproduction strength in process ingredients and excipients.This compares to our projection of fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $123.6 million.Avantor, Inc.

The gross margin, however, expanded 29 basis points (bps) to 34.2%.We had projected 34.6% of gross margin for the fourth quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 16.3% to $362.7 million year over year.Operating profit totaled $251.8 million, up 17.7% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The operating margin in the quarter also expanded 281 bps to 14%.We had projected 13.1% of the operating margin for the fourth quarter.Financial PositionAvantor exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $372.9 million compared with $301.7 million at the end of 2021. Total debt at the end of 2022 was $6.29 billion compared with $7.02 billion at the end of 2021.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of 2022 was $843.6 million compared with $953.6 million a year ago.GuidanceAvantor has initiated its financial outlook for the full-year 2023.The company expects to register reported growth of 0-2% for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently reflects a decline of 0.8%.Avantor expects to register organic revenue growth of 0-2% for the full year.COVID-19 headwinds are expected to be 2.5% for the full year. Excluding COVID-19 headwinds, core organic revenue growth is projected to lie within 2.5-4.5%.Avantor expects its adjusted EPS to lie within $1.35-$1.45 for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.39.Our TakeThe decline in Avantor’s adjusted EPS and the overall reported revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 is disappointing. The decline in the overall organic sales and reported revenues in each segment are discouraging. Macroeconomic factors like tighter financial conditions, global supply-chain constraints and the ongoing geopolitical conflict also raised apprehensions about the company’s financial strength.On the positive side, Avantor exited the fourth quarter with better-than-expected results. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its overall and segmental core organic sales, which is impressive. Strength in Avantor’s end markets is encouraging. The company’s pipeline of new product launches and robust demand from its bioproduction customers for its end-to-end fluid management solution also raise optimism about the stock. The continued demand for Avantor’s Ritter and Masterflex products also looks promising. The expansion of both margins also bodes well.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAvantor currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

120,d0d6716f-98d5-3b30-9bf7-1ad1682134e2,HOLX,2023-02-07,"Investors Heavily Search Hologic, Inc. (HOLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-hologic-inc-140002429.html,1675692002,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +8.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +8.3% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -58%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.66 points to a change of -39.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.7%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $962.81 million indicates a year-over-year change of -32.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.97 billion and $4.09 billion estimates indicate -18.3% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

Now, a new survey conducted by Jefferies is there showing that 62% of password borrowers would stop using its service. But despite the recent password-sharing headwinds, our next guest remains bullish on the stock. This is Jason Helfstein, managing director and head of internet research at Oppenheimer, who is joining us now.Jason, thank you. Just your big-picture thoughts-- does this help Netflix? Do they get away with this in the end? Are they able to make this a success?JASON HELFSTEIN: Absolutely. So they've been A/B testing this in South America. They would not be doing this if they thought they would end up in, you know, a worse revenue situation. The bottom line is there's a massive amount of password sharing, particularly amongst affluent people, let alone a broad part of their range.So we do think a good chunk of their subscribers will probably pay more to keep certain members of their household or, let's say, their children who no longer live with them, on their plan, or their mother, for example. But, you know, we think this is a net positive. They know what an advertising subscriber is worth. They know what password sharing is worth.And effectively, if you don't want to pay, you can go to the ad plan. And so I think that's what's gonna happen. You're gonna add more delineation between the tiers that they offer.- Jason, I think this is gonna be a really bumpy ride with subscribers. Do you think it'd be well received? Do you think there's some numbers here that they're not seeing, people that don't share passwords that might, in fact, drop the service? I'm talking about myself.JASON HELFSTEIN: They're not raising the price on you, so why would you drop the service?Story continues- Well, when you read these rules, and you hear that when you go out of town, you're gonna need a code, and when your kid goes somewhere, they're gonna need a code, and that type of annoyance, if they don't have extraordinarily sticky content, is going to make you re-evaluate your streamers.JASON HELFSTEIN: So first of all, I think they do have sticky content--- Yeah.JASON HELFSTEIN: --where we're at right now. They're spending more than everybody else in streaming, and they have a profitable business. And given the economic pressure that the media industry is facing-- and you can make an argument the media CEOs are trying to keep their jobs-- getting positive unit economics out of streaming is a priority. So I think we're past the point of competitors flooding the market with unprofitable content, which is what we saw for a good chunk of last year.So we do think, over the next 12 months, you'll see, I think, Netflix definitely with a competitive content advantage. And I think you saw it even in the last quarter. There was a comment that, actually, what has been talked about is not 100% what they're gonna do.So I don't think we know the final-- you know, the final, you know, for example, like, will you not be able to keep your college kid on the service, right? You know, it wouldn't surprise me if they come up with a way to make that happen, right, where, like, OK, every 90 days or something, your college kids has to authenticate in, like, some way, shape, or form.So this is a company that historically has prided itself on very, you know, customer service above all. I mean, they've arguably been the easiest of all streaming services. They've never required any authentication, never limited the number of devices, let you keep the most simple, easily-guessed passwords. And, look, the reality is people have taken advantage of it.I mean, sharing your Netflix account with 20 other people is probably not what the company had in mind. I think, if people are reasonable and share this with five or six people in their family, I think it's gonna work out.- If people are reasonable. All right, I want to get to gaming here because we haven't talked much about that. In fact, I haven't talked about that in weeks. Anything new on that front? And how is it looking in terms of their aspirations into the space?JASON HELFSTEIN: Yeah, I mean, we didn't really get much of an update. It's not something we're focused on. I mean, they do share a little bit of metrics I don't think most people are focused on it.It's a very longer-term initiative, whether it's using, taking IP of games, creating content, taking content, making games. Given the launch of the ad tier, right now, that is the big initiative for the next two years. And I think gaming, you know, very, very far on the back burner.- All right. The story of the year, at least to some, ChatGPT-- Google has announced they are just about finished with Bard. Their answer to ChatGPT should be rolling out in a few weeks. How far are they behind? What type of threat is ChatGPT to Google's search business?JASON HELFSTEIN: Yeah, too bad they couldn't call it Brad. I don't know. We're gonna mispronounce this as companies trying to come up with these different names.- Right?JASON HELFSTEIN: But we think it's well-known that Alphabet, you know, effectively has been the leader in AI with papers published. I think in 2017 is when they published the kind of leading paper on big models called-- basically [INAUDIBLE] someone called transformers-- no connection to the animated-- the ""Transformers"" franchise, but these models that allow you to actively, you know, use very big data to come up with these outputs.And so they have this data. They're spending a lot of money on it. What they didn't ultimately do is build that front end that allowed you to have that conversational interaction. You know, to use it, you had to effectively be a coder.So, look, I think ChatGPT caught Alphabet off guard. I think they're recognizing it. And I think this is gonna be the first version of what you see.I actually think this is an acceleration of their plan. I think the prior idea was that when they hosted their I/O day in May, they would announce a product. So I think they are absolutely fast-forwarding everything they can around AI to ultimately prove to the market that they don't believe they're behind OpenAI or ChatGPT.- I think the big win here is for consumers. We're gonna be surrounded by tech that is just too incomprehensibly great to comprehend. And, well, let's hope it gets used for the right way. Got to leave it right there. Jason Helfstein, thank you very much.]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Cumulus Media has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Netflix has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CMLS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CMLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.87, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 32.88. We also note that CMLS has a PEG ratio of 0.39. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.71.Another notable valuation metric for CMLS is its P/B ratio of 0.31. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 7.84.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, CMLS holds a Value grade of A, while NFLX has a Value grade of C.CMLS is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that CMLS is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Grainger GWW, Olympic Steel ZEUS, AllianceBernstein AB, Valero Energy VLO and Phillips 66 PSX.Bet on DuPont Analyst and Pick Up 5 Top StocksReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and the capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below, we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.

ACCO and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.5 Promising Price-to-Book-Value Stocks to Buy in FebruaryIt’s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than what they're worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is necessary to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.For narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization / book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Signet Jewelers, Phillips 66, Acco Brands Corp. and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Story continuesUnderstanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.

MUSA announced fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $5.21, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.16. The underperformance could be attributed to lower-than-expected petroleum product sales.However, MUSA’s bottom line was significantly above the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $4.23 per share, backed by a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 30.6 cents per gallon, up 11.3% year over year.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.4 billion rose 12.6% year over year and brushed past the consensus mark by $47 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.Merchandise sales, at $989.4 million, rose 6.7% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $970 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4.3 billion, falling 1.8% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but up 13.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021.Murphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Murphy USA Inc. Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution rose 20.1% year over year to $369.3 million due to margin expansion and higher volumes. Total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 30.6 cents per gallon, which improved more than 11% from the fourth quarter of 2021.Retail fuel contribution increased 19.6% year over year to $341.2 million as margins widened to 28.3 cents per gallon from 25.5 cents in the corresponding period of 2021. Retail gallons rose 7.8% from the year-ago period to 1,206.3 million in the quarter under review and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 5.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021 to 241.6 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.19 per gallon, up from $3.05 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 4.2% to $189 million on higher sales, which more than offset the fall in unit margins, from 19.6% a year ago to 19.15% in the fourth quarter of 2022. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 3.1% year over year, primarily on the back of 5.5% higher tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 4.4% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were up 5.4% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 4.7% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Dec 31, Murphy USA — which opened 13 new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,712 — had cash and cash equivalents of $60.5 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 73.7%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $239.5 million.GuidanceThe company projects 2023 fuel volume in a range of 240 to 245 thousand gallons on an APSM basis. Further, Murphy USA’s 2023 guidance includes up to 45 new stores and up to 30 raze-and-rebuilds, $795-$815 million in merchandise margin contribution, and $375-$425 million in capital expenditures.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.34. However, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $2.94 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins improved to $19.73 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $11.95. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $25.03 and $19.58 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $12.60 and $11, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $16.35 per barrel from $10.16 in the prior-year quarter. The West Coast witnessed an increase in margins from $15.80 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.77 in the December-end quarter of 2022.But another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.45 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.4 billion, surging from $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.At the end of 2022, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion. Valero’s fourth-quarter capital investment was $640 million. Of the total, $349 million was allotted for sustaining the business.Marathon Petroleum MPC, also a downstream biggie, reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 and compared with a profit of merely $1.30 per share in the year-ago period. MPC’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $849 million on capital programs (59% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $651 million in the year-ago period. As of Dec 31, MPC had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 43.9%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

132,20f79181-9669-37b1-afd8-4c5fa5164074,PSX,2023-02-07,5 Promising Price-to-Book Value Stocks to Buy in February,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-promising-price-book-value-121612930.html,1675685772,STORY,"['SIG', 'DBK.DE', 'ACCO', 'PSX']","[It’s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than what they're worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is necessary to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.For narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization / book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB, Signet Jewelers SIG, Phillips 66 PSX, Acco Brands Corporation ACCO and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.

Freeport can turn about 2.1 billion cubic feet of gas into LNG each day, which is about 2% of total U.S. daily gas production.""We continue to progress our work towards the safe restart of our liquefaction facility,"" Freeport LNG spokesperson Heather Browne said in an email. The company had no comment on the gas flows to the plant.Many analysts have said they do not expect the plant to return to full power until mid March or later. A couple of Freeport's customers - Japan's JERA and Osaka Gas - have said they do not expect to get LNG from the plant until after March.Last week, Freeport told Texas regulators it would start sending gas to one of three liquefaction trains, which turn gas into LNG.The plant, however, is waiting for permission from federal regulators to start loading LNG on ships to free up space in its storage tanks.Freeport, the second biggest U.S. LNG export plant, shut after a fire in June 2022.The energy market expects gas prices to rise once the plant starts producing LNG again.But gas futures were trading near a 25-month low mostly because mild weather this winter has kept heating demand for the fuel low.Federal regulators will hold a public meeting on Freeport on Feb. 11 to provide members of the community and other interested parties an opportunity to voice concerns about Freeport's restart plans and to receive an update on what is happening at the plant.

So if gas is good for you to run an economy but it's bad for me to generate power, there's a problem,"" Makamba told the conference in Bengaluru.Japan also stopped financing two coal power plant projects in Indonesia and Bangladesh in June, responding to global criticism over its continued support for the polluting fuel.Top global lenders - under pressure from investors, Western governments and campaigners - have squeezed credit lines that finance projects based on fossil fuels in a bid to achieve net-zero emissions across their financing portfolios.Government officials in some countries and industry officials call this discriminatory.""The choices for me to be able to increase (energy) access and consumption cannot be impaired by politics that have nothing to do with me,"" Makamba said.PRICED OUTBir Bikram Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the energy adviser to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said a surge in gas prices after sweeping sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine made LNG inaccessible for the south Asian country.Story continues""There were ships floating around Western Europe carrying gas, and other countries were not able to buy because of the price,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.Bangladesh, which counts on natural gas for over two-thirds of its power generation, was one of the worst hit by the surge in LNG prices. Major cities in Bangladesh were forced to resort to hours of power cuts during the second half of 2022, disrupting commercial and industrial activity.""Western countries literally priced us out of market,"" Chowdhury said.Zimbabwe, where electricity shortages were among the key reasons for slower economic growth in 2022, is still far from transitioning from traditional sources of power, its deputy energy minister Magna Mudyiwa said.""We are a growing economy, plenty of mining is going on, plenty of agriculture is going on. We still need some more electricity in Zimbabwe. And then we can talk about transitioning from what we have to green energy,"" she said.India, the world's second largest consumer, importer and producer of coal, has often defended high use of the polluting fuel, saying its per capita emissions were lower than richer nations and it needed a cheap source of energy to ensure supplies.A growing risk of power outages due to sanctions on its main gas supplier Russia forced the European Union to double down on coal for power generation last year, inviting criticism from climate activists.Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' climate envoy and designated COP28 president, said ""the Global South, where almost 800 million people have no electricity,"" should be empowered in ""an inclusive energy transition.""""The energy transition has the potential to generate the greatest leap in economic prosperity since the first industrial revolution. But it must be fair,"" Jaber said.""When it comes to the Global South, they have seen little justice so far."" (Writing by Sudarshan Varadhan Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Operating profit for full year 2022 was $264 million, or 3.6 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $679 million, or 9.4 percent of sales.""Our fourth quarter results reflect a strong finish to a year that saw rising demand for NOV’s products and services, gradually normalizing global supply chains, and improving execution by our organization,"" stated Clay Williams, Chairman, President, and CEO. ""For the past two years, our short-cycle businesses within North America have driven our post-pandemic recovery. As we completed 2022, we began to see international and offshore markets inflect and accelerate, a trend we expect to drive improving orders for our longer-cycle businesses over the next few years and beyond.""Story continues""While recent declines in North American natural gas prices and persistent global recession risks may pose near-term headwinds to oilfield activity, we believe that the world simply must rebuild and fortify its petroleum supply capability soon and a sustained oil and gas up-cycle is required to increase energy security across the globe. Years of chronic underinvestment and a pandemic lockdown that severely stunted capacity make this up-cycle all the more urgent and daunting. NOV is up to the challenge. We stand ready to equip the industry with the tools necessary to do the job efficiently, economically, safely, and with minimal environmental impact.""Wellbore TechnologiesWellbore Technologies generated revenues of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of three percent from the third quarter of 2022 and an increase of 32 percent from the fourth quarter of 2021.

The drillship is the most technically capable drilling rig in the world, equipped with the world’s first two 20,000-psi subsea blowout preventers (BOPs), the world’s first three-million-pound hook load hoisting system, and the world’s first five 10,000-psi mud pumps. NOV developed, tested, and manufactured more than 30 new products for the rig in preparation for 20,000-psi operations with a super major in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These products were qualified and delivered on time – a testament to NOV’s unmatched expertise in providing innovative and differentiated drilling solutions to the offshore industry.NOV sold 20,000 horsepower of Ideal™ eFrac pressure pumping equipment to a leading North American stimulation service company during the quarter. NOV’s 5,000 HHP Ideal eFrac pumps consistently displace up to three conventional frac units on location and are proven to reduce operational expenses on pump maintenance by up to 30%.NOV secured orders from two customers for the design licenses and jacking systems of two NG-20000X wind turbine installation vessels. Designed for larger and heavier next generation wind turbines, the NG-20000X is intended for use in harsh environments and water depths of up to 70 meters. With its fourth and fifth orders for this class of vessel, NOV continues to prove its ability to develop new industry standard solutions for vessels and jacking systems by working closely with key market players and customizing NOV’s proprietary technology to our customers' specific needs.NOV signed a contract with a major semiconductor manufacturer to supply FM 4922-compliant fume-and-smoke exhaust composite ducts designed to reduce fire risks in cleanroom operations. The multi-million-dollar award is destined for a new $17 billion semiconductor plant project under construction in Taylor, Texas. This order represents NOV’s entry into FM 4922-compliant composite ducts.NOV received two orders for new, leading-edge drill pipe product offerings. NOV received orders from the Middle East for its newly introduced, high-strength 135-KSI drill pipe for use in mildly sour environments, delivering the performance of an S135 product with the added benefits of sulfide stress cracking resistance. The strings will incorporate Grant Prideco’s Delta™ connection, which has become the premier choice for drilling wells around the world. NOV also received an award from a major National Oil Company in the Asia Pacific region to drill extremely challenging wells using Grant Prideco™ drill pipe with TurboTorque™ (TT™) ultra-high torque connections. TT connections are the industry’s first rotary-shouldered connections designed to meet the specific needs of each pipe size. Taking a ""one size does not fit all"" approach, the TurboTorque product line has three distinct configurations optimized to best meet individualized performance objectives. Grant Prideco’s technical support and guidance throughout the drill string selection process, as well as the historical performance of the connection, made NOV an easy choice for the customer.NOV signed a contract with a major engineering, procurement, and construction company to supply composite piping systems for production facilities associated with the Tilenga project in Uganda. NOV’s operations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia regions will supply engineering services, composite piping systems, fabrication, and field services to complete the project in 2023.NOV secured several large tenders in the West African region for its Viper™ Connectors, an encouraging signal of recovering activity for a key deep-water market. Developed for deep-water and ultra-deep-water projects where reliability and fatigue performance are paramount, the field-proven Viper connector is the top choice for extreme-service conductor and casing applications.NOV established a new performance benchmark with its Agitator™ZP friction reduction tool while drilling a deviated three-mile lateral in the 6¾-inch section for a major operator in West Texas. Throughout the run, the AgitatorZP tool enabled the operator to maintain high motor differentials and flow rate. The AgitatorHE On-Demand system, placed higher in the string, only had to be activated for the final 1,600 feet of the lateral. Improved drilling performance and directional control, along with the ability to rotate and slide efficiently with zero pressure drop, led to subsequent two- and three-mile runs with the same operator.NOV supported pioneering efforts to more efficiently develop geothermal resources during the quarter. In December, the Department of Energy awarded $9 million to the GLADE (Geothermal Limitless Approach to Drilling Efficiencies) project for drilling a pair of geothermal wells under the DJ Basin in Colorado. ReedHycalog will support the drilling operations with its Phoenix™ series drill bits, incorporating the latest ION+™ cutter technology. Additionally, NOV secured an award to supply drill bits for a key geothermal client in East Africa and delivered drill bits for geothermal drilling programs in Italy and Switzerland.NOV secured two new geothermal contracts for its TK™-Liner in Europe. The project is a first-of-its-kind for Denmark and a significant milestone for Tuboscope™ and TK-Liner in the European renewables / geothermal heating market. As countries across Europe continue to seek ways to phase out coal to meet climate targets, the success of this project will potentially inspire other nations to consider geothermal as a viable heating solution for homes. Since 2020, Tuboscope has supplied more than 28 miles (48 km) of large-diameter TK-Lined pipe for geothermal applications.NOV’s Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) team secured several significant contract awards during the quarter. A major offshore drilling contractor conducted a system evaluation and chose NOV MPD as the new standard for its Applied-Surface-Back-Pressure MPD system across its fleet of rigs. NOV will deliver the first MPD Integrated-Riser-Joint package to the customer with additional orders expected to follow. A second significant MPD order received during the quarter, bound for offshore Western Australia, includes a topside manifold and slimline jack-up rotating control device system. As deck space is at a premium onboard any offshore rig, the reduced footprint of NOV’s system as well as its ability to accommodate a variety of topside arrangements was a key differentiator for the customer.NOV’s Downhole Broadband Solutions (DBS) business continues to gather market momentum with its full suite of drilling optimization services that include visualization tools, wired drill pipe (WDP), downhole drilling tools, and real-time sensors. Two major independent customers, pleased with the improved drilling and wellbore construction performance enabled by NOV’s DBS products, signed contract extensions for drilling operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Additionally, NOV received its first order for wired Delta™ pipe connections for a major operator in Qatar. Combining real-time downhole data with the performance and total cost advantages of the Delta connection represents a huge advancement for both technologies. Customers continue to recognize the value that DBS technology provides, not only for enhancing drilling operations but also for improving the net-to-gross reservoir ratio in production formations worldwide.Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference CallNOV will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2022 results on February 7, 2023 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time).

In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.20.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of $1.17 per share, indicating an improvement of 14.6% from a loss of $1.37 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $941.1 million. The metric suggests a deterioration of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS SurpriseWynn Resorts, Limited price-eps-surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors to NoteWynn Resorts’ fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from its Las Vegas operations, improved bookings trends and sports betting expansion. During the previous quarter, the company stated that room bookings are pacing at (or above) pre-COVID levels on substantially higher ADRs. Also, it reported strength across rooms, entertainment and retail on a year-over-year basis. With group businesses returning back, the momentum is likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter.Emphasis on its non-gaming business and development projects is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Recently, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Realty Income Corporation for the sale-leaseback of its real estate at Encore Boston Harbor. Valued at $1.7 billion, the financing and capital structure decision is likely to have enhanced the company’s financial flexibility in terms of retiring its near-term debt and for deploying capital for the construction of additional parking and complimentary non-gaming amenities.However, tighter travel restrictions, quarantine policies and reduced accessibility of transportation is likely to have affected the company’s Macao operations in the fourth quarter. Although sequential improvements in visitation are likely, it is still expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Wynn Resorts this time around.

156,17149971-0944-36f7-b38f-9d87bc81b8b4,PDCO,2023-02-07,"Is Patterson Companies, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PDCO) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Financials In Any Way?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/patterson-companies-inc-nasdaq-pdco-155232433.html,1675698752,STORY,['PDCO'],"[Patterson Companies' (NASDAQ:PDCO) stock is up by 9.5% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Patterson Companies'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Patterson Companies is:19% = US$198m ÷ US$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Patterson Companies' Earnings Growth And 19% ROEAt first glance, Patterson Companies seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. As you might expect, the 6.3% net income decline reported by Patterson Companies is a bit of a surprise. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Patterson Companies' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 16% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Patterson Companies is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Patterson Companies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a high three-year median payout ratio of 51% (implying that 49% of the profits are retained), most of Patterson Companies' profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Patterson Companies by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Moreover, Patterson Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 43%. As a result, Patterson Companies' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 19% for future ROE.SummaryIn total, it does look like Patterson Companies has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return. Investors could have benefitted from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The estimated figure indicates a 1.5% decline from the year-ago level. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $1.91 billion, indicating a 5.4% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Factors to NoteMasco is likely to have generated lower earnings and revenues on a year-over-year basis in fourth-quarter 2022. The slowdown in the housing and repair and remodel markets is likely to have ailed MAS’ top-line performance. The bottom line is expected to have been dented by intense inflationary pressure, particularly on commodities and logistics and supply-chain issues in the quarter to be reported. Also, inflation is likely to have increased for raw materials, freight and labor.Apart from the above-mentioned costs, MAS persistently incurs expenses related to product launches and acquisitions. Overall, the company expects lower market demand, elevated operational costs and additional foreign currency headwinds in the fourth quarter due to the evolving market conditions. Owing to these challenges, the company expects full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to be $3.70-$3.80 per share. In 2021, the company reported $3.70 in earnings per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products’ sales of $1,143 million indicates a 6.9% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The same for the Decorative Architectural Products segment’s sales is currently pegged at $782 million, calling for a 1.5% decrease from the year-earlier quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for Plumbing Products’ non-GAAP operating profit is pegged at $170 million, suggesting 9% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

Tyson is knifing, testing some of the lowest levels in price since 2020, also having its worst day since, guess what, last quarter. Much like then, its margins are in focus as volatile commodity prices make pricing a challenge. And you can see that is a max chart on your screen going back to the 1980s, quite the top in there. Now Consumer Edge is noting that the beef segment-- in particular flagging the elevated cattle prices and also the feed for pork, that's getting expensive as well. An analyst does say, quote, ""it's pricing power at retail has been made clear along with efficiency and capacity levers to pull."" So a little bit more there in coming quarter. Now Consumer Edge rates the stock overweight with a $90 price target.Stephens, another firm, still likes the stock, keeping it an overweight and saying earnings likely have now troughed. So the bottom, perhaps, in, but the analyst is reviewing the price target due to a lack of near-term catalysts. And the stock is still interesting to long-duration investors. I'll just quickly say, Staples great play last year, as we experienced the worst year for 60-40 in probably our generation and many generations. Not necessarily so this year, so maybe a different strategy for investors.- Yeah, you mentioned the margins also, concern for them being that their data finds that consumers are spending less on those pricier cuts of meat, and I was really surprised to see the price of beef down 8.5% in the same quarter last year while chicken's--- I'm bidding it up.- --up 7%. So complete opposite directions. You're what?- I'm bidding up the price of beef.- Oh, you're a big beef eater?- I'm getting as much-- I am, and now we have a Whole Foods--Story continues- I know.- --in the Financial District. Jared and I run into each other at the Whole Foods all the time.- No place else.- It's worth it. [LAUGHS]- Tyson Buffalo Tenders, that's my tip, guys.- Well, I--- They're underrated.- You know what I thought was interesting? Is that the prepared foods was the only business segment to show an increase in operating income, and you have to wonder if that's maybe a trend that we'll see throughout this year, consumers gravitating towards those more convenience items amid inflation. We saw that during the pandemic, maybe in the future.- Makes sense.- Yes. Unfortunately--- I know I do. I like the convenience frozen foods--- I cannot resist them,- --all the time.- Ally, thank you for playing with us today.]"

Revenue slightly missed expectations of $13.52 billion, with a reported $13.26 billion.On a call with analysts, CEO and President Donnie D. King said, ""Market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted [our] profitability.""Weakened consumer demand caused prices to fall for many products, which resulted in Tyson paying more and having more in supply.""The average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for beef,"" John R. Tyson, Tyson Foods CFO said on the company's earnings call.Beef sales for the mega food processor came in at $4.7 billion, down 5.6% compared to a year ago. Higher cattle costs, up $530 million, also hit the company.""We saw higher cattle prices as beef herd numbers continue to decline. We will continue to monitor the beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products,"" Tyson said.WASHINGTON, DC: A man shops in the meat section at a grocery store. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Tyson Foods remains bullish on beef though. ""We have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for beef. This outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand, specifically in Asia, and the strengthening drop credit as well as opportunities to shift our beef products up the value pyramid.""Pork also brought down the recent quarter. In that segment, sales were down 6% to $1.5 billion. Pork's average sales price was up 1.4%, while volume was down 7.4%.Chicken sales posted a record high of $4.3 million, up 9.6% from last year. A 2.5% increase in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing drove sales higher.However, CEO King said, ""a few different things didn't go as planned"" within its chicken segment.Story continues""Most notably, demand didn't appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. As a result, we had to move things around, and we experienced higher costs, a lower price environment and knock-on effects from a network standpoint,"" King said.For fiscal 2023, the company maintained its total company sales guidance of $55 billion to $57 billion, which implies 3% to 7% sales growth.""We anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessons and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. The fall in commodity chicken prices driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness does not change our strategy,"" Tyson noted in the call.Shares of Tyson Foods are down more than 31% from a year ago.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Heavy vehicles like trucks and buses account for about a quarter of those transport emissions.A fully electric 40-tonne tractor-trailer emits 63 percent lower emissions compared to diesel trucks over 1.3 million kilometres (808,000 miles) travelled, according to new research Tuesday from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) think tank.This calculation accounts for the emissions associated with the extraction of raw materials, construction and maintenance of the vehicle using the EU's average electricity grid mix.""The problem is not the factory but the road,"" said Nikita Pavlenko, ICCT's fuels team lead.""The high greenhouse gas intensity of driving a truck during its whole life offsets the (greenhouse gas) emissions generated during manufacturing or the production of the fuel, or the energy it consumes.""The research found that emissions will fall even more as the EU's electricity grid further decarbonises, enabling an 84-percent reduction of emissions when using only renewable sources of power.It also found that trucks and buses using natural gas provide marginal emissions reductions, just four to 18 percent lower than their diesel counterparts.Methane, which leaks from vehicles using natural gas and throughout the production and supply of the gas, is a significant driver of those emissions.While more electric buses and light vehicles are on the road throughout the EU, diesel still powered 99 percent of trucks sold in Europe in 2021.tsz/jv/mh/lth]"

So if gas is good for you to run an economy but it's bad for me to generate power, there's a problem,"" Makamba told the conference in Bengaluru.Japan also stopped financing two coal power plant projects in Indonesia and Bangladesh in June, responding to global criticism over its continued support for the polluting fuel.Top global lenders - under pressure from investors, Western governments and campaigners - have squeezed credit lines that finance projects based on fossil fuels in a bid to achieve net-zero emissions across their financing portfolios.Government officials in some countries and industry officials call this discriminatory.""The choices for me to be able to increase (energy) access and consumption cannot be impaired by politics that have nothing to do with me,"" Makamba said.PRICED OUTBir Bikram Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the energy adviser to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said a surge in gas prices after sweeping sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine made LNG inaccessible for the south Asian country.Story continues""There were ships floating around Western Europe carrying gas, and other countries were not able to buy because of the price,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.Bangladesh, which counts on natural gas for over two-thirds of its power generation, was one of the worst hit by the surge in LNG prices. Major cities in Bangladesh were forced to resort to hours of power cuts during the second half of 2022, disrupting commercial and industrial activity.""Western countries literally priced us out of market,"" Chowdhury said.Zimbabwe, where electricity shortages were among the key reasons for slower economic growth in 2022, is still far from transitioning from traditional sources of power, its deputy energy minister Magna Mudyiwa said.""We are a growing economy, plenty of mining is going on, plenty of agriculture is going on. We still need some more electricity in Zimbabwe. And then we can talk about transitioning from what we have to green energy,"" she said.India, the world's second largest consumer, importer and producer of coal, has often defended high use of the polluting fuel, saying its per capita emissions were lower than richer nations and it needed a cheap source of energy to ensure supplies.A growing risk of power outages due to sanctions on its main gas supplier Russia forced the European Union to double down on coal for power generation last year, inviting criticism from climate activists.Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' climate envoy and designated COP28 president, said ""the Global South, where almost 800 million people have no electricity,"" should be empowered in ""an inclusive energy transition.""""The energy transition has the potential to generate the greatest leap in economic prosperity since the first industrial revolution. But it must be fair,"" Jaber said.""When it comes to the Global South, they have seen little justice so far."" (Writing by Sudarshan Varadhan Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Expedia Group would be silly to remove vacation rentals from Expedia.com. Rumors have surfaced on social media that Expedia Group would announce this Thursday during its fourth quarter earnings call that customers would no longer be able to book vacation rentals on Expedia.com — but that’s not going to happen because it would be self-sabotage.The rumors would have you believe that Expedia Group would push its Vrbo vacation rental brand as the only place to book homes within the Expedia Group orbit, unlike today where you can book them on brands such as Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Travelocity, Orbitz, eBookers, Wotif, Trivago, and Vrbo.com.A Vrbo-only vacation rental trip planning and booking policy would deprive Expedia Group of all of those reservations and stays coming through that assortment of other in-house brands. Expedia Group, which acquired HomeAway/Vrbo in 2015 for $3.9 billion in perhaps one of its best acquisitions ever, has spent years and untold millions of dollars doing precisely the opposite of the rumors — ensuring that Vrbo’s vacation rentals could be expanded to, visible and bookable on Expedia.com and other Expedia Group brands in addition to Vrbo.During the early stages of the pandemic when hotels were shut down, Vrbo, vacation rentals and domestic travel were the saviors within the Expedia Group portfolio. Having them bookable on Expedia.com as well as on Vrbo was a benefit.Many of the major global online travel brands, including Booking Holdings and Airbnb, enable travelers to find short-term rentals and hotels mixed together in one place. Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel has numerous times talked about the benefits of having all accommodations types available together in one place so customers can find accommodation types of their choosing depending on their trip purposes and inclinations.In fact, several years ago, the tabs atop Expedia.com’s homepage, and those of other online travel companies transitioned from separate “hotels” and “vacation rentals” categories to “stays” to reflect that mashup.Story continuesExpedia.com used to have separate “hotels” and “vacation rentals” tabs but today combines them in “stays.” The company has spent years laboring at different ways to combine these disparate property types but resolved to keep them together.It is certainly possible that Expedia Group might prune some vacation rental listings, and move them from one platform to another, if the company deems that appropriate for the website or typical customer type.But relegating vacation rental bookings to Vrbo only would be as fruitful as allowing flight bookings for Airbus aircraft only, and eschewing Boeing planes.Forget about it.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

It guides our commitment to making a positive impact on the world. It also means we recognize the importance of being a responsible and sustainable business; not just for our own success, but for the well-being of our planet and the communities we serve. We're delivering on this commitment by working on improving access for underserved travelers, democratizing the travel business by creating a fairer travel economy and continuously striving for innovation to shape a sustainable future for travel.As part of this effort, we launched the first Expedia Group Accelerator initiative last September.

The first program focuses on empowering companies that are working to increase access for underserved travelers. Next year, the Accelerator initiative will launch an additional program focused on co-developing new capabilities.""We're excited to leverage our expertise with Expedia Group on how we can make the world accessible; that's our purpose as a company."" - Alvaro Silberstein, co-founder &amp; CEO of Accelerator finalist Wheel The WorldAfter careful consideration, we're thrilled to announce the 12 finalists for this year's program who were selected from a pool of hundreds of applicants across the globe. Each company is a true trailblazer with its own unique story and works tirelessly to break down barriers for travelers.Increasing access for travelers with disabilitiesBecoming RentABLE was founded by Lorraine Woodward after years of frustration in trying to find accessible short-term rental properties for her family's vacations. Through the years, Lorraine has seen a real need for an accessible property each time she talked to her renters, many of whom haven't had the ability to vacation, due to lack of access, until they found her accessible rental. Lorraine and co-founder Jennifer Springer aim to improve accessibility in the rental property market, looking beyond the wheelchair toward a broader range of accessibility accommodations.Be My Eyes is a mobile app that connects people with sight impairments to volunteers through live video. After noticing that people who are blind would often video call family members for help in solving what seems like everyday tasks, Be My Eyes was founded to create a video-calling platform for the visually impaired that is staffed by a network of volunteers so that they don't have to solely rely on family and friends. Since the company launched in January 2015, over six million volunteers have signed up to assist blind and low-vision users.Handiscover was founded by Sebastien Archambeaud after his son became a wheelchair user, and he was challenged to find accessible accommodations for their vacations. Leaning into his background in technology, Archambeaud built Handiscover, an accommodation booking website for travelers to search and select accommodations based on their mobility needs.iAccess Life is a mobile app that allows travelers to rate and review locations such as restaurants, hotels and other attractions based on various aspects of their accessibility needs. Founded by Brandon Winfield and Sayeed Mehrjerdian, iAccess Life empowers travelers who are disabled to ""know before they go"" and feel confident planning trips to new locations.Sociability is a mobile app that helps people who are disabled find accessible locations. After relocating to Oxford in the United Kingdom from Australia, Matt Pierri noticed the lack of centralized accessibility information and created an app that allows the community to find, tag and share accessible places so that others can enjoy them too.Wheel The World is an online resource for accessible travel experiences, empowering travelers with disabilities and seniors to explore the world without limits. After his experience trekking Patagonia in a wheelchair, Alvaro Silberstein was inspired to found Wheel the World alongside Camilo Navarro, enabling everyone to travel the world - regardless of ability.Story continuesAdvancing travel equityFlywallet is a digital wallet and savings account that makes booking travel more affordable, accessible and sustainable. Founded by Thomas Negrit and Alejandra Fernandez, Flywallet combines data, APIs, blockchain and Web3 to gamify budgeting and paying for travel, helping to reduce the financial burden and lower carbon emissions.Green Book Global is a platform for Black travelers to share destination reviews and ratings, book trips and earn cash for travel. Lawrence Phillips founded Green Book Global in 2018 to inspire and empower Black travelers to explore the world. It rates locations on the experience of ""Traveling While Black"" to help its community feel safe, and works with destinations to become more inclusive.Empowering women and LGBTQIA+ travelersGeoSure combines data from tourism and travel alerts, health, economic and crime statistics to provide hyper-local safety data for travelers, especially women and the LGBTQIA+ community. In 2014, Michael Becker and Dr. Don Pardew set out to make travel safer and more predictable by offering real-time data and analysis on destinations across the globe. GeoSure is now available in over 65,000 cities and neighborhoods worldwide.Greether is a travel safety platform that connects women travelers to local women guides so they can experience the destination's culture firsthand with peace of mind. An experienced solo traveler, Vanessa Karel founded Greether in 2021 after interviewing 500 other women travelers - 90% of whom identified safety as their primary concern.misterb&amp;b is an online platform where travelers can choose from over one million private rooms, apartments and LGBTQIA+-friendly hotels and connect with local guides. After experiencing homophobic discrimination during a private room stay, Matthieu Jost, CEO &amp; co-founder, started misterb&amp;b so that no travelers would feel unwelcome based on their sexual identity.SoloTrvlr is a travel app for women to explore over 100 destinations, through the eyes of women that know it best. Kim Callender founded SoloTrvlr in 2021 so that women can plan trips with the input and experience from local women and make solo women travel accessible and safe for all, regardless of age, race or sexuality.The passion and drive from these companies to create a more equitable travel experience for every traveler pushes the industry forward.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Expedia and Zalando are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXPE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ZLNDY has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.EXPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.89, while ZLNDY has a forward P/E of 86.43. We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 0.92. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ZLNDY currently has a PEG ratio of 5.69.Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P/B ratio of 4.99. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ZLNDY has a P/B of 6.09.These metrics, and several others, help EXPE earn a Value grade of B, while ZLNDY has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesEXPE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ZLNDY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EXPE is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, CDW noted that both professional and managed services posted double-digit growth. The company’s widespread footprint, which includes its presence in the United States, U.K. and Canada, is likely to have acted as a tailwind.CDW is also working to improve its capabilities to attract new customers. The fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from increasing Healthcare and Government customers and increased revenues from federal customers.CDW's approach of encouraging organic growth and pursuing buyouts is likely to have raised the company's profile. Buyouts like Amplified IT and Focal Point Data Risk have helped to improve its educational and security capabilities, respectively.Global macroeconomic weakness, forex volatility, global supply-chain glitches and component shortages might have dented the to-be-reported quarter’s performance. Rising inflation is likely to have led to increasing expenses, which is expected to weigh on the company’s profitability.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for CDW this time around.

184,f625d825-ed82-3632-aefd-35997c7ca65a,PHM,2023-02-07,"PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-trending-stock-140002095.html,1675692002,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +21.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +8.3% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 15.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.22 points to a change of -33.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.01 indicates a change of +11% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.44 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.65 billion and $15.3 billion estimates indicate -9.7% and +4.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%. The EPS surprise was +26.04%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

185,04dc5730-66b9-3a7a-8d85-12ec1c361996,BAX,2023-02-07,Quipt Home Medical Corp. (QIPT) to Report Q1 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quipt-home-medical-corp-qipt-150003770.html,1675695603,STORY,['BAX'],"[The market expects Quipt Home Medical Corp. (QIPT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +116.7%.Revenues are expected to be $42.27 million, up 43.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quipt Home Medical Corp.For Quipt Home Medical Corp.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quipt Home Medical Corp. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Quipt Home Medical Corp. Would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.05, delivering a surprise of +25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Quipt Home Medical Corp. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Baxter International (BAX), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -9.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.77 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Baxter has been revised 3.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.28%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Quite a few are scheduled to report later in the week. Bellwether Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Swiss pharma giant Novartis beat on earnings but missed on revenues. Among the biotechs, Amgen and Bristol Myers beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Regeneron delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though lead drug Eylea sales declined. Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD too beat on both earnings and sales on continued solid demand for its HIV portfolio and oncology franchise, driven by the cell therapy franchise and Trodelvy.Per the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry comes under the broader Medical sector, which comprises pharma/biotech as well as medical device companies.Per the Earnings Trends report, as of Feb 1, 28.6% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting nearly 51.1% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings. While 81.3% beat earnings estimates, 62.5% beat the same for sales. Earnings increased 3.6% year over year on 7.6% higher revenues. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the Medical sector are expected to decline 9% on a 4.3% sales increase.Let’s analyze three drug/biotech companies — Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, Incyte INCY and Exelixis EXEL — that are set to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 7.Vertex PharmaceuticalsVertex has a pretty impressive track record having beaten earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Trikafta sales are pegged at $2.04 billion and $1.99 billion, respectively.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including ConocoPhillips (COP), Medtronic plc (MDT) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;ConocoPhillips’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - U.S. industry over the past six months (+15.5% vs. +13.5%). The company holds bulk acreages in the unconventional plays of Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale. Significant opportunities are there for the firm in the Bakken Shale, where it owns about 750 undrilled locations that could provide access to huge reserves.COP projects its 2022 production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d), suggesting an increase from 1.6 MMBoe/d last year. COP’s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Also, it approved a $20-billion increase in the existing share repurchase program to $45 billion.However, COP is highly exposed to oil price fluctuations, which makes things challenging for the company. Also, it been generating lower dividend yields than the industry over the past few years. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on ConocoPhillips here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Medtronic have declined -14.6% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s decline of -35.2%. The company’s innovations and market expansion efforts are helping it offset the impact of the high inflation and supply disruptions. The Zacks analyst believes in fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings are expected to grow 1.5% on 2.9% growth in revenues.However, Medtronic is strategically expanding its global presence to address the unmet demand for advanced medical technologies. We expect Medtronic to register an international sales CAGR of 1.5% through 2025. Within cardiovascular, Medtronic is gaining market share, banking on product launches. Within MedSurg, Medtronic is scaling production of Hugo RAS.Medtronic’s strong liquidity position should allow it to meet its near-term debt obligations. All these factors support our bullish stance on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Medtronic here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PayPal have declined -29.5% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of -31.0%. The company trimmed its guidance for revenue growth in anticipation of an economic downturn, which might slow down consumer spending. Further, intensifying market competition and foreign exchange headwinds remain risks.However, PayPal is benefiting from growing total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement on the company’s platform is a major positive. Further, Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth.Solid momentum across core peer to peer, merchant services, PayPal Checkout experiences remains a tailwind. We believe accelerating transaction revenues of PayPal are likely to continue driving revenues. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect net revenues in 2022 to rise 8.4% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on PayPal here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Mondelez International, Inc.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing at Boeing.The restructure is part of Boeing’s plan to focus its resources on engineering and manufacturing as it struggles to keep up with deliveries of planes.The manufacturer has repeatedly failed to hit delivery deadlines as the tragic crashes of two of the planes in 2018 and 2019 casts a long shadow over operations.Although the 737 Max jets have now been signed off as safe by regulators, Boeing has been hit by supply chain problems and production delays.Boeing said it will increase its overall workforce size by 10,000 this year, with a “focus on engineering and manufacturing”. Headcount swelled by 15,000 last year.Airlines are keen to acquire Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft as it will cut carriers’ fuel costs and reduce emissions.The Seattle Times reported that Tata Consulting Services in Bengaluru, India would take responsibility for some of the head office functions being outsourced.]"

The U.N. agency is expected to begin studying the issue early this year.Boiardi said only the most advanced planes, equipped for a higher level of safety than required by minimum certification standards, could be used for solo flying in cruise. They would include Airbus A350s and potentially Boeing 787s and 777Xs.EASA was seeking input on the matter from airlines and pilots in a process expected to wrap up in March, Boiardi said in the first in-depth interview EASA has given on the subject.Story continuesThe less ambitious proposal for solo operation in cruise, which would not start before 2027, would initially target improved pilot rest during regular flights, he said. A fatigued aviator could plan to sleep in a bunk rather than take short unplanned naps on the flight deck.If the safety were proven, eventually long-haul crews that now required three or four pilots could be reduced to two, with both in the cockpit for take-off and landing, Boiardi added.Even limited solo flying, however, is dividing airlines and raising public fears, while sparking a growing backlash among pilot groups like the European Cockpit Association.""The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transport Canada are very much aware of our position that two pilots on the flight deck is the most safe,"" said Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) Canada president Tim Perry.The FAA declined to comment. Transport Canada said it would ""monitor developments.""While Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways has talked with manufacturers about reduced-crew operations, Air France chief executive Anne Rigail told Reuters single-pilot operations were not a priority.An industry source familiar with Airbus's project said an A350 used for single-pilot flight in cruise would feature extra automated protections against such threats as fire and engine failure and maintain autopilot functions in more circumstances than today.Airbus said in a statement it was studying the concept of a single pilot in the cruise phase but not wholly single-pilot flights. Dassault did not respond to requests for comment, while Boeing deferred questions to regulators.Boiardi said the concepts under review did not differentiate between cargo and passenger flights. Consumer resistance, however, could result in single-pilot flying starting with cargo flights, industry officials said.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Mid-America Apartment Communities in FocusBased in Germantown, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 10.23%. Currently paying a dividend of $1.4 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.24%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield is 3.52%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.58%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $5.60 is up 19.8% from last year. Mid-America Apartment Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.45%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Mid-America Apartment Communities's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MAA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $9.18 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MAA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&amp;A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.Ralph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2023. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in our cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.Story continuesBefore turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $17 million or $0.06 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $56 million or $0.18 per share for costs associated with the sale of businesses. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.With that, I'll turn the call over to David.David Cordani: Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. 2022 was a pivotal year of performance and growth for our company. Evernorth further expanded its health service reach and impact, and Cigna Healthcare demonstrated tremendous resilience in the dynamic market. Together, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and earnings outlook and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. This provides us with momentum as we begin 2023 and we expect another year of customer and earnings growth as we innovate and expand our broad portfolio of services and capabilities. Today, I'll provide perspective about our key drivers for our 2022 performance and how we're positioned for sustained growth going forward.Then Brian will walk through additional details about our 2022 financial results and discuss our '23 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. So let's jump in. As we reflect on our performance for 2022, I'm proud of what the company and Cigna team delivered overall. We grew full year revenues to approximately $181 billion. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $23.27 reflecting a 14% rate of growth. We returned $9 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, and we sharpened the health service focus of our international business through the divestiture of our life accident and supplemental benefits businesses across seven markets. This performance demonstrates how well our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are strategically positioned for sustained attractive growth.In 2022, Evernorth delivered strong top and bottom line growth and also won, renewed and expanded several large multiyear client relationships for 2023 and beyond. The depth of Evernorth's capabilities and expertise is highly valued by our clients and partners and enables us to deepen existing relationships across our entire portfolio of businesses. Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform also had a strong year, delivering customer growth along with differentiated medical cost performance for the benefit of our customers and clients. Our U.S. Commercial business had a standout performance achieving outsized customer growth while maintaining pricing discipline and driving margin improvement. This reflects our ability of our Commercial team to work consultatively to help employers of all sizes manage affordability, all while we support healthy, highly engaged employees for the benefit of their businesses.Overall, we're pleased with the strength of our 2022 performance across our enterprise. As we look to 2023, we continue to deliver and capture meaningful value in multiple ways. First, we expect sustained growth through our foundational businesses, Pharmacy Benefit Services, U.S. Commercial and International Health. These are mature scaled businesses that have established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental agencies. The value proposition for these businesses continues to resonate very well in the marketplace. In Pharmacy Benefit Services, we expect continued contributions in 2023 through the strength of our unique solutions and partnership orientation. With the strong selling season across our employer, health plan and governmental agency portfolio, we will continue delivering greater affordability to more customers and patients.Additionally, we are investing meaningfully to put in place the teams and resources to make prescriptions more accessible and affordable for approximately 20 million Centene customers starting in 2024. In the U.S. Commercial business, we also had a strong 2023 selling season across all our market segments and across all funding types, self-funded risk and shared return arrangements. As a result, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth. And in International Health, we expect continued revenue and earnings contributions through our leadership in meeting the health and wellbeing needs in attractive growth markets and for the globally mobile. Second, we expect outsized growth from our accelerated businesses, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and U.S. government.These businesses have differentiated capabilities and platforms addressing accelerated secular growth trends. With Accredo, we were able to lower cost for patients and plans while preserving choice and flexibility for those who could benefit from new drugs. This includes our work to increase the availability of biosimilars. We've seen a handful of these lower-cost alternatives for biologic drugs launched in the past few years and understand the exceptional value they deliver for the benefit of clients and customers. 2023 will mark the start of a growing market opportunity for biosimilars, a trend that we expect to continue ramping up in 2024 and beyond. This includes HUMIRA, a treatment for a range of inflammatory conditions and one of the top-selling drugs globally over the past decade.Now there's a biosimilar alternative that we've co-preferred on a national preferred formulary creating significant savings opportunities for clients and customers. We will continue our leadership in advocating for greater availability of biosimilars, which over time, we expect to drive even more savings and benefit for patients and clients. In Evernorth Care Services, we are continuing to enhance and expand our portfolio of capabilities in care management and care delivery. Last year, MDLIVE virtual patient visits grew meaningfully, including a substantial increase in primary care visits. Demand and satisfaction with virtual care is rising and we will continue expanding our MDLIVE platform to provide even more of these options for the benefit of our customers.Evernorth Care Services is also accelerating our value-based care capabilities through our recently announced partnership with VillageMD. Our wrapping Evernorth health service capabilities with VillageMD's network of physicians, we will help guide more patients to high-quality care experiences at lower overall total costs. We expect this partnership to begin rolling out over the course of this year. In the U.S. government, another accelerated business, we expect strong growth in 2023 as we expand services and our geographic presence across a large and growing addressable market. This includes Medicare Advantage, where we will introduce enhanced services and benefits, and we nearly doubled the size of our provider network over the last two years as we expand into new geographies.Additionally, as we have demonstrated continued consistent commitment to participating in the ACA exchange marketplace, in a dynamic environment, our Individual &amp; Family Plan business, we will see outsized customer growth in 2023. The third growth driver for us in 2023 and beyond is enterprise leverage. This is where our businesses work together to create or capture more value than anyone could achieve on their own. Here, think about our ability to look across our enterprise and client relationships to broaden and deepen them by leveraging our entire suite of capabilities. A great example is a new large service-based relationship for Cigna Healthcare where we were able to expand our support for a long-served Evernorth client. Additionally, the depth of clinical expertise success in advancing innovation and breadth of solutions within Evernorth, all combined to help further improve Cigna Healthcare's value proposition.For example, in 2022, by harnessing Evernorth's capabilities and programs, Cigna Healthcare delivered exceptional affordability, a key reason it continues to be competitively attractive option for employers of all sizes. This ability to deliver meaningful value is what makes Evernorth a partner of choice to a wide range of health plans, large employers and other clients. Another way we generate enterprise leverage is with our longitudinal portfolio data, which enables us to accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers. This is specifically how we developed our Pathwell programs where we're able to integrate Cigna Healthcare's high-performing provider networks and benefits management with Evernorth's analytical and clinical expertise as well as personalized digital support.This equips Pathwell to lower cost while connecting patients with the right care, anticipating their future needs and helping them recover more quickly. Pathwell's focus in 2023 includes musculoskeletal conditions and patients who take injectable or infusible biologic drugs. Early feedback here has been very positive, and we expect to support millions of patients throughout these programs with better experience, clinical quality, costs, resulting in improved overall value. These examples illustrate just some of the impact we've already achieved with our cross-enterprise leverage, and we'll continue acting on additional opportunities in the years ahead to expand relationships, accelerate innovation for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients.Health, Care, LifePhoto by Online Marketing on UnsplashNow I'll briefly summarize. 2022 was a strong year of performance and growth for our company. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, and our durable growth framework, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers, clients and partners as we look to the future. We are delivering on our commitments to our shareholders with our 2022 adjusted EPS of $23.27 and returning $9 billion in share repurchase and dividends. And we are also responding to evolving needs of those we serve in the coming years in the Healthcare environment of accelerated change. We have a differentiated innovation pipeline that will allow us to build on our momentum and create value, continue to advance our growth strategy. We are confident 2023 will be another year of strong performance for our company as we expect to deliver customer and earnings growth.Our EPS outlook of at least $24.60 and the 10% increase of our quarterly dividend reinforced our commitment to sustained impact and growth for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.Brian Evanko: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2023. We're very pleased with our strong performance in 2022, reflecting focused execution and growth across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, with each segment achieving pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line or above our long-term targets. This positions us well for continued growth in 2023. Looking at full year 2022 specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of approximately $181 billion, and adjusted earnings of $7.3 billion after tax or $23.27 per share, reflecting 14% growth from 2021. This is above the high end of our 10% to 13% long-term average adjusted EPS growth target.Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2022 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth, as our innovation, market-leading clinical capabilities and proven track record of delivering for clients and customers continue to resonate in the market. Turning specifically to fourth quarter results for Evernorth, revenues grew to $36.2 billion, while pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 6% over fourth quarter 2021 to $1.7 billion. Similar to the first three quarters of 2022, Evernorth's strong results in the fourth quarter were driven by continued expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our specialty pharmacy as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers.We also continued to make meaningful strategic investments, which serve to strengthen our client relationships, expand our services portfolio and advance our digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers and expanding our partnerships and relationships, all while achieving strong revenue and pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our recently announced collaboration with Centene that begins in 2024 as well as other large multiyear contracts we renewed for 2023 further demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and proven partnership orientation in the market, providing long-term opportunities to grow while driving lower costs for our clients.Turning to Cigna Healthcare. As we entered 2022, we shared with all of you our goals of both growing our customer base and expanding margins. I'm pleased to report we ended the year accomplishing both of these goals, as we grew our medical customer base by 5% or 923,000 lives to 18 million total customers, while improving full year pre-tax adjusted margins to 9%, a year-over-year improvement of 90 basis points. Fourth quarter 2022 performance contributed to full year results with adjusted revenues of $11.1 billion, pre-tax adjusted earnings of $500 million and a medical care ratio of 84%. Despite an elevated flu and RSV season, our medical care ratio was slightly better than our expectations, particularly within our stop-loss products. Our medical care ratio for full year 2022 of 81.7% improved 230 basis points compared to the prior year.Both full year and fourth quarter results benefited from pricing discipline and affordability initiatives, including our clinical programs. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered for our customers, clients and partners, all while driving a strong year of customer growth and margin expansion with full year pre-tax adjusted earnings growth of 13%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range of 8% to 10%. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $382 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, Cigna's 2022 results were strong, reflecting focused execution for the benefit of our clients and customers.As we turn to 2023, we continue to expect underlying growth in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to make strategic investments to drive future growth. For the full year 2023 outlook, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $187 billion. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.33 billion or at least $24.60 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary on our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you this outlook includes a headwind from costs we will incur in 2023 to prepare for serving Centene's customers. This contract starts on January 1, 2024, and we look forward to many years of partnership and collaboration as we drive affordability for their customers.Additionally, with regards to earnings seasonality, we would expect a different cadence this year when compared to historical patterns, with earnings more back half weighted, in first quarter representing slightly above 20% of the full year EPS. For full year 2023, we project an adjusted SG&amp;A expense ratio of approximately 7.3%. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 21% to 21.5%. I'll now discuss our 2023 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. Tailwinds and headwinds are largely consistent with the points we highlighted on our third quarter earnings call. These include tailwinds from a strong selling season and value creation from the increased availability of biosimilars, building in the second half of 2023 and ramping in 2024 and beyond.These are partly offset by headwinds from additional costs to support future growth, including implementation costs associated with onboarding Centene prior to receiving revenue, strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses and the expansion of our relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. In consideration of these tailwinds and headwinds, we expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to be weighted more towards the back half of the year, with low single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first half, followed by mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the second half. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.4 billion, representing growth of at least 8% year-over-year.We expect 2023 Cigna Healthcare earnings to be split closer to 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing. Key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2023 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2023 growth of at least 1.2 million customers, with growth across each of our U.S. Commercial, Medicare Advantage and individual businesses. Within U.S. Commercial, we expect organic customer growth across each of our national, middle market and select market segments. And similar to 2022, the growth will primarily reflect fee-based customers.We expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of at least high single digits, and we expect growth in our U.S. individual business of at least 300,000 customers, driven by geographic expansion, strong industry growth and the exit of competitors from certain geographies. We expect the 2023 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5% in part reflecting an increased mix of government business, which tends to have a higher medical care ratio compared to U.S. Commercial and International Health. Additionally, we would expect the first quarter 2023 medical care ratio to be within the full year guidance range. As it relates to Corporate and Other Operations, this segment has evolved given the divestiture of a portion of our international business last year that had been a positive earnings contributor in the first half of 2022.As a result, we expect the full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted loss to more closely reflect annualized fourth quarter 2022 results. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. In 2022, we finished the year strong and delivered $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We returned $9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2022. Specific to share buyback, we repurchased 27.4 million shares for $7.6 billion. Additionally, our debt-to-cap ratio finished the year at 40.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points from year-end 2021. Now, framing our capital outlook for 2023. We expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our enterprise. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities.We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures. These investments will include substantial commitments to our accelerated growth platforms of specialty pharmacy, Evernorth Care, and U.S. government. We expect to deploy approximately $1.45 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend of $1.23 per share, up 10% from 2022 on a per share basis. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2023, we have repurchased 1.6 million shares for $510 million. And our guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares to be in the range of 296 million to 300 million shares. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.And now to recap. Our full year 2022 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2023 outlook reflects continued momentum across our segments as we invest to support long-term attractive growth. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 full year adjusted earnings of at least $24.60 per share. And we continue to expect to deliver 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.See also 20 Least Populated States in America and 10 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This compares to earnings of $3.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $2.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.02, delivering a surprise of 3.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Skyworks , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry, posted revenues of $1.33 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.94%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.51 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Skyworks shares have added about 23.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Skyworks?While Skyworks has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Skyworks: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.18 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.54 on $4.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductors - Radio Frequency is currently in the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, TransAct Technologies Incorporated (TACT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +84.2%.

As set forth in the ""Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table found above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods, compare our operating performance against peer companies, and determine payments under certain compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-recurring expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make forecasts.We provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We also believe that providing non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows investors to assess the extent to which our ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. We further believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share allows investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain tax items which may not occur in each period presented and which may represent non-cash items unrelated to our ongoing operations. We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures.We calculate non-GAAP gross profit by excluding from GAAP gross profit, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We calculate non-GAAP operating income by excluding from GAAP operating income, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and restructuring-related charges. We calculate non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share by excluding from GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain tax items. We exclude the items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below:Share-Based Compensation Expense - because (1) the total amount of expense is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred, (2) it is an expense based upon a valuation methodology premised on assumptions that vary over time, and (3) the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies due to factors that can be outside of the control of such companies.Acquisition-Related Expenses and Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles - including such items as, when applicable, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.Settlements, Gains, Losses, and Impairments - because such settlements, gains, losses, and impairments (1) are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) are infrequent in nature, (3) are generally not directly controlled by management, (4) do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized, and/or (5) can vary significantly in amount between companies and make comparisons less reliable.Restructuring and Other Charges - because these charges have no direct correlation to our future business operations and including such charges or reversals does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.Certain Income Tax Items - including certain deferred tax charges and benefits that do not result in a current tax payment or tax refund and other adjustments, including but not limited to, items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a result of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.Our earnings release contains forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of our 2023 fiscal year (""Q2 2023""). We provide this non-GAAP measure to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide it to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking estimate of Q2 2023 GAAP diluted earnings per share to a forward-looking estimate of Q2 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 2023 (other than estimated share-based compensation expense of $0.25 to $0.35 per diluted share, estimated amortization of intangibles of $0.35 to $0.45 per diluted share and certain tax items of -$0.15 to -$0.05 per diluted share) is difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles, or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. The probable significance of these unknown items, in the aggregate, is estimated to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.15 in quarterly earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.[a]The following table summarizes the expense recognized in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation, Stock Compensation (in millions):Three Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Cost of goods sold$2.6$8.7Research and development27.918.8Selling, general, and administrative18.922.9Total share-based compensation$49.4$50.4SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC.UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAs of(in millions)December 30, 2022September 30, 2022AssetsCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$992.6$586.8Accounts receivable, net764.11,094.0Inventory1,273.31,212.1Property, plant, and equipment, net1,562.71,604.8Goodwill and intangible assets, net3,549.73,621.4Other assets805.0754.7Total assets$8,947.4$8,873.8Liabilities and EquityAccounts payable$180.3$274.2Accrued and other liabilities1,027.4941.5Debt2,189.82,189.1Stockholders’ equity5,549.95,469.0Total liabilities and equity$8,947.4$8,873.8SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWSThree Months Ended(in millions)December 30, 2022December 31, 2021Cash flow from operating activitiesNet income$309.4$399.9Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Share-based compensation49.450.4Depreciation99.494.2Amortization of intangible assets, including inventory step-up72.087.3Deferred income taxes(29.9)6.1Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs0.71.0Other, net—1.0Changes in assets and liabilities:Receivables, net329.9(17.8)Inventory(55.8)35.5Accounts payable(87.8)(0.5)Other current and long-term assets and liabilities86.1(75.4)Net cash provided by operating activities773.4581.7Cash flow from investing activitiesCapital expenditures(63.5)(95.8)Purchased intangibles(7.8)(5.8)Purchases of marketable securities(163.1)(29.6)Sales and maturities of marketable securities11.333.2Net cash used in investing activities(223.1)(98.0)Cash flow from financing activitiesRepurchase of common stock — payroll tax withholdings on equity awards(31.9)(80.1)Repurchase of common stock — stock repurchase program(166.2)(269.4)Dividends paid(99.4)(92.5)Net proceeds from exercise of stock options1.11.8Payments of debt—(50.0)Net cash used in financing activities(296.4)(490.2)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents253.9(6.5)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period566.0882.9Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$819.9$876.4View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230206005226/en/ContactsMedia Relations: Constance Griffiths(949) 231-4207Investor Relations:Mitch Haws(949) 231-3223]"

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.1%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.67%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the athletic apparel maker had gained 2.47% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 16.21% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.32% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nike as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.51, down 41.38% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $11.37 billion, up 4.56% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $49.98 billion. These totals would mark changes of -17.07% and +6.99%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Nike currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).In terms of valuation, Nike is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 41.04. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.57, which means Nike is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesWe can also see that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 4.28.

(Mark Lennihan / Associated Press)Content warning: This story includes descriptions of sexual assault.A former Wells Fargo executive alleged that she was raped by a superior while on a work trip and said the bank created a hostile work environment, failed to protect her from sexual harassment and retaliated against her, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The lawsuit filed Thursday describes an escalating pattern of sexually harassing comments, groping and assault by Eric R. Pagel, a senior investment strategist and managing director at Wells Fargo, that began soon after the plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, was hired in April 2018 as a senior vice president and wealth advisor.Pagel raped Doe in a Bakersfield hotel room in January 2020 while she was intoxicated, according to the complaint.According to the suit, Pagel groped Doe twice and subjected her to inappropriate comments in the two years prior to the alleged rape, but Doe kept quiet because she feared complaining would damage her career. Then, in February 2020, a few weeks after the alleged rape, she complained to her immediate boss about comments Pagel had made, but was brushed off.Doe filed a formal complaint with the company about the rape in November 2020, but ""no meaningful investigation ensued,"" the suit said. ""Rather, Plaintiff was subjected to adverse actions regarding her employment.""Wells Fargo spokesperson Laurie W. Kight declined to comment on the complaint's allegations.""We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and are reviewing the lawsuit,"" Kight said in an email.Pagel declined to comment, referring a reporter to Wells Fargo.Doe, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in an interview that as her case dragged on without resolution, she increasingly felt she couldn't trust the company. She said work became unbearable, and she would cry multiple times a day.""I was being gaslighted by Wells Fargo,"" Doe said. ""It was a huge betrayal.""Pagel would often remark on Doe's appearance and made demeaning comments about other women, according to the lawsuit.Story continuesHe made sexually explicit comments, repeatedly suggesting Doe should exchange sex for money, and he said Doe should divorce her husband and sleep with a wealthy client's son, according to the complaint.Pagel regularly invited Doe to drinks alone. He also often invited her to visit his second home in Lake Tahoe without their families — requests that Doe declined, the lawsuit said.Pagel groped Doe at a business event in Beverly Hills on Oct. 15, 2018, and again on Jan. 29, 2019, at a company event hosted for clients at a hotel, the lawsuit said. Doe pushed Pagel's hand away in both instances.On Jan. 28, 2020, a team of six Wells Fargo employees including Doe and Pagel drove to the Padre Hotel in Bakersfield to meet with several high-net-worth clients. The group met for drinks in the hotel lobby, then went to dinner around 7 p.m.During dinner, while Doe and a female colleague stepped away to use the restroom, Pagel and three male colleagues allegedly took inappropriate pictures of themselves on Doe's phone, the suit said.After more drinks at a bar, where Doe became increasingly intoxicated, the group returned to the hotel.The next morning, Doe's memory of the previous evening was fragmented and unclear. Piecing her recollections together, she recalled receiving a knock on her door; when she opened it, Pagel ""barged in,"" began kissing her and raped her, according to the complaint. On Jan. 31, she confronted Pagel, the lawsuit said, and he told her they had had sex multiple times without contraceptives.In early February, Doe called her gynecologist to inquire about testing her systems for drugs and administering a rape kit. Her doctor informed her that too much time had passed for tests to be effective. Doe was embarrassed and hesitant to report the incident through formal channels, she said in the complaint.Pagel allegedly continued to make inappropriate comments, telling Doe later that month she should be paired with a wealthy client because that client was having a sexual relationship with his secretary and would also find Doe attractive, the lawsuit said.On Feb. 27, she told her immediate supervisor that she was uncomfortable with comments Pagel had made. The supervisor brushed off her concerns, the lawsuit said, suggesting she should not give Pagel a “window of opportunity” to be inappropriate.Doe, in the following months, ""became emotionally distressed to the point of paralysis"" with the thought of her sexual assault and the ""cavalier attitude"" of her direct supervisor, the lawsuit said.The lawsuit alleges Doe experienced retaliation — that clients of hers were reassigned without her knowledge, she was removed from important communications and her superiors threatened to exclude her from high-profile accounts.On Nov. 13, 2020, more than eight months after the alleged rape, Doe filed a formal report with the company's ethics hotline. Doe filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's station in Lomita the same day.The company for months did not take action to investigate the incident, neglecting to collect a statement from Doe or ask for names of witnesses until April 2021, after Doe made a formal charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the lawsuit said. Doe went on medical leave that month for anxiety and depression, and the company began collecting her statement during that period.The company's investigation dragged on, and Doe was asked to engage in an ""interactive dialogue,"" the suit said.Doe ultimately resigned from the bank in July 2021.Doe and her attorney, Ronald Zambrano of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said detectives did not make headway in their investigation and declined to pursue criminal charges against Pagel.On Oct. 21, 2021, Doe received an emailed message from the Wells Fargo ethics line informing her the case she'd filed had been closed; it did not reveal the company's determination or other specifics.""If appropriate, corrective actions have been or will be taken in accordance with Wells Fargo policy,"" the note said, according to a screenshot reviewed by The Times.Kight, the Wells Fargo spokesperson, did not respond to questions about whether Pagel was still employed at the company.The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and monetary relief for unspecified general, consequential and special damages including losses in earnings, physical injuries and illness, emotional distress, medical expenses and attorney fees. The complaint also seeks punitive damages from Wells Fargo for failing to prevent harmful conduct and from named defendants for acting wrongfully or maliciously.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

According to the IRS, “You must report all gambling winnings,” even for sports bets. That itself is not necessarily new information to many who engage in the pastime. Any earnings must be reported on Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR.See: Top Tips for Painless Tax PrepFind: 3 Ways Smart People Save Money When Filing Their TaxesBut what may not be as well known is that the methods many utilize to pay for fantasy sports betting (and receive winnings) could now wind up under intense IRS scrutiny. So before you place those Super Bowl bets this week, you might want to know what’s at stake.It all hinges on the new threshold reporting for third-party settlement organization (TPSO) transactions. As GOBankingRates previously reported, the American Rescue Plan of 2021 requires anyone dealing with more than $600 in business transactions involving Venmo, PayPal and other third-party payment systems to report those on their returns (beginning in tax year 2023).The reporting threshold is currently $20,000 for 200-plus transactions but will soon be reduced to $600 on any number of transactions in 2023.Per Fox News, fantasy sports betting platforms like FanDuel or DraftKings allow options like Venmo and PayPal to facilitate bets and payouts, so if you bet (win or lose) more than $600 on the third-party app, you can expect to get a 1099-K form next year. Gambling losses can only be deducted by those engaging in an itemized deduction (and who keep all receipts), further threatening many taxpayers who prefer the standard deduction.These changes not only pertain to fantasy sports betting, but selling event tickets — or any transactions on TPSOs.It’s important to know how to ensure you’re not getting taxed twice (in the case of a sports betting payout), or on money that is not taxable / business income (i.e. if your friend sent you $25 for your birthday).Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Much of a Tax Refund Do You Expect in 2023?More: Here’s How Long You Should Hold Onto Tax Filing Paperwork, According to an ExpertKeep copious records: You’ll want to keep a log of transactions that happen through Venmo, PayPal or other third-party apps to denote what is considered “income” (such as betting earnings or tips if you use the platforms for personal services) and what is considered a gift or nontaxable transactions.Save wager receipts: This is important if you have losses on your bets — receipts can help deduct from your earnings to bring down your taxable amount.Use Zelle or checks: Per Fox News, Zelle currently doesn’t fall under TPSO guidelines, and the safest option, overall, is to utilize checks.More From GOBankingRates8 Places in California Where Home Prices Have PlummetedFood Stamps: What Is the Highest Income Level for SNAP Payments in February?The 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20238 Steps To Improve Your Finances in One YearThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The IRS May Tax You More in 2023 If You Play Fantasy Sports — Here’s What To Know]"

Also, with the Most Accurate Consensus at $1.21 per share, this indicates that PayPal could beat bottom-line expectations by 1.61%. On the top line, Q4 sales are forecasted to be $7.39 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverall, PayPal earnings are now expected to dip -11% to round out FY22 but rebound and climb 17% in FY23 at $4.77 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have slightly gone up for FY22 but have moderately declined for FY23 over the last quarter. Sales are forecasted to be up 8% for FY22 and rise another 8% in FY23 to $29.66 billion. Story continuesMore impressive, Fiscal 2023 sales would represent 92% growth over the last five years with 2018 sales at $15.45 billion. This shows that PayPal is still expanding despite increasing competition from Alphabet, Apple, and Block although PYPL’s growth rate is much slower than in the past.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation &amp; Historical PerformanceOver the last year, PayPal stock is still down -32% to trail Apple’s -11%, Blocks -20%, and Alphabet’s -26%, and only Apple has outpaced the Nasdaq’s -15% with the majority of tech stocks trailing the S&amp;P 500’s -9%. In the last decade, PayPal’s +123% also lags its closest payment solution competitors as well as the Nasdaq and Benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, after last year’s drop PayPal’s valuation indicates PYPL stock could have a considerable amount of upside. At around $82 per share, PYPL trades at 22.4X forward earnings which is 74% below its decade high of 87.8X and a 49% discount to the median of 44.1X. Plus, this is well below the Internet Software Industry average of 58.3X and closer to the broader S&amp;P 500’s 18.9X. TakeawayAlthough there is increasing competition from other payment solution providers, PayPal still controls the majority of the market and this alone could lead to more upside in the stock as reflected in the company’s solid top-line growth.With the broader technology sector as a whole still dealing with economic headwinds in correlation with higher inflation and operating costs, PYPL stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the guidance the company provides in its fourth-quarter report will be crucial to further upside in the stock.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including ConocoPhillips (COP), Medtronic plc (MDT) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;ConocoPhillips’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - U.S. industry over the past six months (+15.5% vs. +13.5%). The company holds bulk acreages in the unconventional plays of Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale. Significant opportunities are there for the firm in the Bakken Shale, where it owns about 750 undrilled locations that could provide access to huge reserves.COP projects its 2022 production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d), suggesting an increase from 1.6 MMBoe/d last year. COP’s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Also, it approved a $20-billion increase in the existing share repurchase program to $45 billion.However, COP is highly exposed to oil price fluctuations, which makes things challenging for the company. Also, it been generating lower dividend yields than the industry over the past few years. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on ConocoPhillips here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Medtronic have declined -14.6% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s decline of -35.2%. The company’s innovations and market expansion efforts are helping it offset the impact of the high inflation and supply disruptions. The Zacks analyst believes in fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings are expected to grow 1.5% on 2.9% growth in revenues.However, Medtronic is strategically expanding its global presence to address the unmet demand for advanced medical technologies. We expect Medtronic to register an international sales CAGR of 1.5% through 2025. Within cardiovascular, Medtronic is gaining market share, banking on product launches. Within MedSurg, Medtronic is scaling production of Hugo RAS.Medtronic’s strong liquidity position should allow it to meet its near-term debt obligations. All these factors support our bullish stance on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Medtronic here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PayPal have declined -29.5% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s decline of -31.0%. The company trimmed its guidance for revenue growth in anticipation of an economic downturn, which might slow down consumer spending. Further, intensifying market competition and foreign exchange headwinds remain risks.However, PayPal is benefiting from growing total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement on the company’s platform is a major positive. Further, Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth.Solid momentum across core peer to peer, merchant services, PayPal Checkout experiences remains a tailwind. We believe accelerating transaction revenues of PayPal are likely to continue driving revenues. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect net revenues in 2022 to rise 8.4% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on PayPal here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Mondelez International, Inc.

Secure your seat todayMetaco, a provider of crypto custody technology, has hired former-IBM digital asset specialist Peter DeMeo and made several other key appointments as the company shrugs off tough market conditions and prepares to drive the next phase of big-business crypto adoption.Reliable safekeeping of crypto assets is where the rubber has met the road for banks and institutions over the past couple of years. Custody has shot to prominence again in the wake of the FTX crypto exchange collapse and the failures of crypto lending platforms Celsius Network and CoinDesk sister company Genesis, among others.DeMeo’s appointment as chief product officer matters because IBM, where he was head of digital assets infrastructure, has been quietly building out bank-grade digital assets custody and key management. (Big Blue was previously best known in the industry for its forays into supply chain applications of permissioned blockchains and the like.)However, Metaco’s gain isn’t necessarily IBM’s loss, as DeMeo explains, because the move cements an existing working relationship between the two companies.“It's really a win-win because IBM’s strongest partner in digital assets over the last several years has been Metaco, and now we have a real opportunity to collaborate and take things to the next level,” DeMeo said in an interview. “Metaco is agnostic and of course will be working with other cloud and hardware providers as well. So, it’s a mutually beneficial relationship, but not necessarily an exclusive relationship.”Metaco also took on former IBM lead architect, Angel Nunez Mencias, who joins as chief customer officer. Other hires include former Accenture executive Katrin Koller as head of advisory; former PayPal and Unbound Security exec Rebecca Aspler as head of product; and Citi alum Mei Li Powell as head of marketing.“Last year was very much about scaling the team and bringing on as much talent and seniority as we could,” CEO Adrien Treccani said in an interview. “We have tripled the size of the team and are still planning to double the size of the company this year. The hires are mainly between Europe, Southeast Asia and North America, but we do have more regions appearing with our growing user base of clients.”Story continuesTreccani and DeMeo also pointed to the newly formed research and development division, Metaco Labs. That will work on cutting edge developments to bring key sharding technology called multiparty computation (MPC) inside a hardware security module (HSM), a kind of physical computing and storage lockbox that big banks are familiar with.“We’re going to be running MPC in the safest place on earth: a hardware security module,” said DeMeo. “Typically, you would have keys being signed off in HSMs and stored in HSMs. Now, instead of single keys, HSM’s would create and store key shards, which means those shards would never come together to create a key outside the HSM.”This development is relevant to Metaco clients, who generally want to know whether they should opt for an MPC or an HSM solution, noted Treccani. In addition, the complexity of MPC leads many users toward the “absolute disaster” scenario, where all the key shards are stored in the same data center, he added.“Our clients are large banks and custodians and want to have full control over the key material. This makes MPC very complex for them to use, because it means they have to deploy different key shards in completely separate data centers,” Treccani said. “In practice, we know the market is going to converge on the best of both worlds; it’s about having the decentralization of MPC, and having the minimal attack surface of HSMs.”]"

MUSA announced fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $5.21, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.16. The underperformance could be attributed to lower-than-expected petroleum product sales.However, MUSA’s bottom line was significantly above the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $4.23 per share, backed by a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 30.6 cents per gallon, up 11.3% year over year.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.4 billion rose 12.6% year over year and brushed past the consensus mark by $47 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.Merchandise sales, at $989.4 million, rose 6.7% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $970 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4.3 billion, falling 1.8% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but up 13.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021.Murphy USA Inc.

Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution rose 20.1% year over year to $369.3 million due to margin expansion and higher volumes. Total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 30.6 cents per gallon, which improved more than 11% from the fourth quarter of 2021.Retail fuel contribution increased 19.6% year over year to $341.2 million as margins widened to 28.3 cents per gallon from 25.5 cents in the corresponding period of 2021. Retail gallons rose 7.8% from the year-ago period to 1,206.3 million in the quarter under review and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 5.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021 to 241.6 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.19 per gallon, up from $3.05 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 4.2% to $189 million on higher sales, which more than offset the fall in unit margins, from 19.6% a year ago to 19.15% in the fourth quarter of 2022. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 3.1% year over year, primarily on the back of 5.5% higher tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 4.4% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were up 5.4% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 4.7% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Dec 31, Murphy USA — which opened 13 new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,712 — had cash and cash equivalents of $60.5 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 73.7%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $239.5 million.GuidanceThe company projects 2023 fuel volume in a range of 240 to 245 thousand gallons on an APSM basis. Further, Murphy USA’s 2023 guidance includes up to 45 new stores and up to 30 raze-and-rebuilds, $795-$815 million in merchandise margin contribution, and $375-$425 million in capital expenditures.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.34. However, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $2.94 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins improved to $19.73 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $11.95. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $25.03 and $19.58 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $12.60 and $11, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $16.35 per barrel from $10.16 in the prior-year quarter. The West Coast witnessed an increase in margins from $15.80 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.77 in the December-end quarter of 2022.But another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.45 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.4 billion, surging from $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.At the end of 2022, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion. Valero’s fourth-quarter capital investment was $640 million. Of the total, $349 million was allotted for sustaining the business.Marathon Petroleum MPC, also a downstream biggie, reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 and compared with a profit of merely $1.30 per share in the year-ago period. MPC’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $849 million on capital programs (59% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $651 million in the year-ago period.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.Investors will also notice that MPC has a PEG ratio of 0.26. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's industry currently sports an average PEG of 0.50. MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.34, all within the past year.We should also highlight that MPC has a P/B ratio of 1.71. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. MPC's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.08. Over the past 12 months, MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.21, with a median of 1.56.Finally, investors will want to recognize that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.88. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.61. Over the past year, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 3.21, with a median of 3.80.Story continuesAnother great Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock you could consider is Par Pacific (PARR), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Par Pacific also has a P/B ratio of 2.91 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.08. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 9.70, as low as 1.81, with a median of 3.30.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Marathon Petroleum and Par Pacific are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, MPC and PARR sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Miller-Coors, that's the real matchup. For the first time in 30 years, Molson Coors is returning to the big game. The beverage company's high-stakes beer ad during Super Bowl LVII comes after rival AB InBev ends its alcohol advertising exclusivity during the game, which took effect back in the late '80s.Joining us now for what we can expect on Sunday and how fans can cash in are Sofia Colucci, global VP of Miller family of brands, and Marcelo Pascoa, global VP of Coors family of brands. Nice to have you guys together.Nice jacket there, Sofia. Let's start with you. It's not a no-brainer to advertise, even though the exclusivity is gone. It's $7 mil for 30 seconds. Why is this opportunity worth it for you?SOFIA COLUCCI: Well, and thank you for the compliment on the jacket. I think Marcelo is a little jealous that he doesn't have the massive branding that I have right now. [LAUGHS]But look, the Super Bowl is a massive beer-drinking occasion, and we've been waiting for over 30 years for this moment, and we've been pretty public about it. It took us less than a minute to decide to buy an ad once we heard that exclusivity was no longer.And we deliberately designed this in a way that not only excites our fans leading up to the game but it also has them engaged during those pivotal 30 seconds because they wouldn't have seen the ad before, and we really want to make it count.DAVE BRIGGS: Marcelo, why, to you, is it worth that type of ad expenditure?MARCELO PASCOA: Listen, you have to think about the entire program, right? Like, I think that if you're only focused on what you're doing during those 30 seconds, it's probably not really that worth it. But we have a full program that goes way beyond what is happening in the 30 seconds. Actually, the 30 seconds is going to be the climax of something that is going on very strongly right now.Story continuesSo we're asking all of our fans to go on DraftKings and try to predict every single element of the commercial that we're going to be running in the big game. So if you can build a program that is going to engage consumers and help sell a ton of beer, then it's definitely worth it, but it has to be beyond what is happening in those 30 seconds.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, two weeks of build up is what truly makes this, dare I say it, almost a bargain. Sofia, make your case. Why Miller over Coors?SOFIA COLUCCI: I mean, it's obvious. First of all, great taste, less filling. We are the original light beer. We are growing share in the total beer category. We have 16 NFL alliances. And look, we've got pretty great swag, as you can see.DAVE BRIGGS: I grew up in Colorado on the Coors Light. So I've got to ask you, Marcelo, why Coors?MARCELO PASCOA: Listen, to me, it's a no-brainer. And I appreciate Sofia's point, but first of all, the Coors master brand is celebrating in 2023 150 years. It's our 150th anniversary. What better present for a brand to celebrate 150 years than a spot in the big game?We are the biggest brand in the building. We're an iconic brand that can bring the kind of mountain-cold refreshment that people need when they are watching a game like this. So for me, the case is pretty obvious. It has to be Coors Light.DAVE BRIGGS: Sofia, curious about the partnership with DraftKings. Why was the moment right for that?SOFIA COLUCCI: Yeah, absolutely. We've had a partnership with DraftKings now for a number of years. They're wonderful partners. And look, we're seeing now too the idea of betting, gamification, it is massive right now. It's super popular. And people aren't just betting on sports. They're betting on who will win ""The Bachelor?""So it's just a really big thing in culture right now, and people are talking about this being the betting bowl and the beer bowl. And we are, you know, on trend and leading it on both fronts. So we're really proud about that.DAVE BRIGGS: Marcelo, the ongoing theory is that you guys are going to share the spotlight on Super Bowl Sunday. Your reaction?MARCELO PASCOA: Well, first of all, if you want to know what's going to happen, you should watch the spot during the game. There are certain elements of the spot that I don't really know. Even myself and Sofia, we don't even know what's actually going to happen. Like, our boss, the CMO, Michelle St. Jacques, she holds some of the answers that even Sofia and I don't have.So my recommendation to everyone, if you want to know what happens, tune in during the big game and see who is actually going to take it.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, well, you've piqued our curiosity. Thank you both Sofia Colucci, Marcelo Pascoa. We'll be watching indeed with a hundred million other Americans. Thank you both.]"

Motor has redesigned the EV customer journey to provide utilities with the tools they need to maximize electrification outcomes – both accelerating adoption and driving high enrollment in utilities' managed charging programs. When a utility hires Motor, its customers get an easy, low-commitment, and all-in-one experience that includes a car, home delivery, EV onboarding, charging installation, and utility program enrollment.Kristina Lund, President and CEO of AES Indiana and AES Ohio, said, ""Our partnership with Motor has contributed significantly to EV adoption in our market, with an increase of more than 20% in Motor's launch year in the Indianapolis area. Motor's seamless signup process enrolls more than 75% of eligible drivers into managed charging programs, an outcome that benefits all customers.""Building on Motor's successful entry in the U.S. utility market, the funding from this Series A investment round will accelerate its growth into new geographies, refine its digital EV adoption experience, and expand its industry partnerships.About Motor  Incubated out of AES, Motor partners with utilities to accelerate consumer adoption of electric vehicles.

244,1697f944-b281-324a-b3c7-2edf1e7c11cb,GM,2023-02-07,15 Least Developed Countries in Latin America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-least-developed-countries-latin-131846748.html,1675775926,STORY,"['IBM', 'GM', 'MMM']","[In this article, we take a look at the 15 least developed countries in Latin America. You can skip our detailed analysis of the Central and South American economic outlook and go directly to the 5 Least Developed Countries in Latin America.Latin America comprises South and Central America. It is an economically maturing region with varying levels of development in different countries.Economic Problems in Latin America The region suffers from structural economic problems that have kept economic growth low in the region despite high potential. For instance, informality is a huge problem with economies in Central and South America. In fact, it's so pervasive that 60% of the workers in the region work in the informal economy, as noted by the World Economic Forum. Informal companies tend to remain small and less productive relative to their formal counterparts. This comes down to informal companies’ lack of access to formal credit markets and investment capital, and limited access to formal contract enforcement mechanisms among other factors. Other issues include limited diversification of the economies, inefficient provision of credit and reliance on commodity exports, as well as poor state of infrastructure. All in all, Latin American countries have been unable to tap their full potential and benefit from globalization as much as other regions like Asia have. Deglobalization and Emerging Opportunities Deglobalization is largely being driven by the ongoing decoupling between the US and the Chinese economy. It was further accelerated in the wake of the supply-chains collapse during the pandemic, with countries increasingly starting to prefer resilient supply chains even if it means more cost.In this regard, the US is increasingly moving its supply chains to Latin America, especially Mexico. Even before the pandemic, the US was in the process of shifting its supply chains from China as part of the trade war. The Chinese exports to the US dropped by 17% in 2019, as the US shifted some of its outsourcing to other countries, with Mexico gaining 16% from China’s lost share, bringing Mexico’s total share in the overall US imports to 15%, the highest after China. Story continuesAnother indicator that shows pre-pandemic pressures to shift outsourcing from China to Mexico is the labor cost. Wages in China superseded Mexican wages during 2014-2015, as noted by professor of International Affairs, Dr. Noel Maurer.Latin America offers other reinforcing advantages as well, as the US moves ahead with the Executive Order 14057 - an initiative to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035 - which is set to exponentially increase the demand for electric vehicles. In this regard, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile - the ‘lithium triangle’- are sitting over half of the global lithium reserves, a critical ingredient for EV batteries. All these trends show a great outlook for Latin American economies in the coming years. However, problems with infrastructure and limited market reforms in these countries can prove to be challenging to overcome. A positive sign is that increasing number of US companies have been opening facilities in Latin American countries. Some of these include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Photo by Parker Hilton on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have defined the ‘least developed countries in Latin America’ as ones that have low human development and per-capita income, but a relatively big population size. For this purpose, we’ve excluded Latin American countries with population sizes below 1 million, as they’re insignificant from the standpoint of economic potential. For this list, we first picked Latin American countries with lowest values on the Human Development Index (HDI) as of 2021-22. We then picked Latin American countries with lowest GDPs per capita. We then assigned two rankings to each country; one based on their HDI and the other based on GDP per Capita in a descending order of low development. Finally, we ranked the countries on our list based on the averages of the two rankings.15. Dominican RepublicHDI Ranking: 22 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 13 Average Ranking: 17.5The Dominican Republic is located in the Caribbean. It is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, and there are several reasons for its impoverishment. These include high crime rate, low-quality education, unemployment, natural disasters, corruption and political instability.The Dominican Republic also suffers from environmental degradation, which has dented the country’s capacity in food production, with 15% of the country’s population in a serious food-insecurity crisis, since late 2022. The Dominican Republic has a GDP per Capita of $8,477 as of 202114. MexicoHDI Ranking: 19 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 15 Average Ranking: 17Mexico is located south of the United States. While it is certainly more developed than most of the other countries on the list, it still suffers from considerable underdevelopment, and has a GDP per Capita of $10,046 as of 2021.The factors contributing to this growth drag include the presence of cartels, corruption, income inequality, lack of access to quality education, as well as infrastructure that needs overhaul, given that the US is moving its supply chains closer to home. Mexico is ranked 53rd on the Logistics Performance Index. Other, deeper issues with the Mexican economy have had a hugely negative but silent effect. These comprise informality in the economy, poorly working credit markets and warped supply of non-traded inputs. However, Mexico has recently made reforms to address these problems in order to attract investment. Companies like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) have facilities operating in Mexico, with more and more companies moving in the country.13. PeruHDI Ranking: 20 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 11 Average Ranking: 15.5Peru is one of the least developed countries in Latin America, with a GDP per Capita of $6,622 as of 2021. Peru is plagued by many of the same problems as other underdeveloped Latin American economies. It is, in most part, reliant on commodity exports, with not enough diversification. Further, nearly half of its economy is informal, with estimates suggesting a figure of 42%, representing $279 billion of GDP in PPP terms. Other factors hindering development in Peru include lack of access to quality education, corruption, income inequality, poor healthcare, and lack of proper infrastructure, especially in rural areas. 12. BrazilHDI Ranking: 18 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 12 Average Ranking: 15Despite its huge GDP of $1.60 trillion, Brazil is one of the least developed countries in South America. There are a myriad of factors why this is the case. Brazil has a low productivity rate. Between 2003 and 2014, the country’s productivity per worker increased by only 21%, even as minimum and real wages grew by 68% and 38%, respectively, as shown by the World Bank.This discrepancy has been traced to excessive government regulation resulting in lack of private investment, as well as the tax system and problems with the infrastructure. The country has also seen a rise in unemployment, with the number rising from 7.6 million unemployed people in 2012, to 13.4 million in 2019. Other factors include Brazil’s struggle with fiscal discipline, land reforms and corruption. Despite Brazil’s situation, it has a huge economy and cheap labor costs in the country have been attracting companies like 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) among others.11. ColombiaHDI Ranking: 17 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 10 Average Ranking: 13.5Colombia has a GDP per Capita of $6,104 as of 2021, making it one of the least developed countries in the Americas. One of the biggest problems in the country is poverty, whose levels jumped to 42.5% in 2020 during the pandemic, as reported by Borgen Project.Colombia has also been mired in internal conflicts, and crime, with the country dominated by armed groups, resulting in it being one of the most dangerous countries in the world. It also suffers from a huge lack of infrastructure, with 81% of homes in Colombia’s rural areas having no access to piped water network. 10. EcuadorHDI Ranking: 15 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 9 Average Ranking: 12Ecuador is another country on the list with a huge informal economy, whose size is estimated to be 37.2% of its GDP. Apart from informality, many other problems contribute to Ecuador’s underdevelopment. The country’s economy is heavily regulated with virtually no fiscal discipline. Further, the economy is not diversified either, with Ecuador largely relying on revenue from oil export, which makes it vulnerable in the face of demand shocks. The country’s legacy of political instability does not help the situation either. 9. Venezuela HDI Ranking: 7 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 16 Average Ranking: 11.5Venezuela is located on the northern coast of South America. It is underdeveloped due to several political, economic and structural reasons. Venezuela’s economy is almost entirely dependent on oil, which comprises 98% of its exports and makes up 25% of the country’s GDP. This lack of economic diversification leaves the country vulnerable to fluctuations in the oil price and shaves off much of the potential growth that comes from a diversified economy. Other factors include extreme centralization of the economy and US sanctions. The combined effect of the two factors have excessively devalued the Venezuelan Bolivar, adding to the country’s problems. 8. ParaguayHDI Ranking: 12 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 8 Average Ranking: 10Paraguay is a landlocked country in South America. It has a GDP per Capita of $5,891.5 as of 2021. The country remains underdeveloped primarily because of its agrarian economy, that is based on internal consumption and exports to neighboring countries. 7. JamaicaHDI Ranking: 9 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 7 Average Ranking: 8Jamaica is another Caribbean country on the list. It has a GDP per Capita of $5,184 as of 2021. The country is underdeveloped due to several reasons. These include the legacy of military rule, corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies and economic mismanagement. By far, the biggest reason for Jamaica’s underdevelopment is that the economy largely relies on tourism, leaving little room for diversification.6. Bolivia HDI Ranking: 8 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 4 Average Ranking: 6Bolivia has a GDP per Capita of $3,345 as of 2021. It suffers from roughly the same issues as other Latin American countries that are underdeveloped. One exception is that the country is far worse off in infrastructure than most other Hispanic countries. It is ranked 136th out of 167 countries on the Logistics Performance Index. It is also worse off in child mortality, education and other development indicators.  Click to continue reading and see the 5 Least Developed Countries in Latin America.   Suggested Articles:25 Least Developed Countries in Europe25 Least Developed Countries in the World25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldDisclosure: none. 15 Least Developed Countries in Latin America is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

GM declined to comment on the ruling.Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno, Nevada, ordered the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to determine whether Lithium Americas has the right to dump waste rock at the site, just south of Nevada's border with Oregon.Du, however, did not vacate a 2021 decision by then-President Donald Trump to approve the mine. The ruling can be appealed, and environmentalists said they were considering next steps.""We need to find truly just and sustainable solutions for the climate crisis, and not by digging ourselves deeper into the biodiversity crisis,"" said Greta Anderson of the Western Watersheds Project, one of the plaintiffs.Much of the U.S. mining industry is ruled by an 1872 law that gives companies wide berth to extract metals on federal lands. However, an appeals court ruled last year in an unrelated case that miners do not necessarily have the right to store waste rock or erect buildings on federal land not containing valuable minerals.Story continuesIn the 49-page ruling, Du ordered the BLM to determine whether roughly 1,300 acres (530 hectares) at the Thacker Pass site where Lithium Americas hopes to store waste rock - a byproduct of the mining process - contains lithium. Federal officials had told the court last month they believe the entire site contains lithium.Lithium Americas planned to meet with the BLM on Tuesday to begin the review, which should take no longer than six months, Chief Executive Jon Evans said in an interview. ""There is evidence in the record of lithium mineralization throughout the project area,"" he said. ""This is an easy fix.""Site preparation should begin almost immediately, with heavy construction likely to start this summer and last about three years, Evans said.Du also rejected claims from the Reno Sparks Indian Colony and other Native American tribes that they were not properly consulted about the project and its potential effects on cultural and historical sites.Will Falk, attorney for the Reno Sparks Indian Colony, said the tribe had not decided whether to appeal but it would continue to fight the project. ""The campaign to protect Thacker Pass will move into the next phase,"" he said. ""We're not giving up.""

The plant is expected to eventually employ 1,700 people and will produce cells for the Cadillac Lyriq, which is produced at the adjacent GM assembly plant.On Friday, the Treasury reversed course and said it would make more EVs eligible for up to $7,500 tax credits -- including the Lyriq -- by revising how they are classified.Under the $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) approved in August, SUVs can be priced at up to $80,000 to qualify for EV tax credits, while cars, sedans and wagons can be priced at up to $55,000.The Treasury announcement allowed vehicles that automakers consider crossover SUVs to qualify for credits. The decision raises the retail price cap to $80,000 from $55,000 for GM's Cadillac Lyriq, Tesla's five-seat Model Y, Volkswagen's ID.4, and Ford's Mustang Mach-E and Escape Plug-in Hybrid.Yellen and other Cabinet officials are traveling this week to tout the IRA's boosting of green energy manufacturing and battery production. Treasury said Monday that since August, ""dozens of companies across the clean energy spectrum have announced tens of billions of dollars in investments in the United States.""Treasury drew the ire of Senate Energy Committee chair Joe Manchin after the department said it would not issue proposed guidance on battery sourcing rules until March, effectively giving some EVs not meeting new requirements a few months of eligibility in 2023 before the battery rules take effect.The rules are designed to shift the U.S. battery supply chain away from China. China currently produces 70% of batteries for electric vehicles, Treasury said. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)]"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc in FocusHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 4.72% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.63%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.1%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.58%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6 is up 4.3% from last year. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 13.08%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's current payout ratio is 43%. This means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.PNC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $14.94 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 7.02%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, PNC is a compelling investment opportunity.

""The combination of our industry-leading global brands, most innovative fleet, nimble sourcing and our continued focus on profitability positions us well to deliver record yields and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023.""Financial Highlights &amp; OutlookFourth Quarter 2022: Load Factors were in line with guidance at 95%, with Caribbean sailings reaching 100%, and holiday sailings close to 110%.Total revenues per passenger cruise day were up 3.5% as-reported and 4.5% in Constant Currency, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.Total revenues were $2.6 billion, Net Loss was $(500.2) million or $(1.96) per share, Adjusted Net Loss was $(284.9) million or $(1.12) per share, and Adjusted EBITDA was $409.3 million.Full Year 2022: Load Factors were 85% overall, full fleet back in operation since June of 2022.Total revenues were $8.8 billion, Net Loss was $(2.2) billion or $(8.45) per share, Adjusted Net Loss was $(1.9) billion or $(7.50) per share, and Adjusted EBITDA was $711.6 million.Story continuesFull Year 2023 Outlook:The company is experiencing a record-breaking WAVE season, driven by strong demand. The seven biggest booking weeks in the company's history have occurred since the last earnings call in November 2022.2023 cumulative booked position remains well within historical ranges for all quarters and at record rates. North America based itineraries are booked in line with 2019 for the full year, and ahead for the second quarter through the fourth quarter.Net Yields are expected to increase 2.5% to 4.5% in both as-reported and in Constant Currency versus 2019. Net Yields are expected to ramp up as load factors reach historical levels by late spring.The company continues to successfully manage costs in a complicated environment with Net Cruise Costs (NCC), excluding Fuel, per APCD expected to increase 4.5% to 5.5% as-reported and 4.75% to 5.75% in Constant Currency compared to 2019, a three-year old benchmark, and include approximately 210 basis points from lingering transitional costs (e.g. crew movement) and additional structural costs (e.g. full year operations of Perfect Day at CocoCay and the new Galveston terminal).The company expects to exceed prior record Adjusted EBITDA, achieved in 2019.The company expects Adjusted Earnings per Share in the range of $3.00 to $3.60.First Quarter 2023 Outlook:Net Yields are expected to increase 0.5% to 1.5% as-reported and 1% to 2% in Constant Currency compared to 2019, with load factors reaching 100% and total revenues per passenger cruise day up in the mid-to-high single digit range in both as-reported and Constant Currency compared to 2019.NCC, excluding Fuel, per APCD is expected to increase approximately 8.3% as-reported and approximately 8.5% in Constant Currency, compared to 2019, including 320 basis points of lagging transitional costs, additional structural costs, and timing of expenses.Adjusted Loss per Share is expected to be in the range of $(0.65) – $(0.85).Fourth Quarter 2022 ResultsThe company reported Net Loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $(0.5) billion or $(1.96) per share compared to Net Loss of $(1.4) billion or $(5.33) per share for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Loss was $(0.3) billion or $(1.12) per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(1.2) billion or $(4.78) per share for the same period in the prior year.Fourth quarter Load Factors were in line with guidance at 95%, with Caribbean sailings reaching 100%. Total revenues per passenger cruise day were up 3.5% as-reported and 4.5% in Constant Currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019 due to strong pricing on close-in demand and continued strength in onboard revenues.Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 4.9% as-reported and 5.8% in Constant Currency, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. NCC, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 3.9% as-reported and 4.7% in Constant Currency, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD and NCC, excluding Fuel, per APCD for the fourth quarter included $1.23 per APCD related to health protocols and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp up. The Group expects transitory costs related to health protocols and ramp up of operations to be largely gone in 2023 as the majority of crew have returned and protocols have eased. In the fourth quarter, the company continued to benefit from multiple actions taken to reshape its cost structure and to help partially offset inflationary and supply chain challenges.""Fourth quarter results reflect the continued strong demand for our vacation experiences and our teams' ability to manage costs in a complicated environment while staying focused on delivering the best vacation experiences expected by our guests,"" said Naftali Holtz, chief financial officer, Royal Caribbean Group. ""The benefit from multiple actions we have taken during the last few years to improve margins continue to yield results, as we focus on executing our proven formula of moderate yield growth and strong cost controls.""The company recorded a loss contingency of $130 million in the fourth quarter related to a Helms-Burton Act claim which the company continues to vigorously defend.Full Year 2022 ResultsFor the full year, the company reported Net Loss of $(2.2) billion or $(8.45) per share compared to Net Loss of $(5.3) billion or $(20.89) per share in the prior year. The company also reported Adjusted Net Loss of $(1.9) billion or $(7.50) per share for the full year 2022 compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(4.8) billion or $(19.19) per share in the prior year.Update on BookingsThe company is very encouraged about the demand environment for 2023. Booking volumes in the fourth quarter were significantly higher than the corresponding period in 2019, culminating in record booking weeks for the Group for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday.  Momentum continues into early 2023 and the company is experiencing a record-breaking WAVE season. Overall, the seven biggest booking weeks in the company's history have occurred since the middle of November 2022, including the first five weeks of WAVE. The booking window has continued to move back to normal, providing further confidence in forward looking business, as guests plan for the future. Consumer spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases continue to exceed prior years driven by greater participation at higher prices, indicating quality and healthy future demand.The cumulative booked position remains well within historical ranges at record rates and has improved significantly since November. North America sailings, many of which visit Perfect Day at CocoCay, are leading the way and are booked in line with record 2019 levels for the full year and ahead for the second quarter through the fourth quarter. Bookings for European itineraries have been accelerating during WAVE and are now higher than 2019.""Leisure travel strength continues as consumer spend is shifting towards experiences, with cruising remaining an attractive value proposition,"" said Liberty. ""The quality demand trends further exhibit the strength of our brands and the growing propensity to cruise.""As of December 31, 2022, the Group's customer deposit balance was at a record $4.2 billion.Fuel ExpenseBunker pricing, net of hedging, for the fourth quarter was $694 per metric ton and consumption was 422,000 metric tons. The company does not forecast fuel prices and its fuel cost calculations are based on current at-the-pump prices, net of hedging impacts. Based on today's fuel prices, the company has included $294 million of fuel expense in its first quarter guidance at a forecasted consumption of 412,500 which is 57% hedged via swaps. Forecasted consumption is 55% hedged via swaps for full year 2023 and is 10% hedged via swaps for 2024. The annual average cost per metric ton of the hedge portfolio is approximately $583 for 2023 and $826 for 2024. The higher average hedged cost in 2024 is driven primarily by the hedged fuel mix, with 2024 currently hedged with Marine Gas Oil (""MGO"") swaps, while 2023 is hedged fairly evenly between MGO and Intermediate Fuel Oil (""IFO"") swaps.The company provided the following guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023:FUEL STATISTICSFirst Quarter 2023Full Year 2023Fuel Consumption (metric tons)412,5001,654,000Fuel ExpensesApprox. $294 millionApprox. $1,141 millionPercent Hedged (fwd. consumption)57.0 %55.0 %GUIDANCEAs-ReportedConstant CurrencyFirst Quarter 2023Net Yields vs. 2019 0.5% to 1.5%1% to 2%Net Cruise Costs per APCD vs. 2019Approx. 14.7%Approx. 14.9%Net Cruise Costs per APCD ex.

The company expects to take delivery of three new ships in 2023 including Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. All ship orders have committed financing in place. Non-new ship related capital expenditures are expected to be $0.5 billion. Capacity changes for 2023 are expected to be 14% compared to 2019.

For the 2022 and 2021 periods, these items included (i) other expenses, which includes the estimate of amounts payable in connection with ongoing Havana Docks litigation recorded in 2022; (ii) impairment and credit losses; (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) equity investment asset impairments; (v) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; (vi) Pullmantur reorganization settlement; and (vii) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the 2022 and 2021 periods presented, these items included (i) gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt; (ii) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes; (iii) the estimated cash refunds expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests as part of the Pullmantur S.A. reorganization in 2020; (iv) impairment and credit losses; (v) equity investment asset impairments; (vi) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; (vii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (viii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; (ix) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand; (x) the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the three-month reporting lag for Silversea Cruises; and (xi) the estimated amounts that may be payable in relation to the ongoing Havana Docks litigation.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.Available Passenger Cruise Days (""APCD"") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.Constant Currency is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in ""Constant Currency"" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period's rates. For the 2022 periods presented, we calculate ""Constant Currency"" by applying the average 2019 or Q3 2022 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and/or forecasted period, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.EBITDA  is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis.Occupancy (""Load Factor""), in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.Net Cruise Costs (""NCC"") and NCC excluding Fuel are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel, fuel expenses. For the 2022 and 2019 periods presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel exclude (i) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (ii) the transaction and integration costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; and (iii) the costs, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Grand Bahama drydock structure incident involving Oasis of the Seas. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.Gross Margin Yield represent Gross Margin per APCD.Adjusted Gross Margin represent Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, fuel, food, other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.Net Yields represent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses.For additional information see ""Adjusted Measures of Financial Performance"" below.About Royal Caribbean GroupRoyal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL) is one of the leading cruise companies in the world with a global fleet of 64 ships traveling to approximately 1,000 destinations around the world.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Adjusted Measures of Financial PerformanceThis press release includes certain adjusted financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.The presentation of adjusted financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures may be different from adjusted measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Adjusted measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures.A reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure of all adjusted financial measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP projections would require unreasonable effort. Due to significant uncertainty, we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs. In addition, we are unable to determine the future impact of non-core business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives. These items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to this uncertainty, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful. ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS(in thousands, except per share data)Quarter EndedYear EndedDecember 31,December 31,2022202120222021(unaudited)(unaudited)Passenger ticket revenues$          1,702,457$             617,393$          5,793,492$             941,175Onboard and other revenues901,535364,8543,047,048590,958Total revenues2,603,992982,2478,840,5401,532,133Cruise operating expenses:Commissions, transportation and other392,752134,6451,357,008207,562Onboard and other146,32961,164596,554116,946Payroll and related306,673307,8381,287,801838,088Food202,76389,771653,139164,389Fuel292,694166,2641,072,567385,322Other operating441,231375,8221,647,267945,205Total cruise operating expenses1,782,4421,135,5046,614,3362,657,512Marketing, selling and administrative expenses444,358503,0551,582,9291,370,076Depreciation and amortization expenses360,595333,3661,406,6891,292,878Impairment and credit losses1,14642,06756282,001Operating Income (Loss)15,451(1,031,745)(763,976)(3,870,334)Other income (expense):Interest income14,0923,45635,85716,773Interest expense, net of interest capitalized(431,610)(283,767)(1,364,162)(1,291,753)Equity investment income (loss)26,9361,57556,695(135,469)Other (expense) income (for 2021, includes a $62.6 million net loss related to the 2021 elimination of the Silversea Cruises reporting lag)(125,075)(46,487)(120,376)20,284(515,657)(325,223)(1,391,986)(1,390,165)Net Loss$           (500,206)$        (1,356,968)$        (2,155,962)$        (5,260,499)Loss per Share:Basic$                (1.96)$                (5.33)$                (8.45)$               (20.89)Diluted$                (1.96)$                (5.33)$                (8.45)$               (20.89)Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding:Basic255,184254,792255,011251,812Diluted255,184254,792255,011251,812Comprehensive LossNet Loss$           (500,206)$        (1,356,968)$        (2,155,962)$        (5,260,499)Other comprehensive income (loss):Foreign currency translation adjustments(21,663)4,44810,29515,703Change in defined benefit plans13,9234,95948,9148,707Gain (loss) on cash flow derivative hedges157,003(44,468)8,4624,046Total other comprehensive income (loss)149,263(35,061)67,67128,456Comprehensive Loss$           (350,943)$        (1,392,029)$        (2,088,291)$        (5,232,043) ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD....]"

RCL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Royal Caribbean is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RCL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of $1.36 per share for RCL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.37 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for RCL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.97% heading into earnings season.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that RCL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Analog Devices (ADI) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.62 a share nine days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 15, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.59 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of 1.13%.ADI is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Paypal (PYPL).Paypal, which is readying to report earnings on February 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.21 a share, and PYPL is three days out from its next earnings report.Paypal's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.61% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.Story continuesADI and PYPL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Price and EPS SurprisePaycom Software, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Paycom Software, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderPaycom’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong demand for the latest products, new business wins and the high-margin recurring revenue business. The company’s employee usage strategy, sales efforts and investments might have contributed to sales growth in the quarter to be reported.The cloud-based human capital management solution provider earlier announced its intention to aggressively drive advertising and marketing efforts to generate more demo leads, virtual meetings and increased close rates of deals. These are likely to have led to market share gains for Paycom.The company continues to expect the strong adoption of the BETI solution, the industry-first technology that empowers employees to do their payroll among clients, aiding them in avoiding time-consuming manual checks. We anticipate new client additions to have driven the top line in the fourth quarter.However, Paycom’s quarterly performance is expected to have been affected by macroeconomic uncertainty-triggered economic and business disruptions, which might have hurt the headcount across its client base. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.Story continuesWhat Our Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PAYC this season.

The heightened demand for its security and networking products amid the post-pandemic reality of remote working and the accelerated emergence of digital technologies might have benefited the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.The rapid adoption of FortiGate-based secure Software-Defined Wide Area Network (“SD-WAN”) offerings is likely to have supported Fortinet’s Product segment.

This might have driven the company’s private and public cloud billings.Story continuesFortinet’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have gained from higher global cybersecurity spending. The growing adoption of SD-WAN solutions might have acted as a tailwind.

Expected to open by the end of 2023, the new Regions branch is a vital part of the community's recovery.Mary McMillan Waverly Branch ManagerRegions has always been a great company to work for, but I gained new admiration for Regions when they decided to invest in Waverly's future.After the most recent flood, a lot of businesses didn't reopen or simply rebuilt again in the flood zone. Not Regions. This new location shows we're dedicated to serving the community while also looking out for our associates and customers.I look back at the first few months after the last flood in 2021, and just think how far we have come in helping our customers through such a traumatic event. Regions provided us with all the tools and resources that we needed to continue to serve our customers.I'll always be proud of my team for the way they excelled in helping to get our customers get back on their feet. Soon, we'll be able to offer them a facility that empowers them further with the latest technology to serve our customers even better.Kathy Peyton MidSouth Regional Operations ManagerConsidering the Waverly branch has endured three floods in a short amount of time (2010, 2019 and 2021), we've gone through it all as part of the community - helping rebuild, offering volunteers, and simply giving back as a sign of hope and commitment.I'll never forget the way the managers in our market (Jackson, Bolivar, Lexington, Hohenwald, Somerville, Selmer, Corinth, New Albany and Ripley) volunteered in clean-up efforts after the flood. And I will always remember the way Mary and her team kept the community top of mind by organizing events like a toy drive for Humphreys County Angel Tree because they knew it focused solely on the people of Waverly.Story continuesMary and team were instrumental in helping us retrieve the muddy cash from the branch, helping customers through the transition of opening their wet safe deposit boxes, and listening to customers share their stories of loss from the flood with empathy and tears.What they have done really has gone above and beyond what is expected, but Mary has helped me, with a smile on her face, through any operational challenge.Seeing this team flourish inside a temporary trailer building for the last year and a half - and be extremely successful - I cannot wait to see their success in a new Nexus branch.For us to remain committed to this community and our associates is what makes this new branch groundbreaking so special to me, and makes me proud to be a part of Regions.Scott Beard Market Executive for Jackson and West TennesseeI grew up in this area. It is close to my hometown and very special to me. The people here take care of each other.Nothing makes me happier than to witness this area's recovery which includes the way Regions is building back better and making Waverly stronger through our new branch.The groundbreaking and the construction of the new building are vital steps by Regions to help Waverly come back stronger.It's a town of resilience and determination - demonstrated again by the community's response and rebuilding after the August 2021 flood which left 6 feet of water in our branch and caused so much other damage to businesses and homes. The people in Waverly have a genuine concern for each other and support their hometown businesses. Regions' presence is vital to this area to help support our associates and customers that have been so loyal in supporting us over the years.This new building is not only for our customers, but also for our associates and serves as another testament to the way Regions puts people first while seeking to do the right thing and make life better for everyone. This new modern building will help our associates in Waverly continue to provide the excellent service and financial advice that have won customers' trust.Rudy Walker MidSouth Consumer Banking ExecutiveTeam Waverly has showed remarkable resilience that should make us all proud - remaining engaged in the community and fostering lasting relationships through not one but two major floods, and working out of our Portable Branch first, and then a temporary trailer.Through it all, our associates have shown what putting people first really means and continue to be there for customers.Just doing the job has never been this team's attitude. They truly know their customers and have been part of helping them prepare for and celebrate their biggest life moments with the financial advice and guidance they've provided. That's confirmed by their world-class Gallup scores, and it's something you feel as soon as you walk into the branch.Thank you, Team Waverly, and to all the other associates who made this moment possible.About Regions Financial Corporation Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $155 billion in assets, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index and is one of the nation's largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Visa (NYSE:V). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Visa with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Visa Visa's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Visa has grown EPS by 9.6% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Visa remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 18% to US$30b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Visa?Are Visa Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Visa, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$250m. This comes in at 0.05% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesDoes Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Visa is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Visa that we have uncovered.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

However, the world's largest credit card network saw its revenue wind back to pre-pandemic levels, as consumer spending slowed. Here to discuss the outlook for the payment industry is Visa's chief financial officer Vasant Prabhu. Thank you for joining me this morning, Vasant. So, a lot of people have been wondering, what are some of the trends, then, that are going to dominate the payments space as we really try and grapple coming off the peak of the pandemic and really trying to figure out how the consumer spends right now?VASANT PRABHU: Sure, thank you for having me. Well, I guess the best way to describe the consumer is very stable. Consumer spending has been very steady for the entire year of 2022, steady almost day by day, week by week, month by month. It's about 45%, 46% higher than pre-pandemic levels 2019. But it's shifting. Over the year, it's moved more towards services, away from goods. People are doing things, rather than buying things. Restaurants, travel, entertainment are all booming. All in all, consumers have adjusted to inflation. Food and drug is spending. Essentials are quite stable. If you look at spending, it looks like the consumer is still confident and pretty much has stayed confident all the way through 2022 and into January with no real change in trend.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then what are some of the specific places that they're spending this money? We know that at first, there was that sort of pandemic build-up to go into travel and leisure. But then as that tapered off, where is the money now going?VASANT PRABHU: Well, what happened was in 2020, of course, things fell. And then things started to pick up, first in the goods categories. You know, people were at home, and there was a big boom in buying things-- home improvement projects, apparel, retail goods, e-commerce, et cetera. And people bought a lot in 2021. As we got into 2022 and economy started to open up, countries started to open up, we started to see people do things they couldn't do. They had a lot of savings in the bank. And they started to go out, travel more, go to restaurants, more entertainment, more spending on services. And that's what we're seeing now.Story continuesSo if you look at good spending, I know it's slowed year over year. And you hear that when you listen to everybody. But if you compare it to 2019, it's doing just fine. It's just that they had a big boom in '21, and now it's the time for travel, restaurants, services, et cetera, to catch up. And that's where we're seeing the growth right now.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to ask you about another trend that we saw really pick up, especially over the last year-- buy now, pay later-- that continues to grow in popularity with consumers. And I know you have Visa installment as an option there. What sort of growth are you seeing among clients in that space?VASANT PRABHU: Well, buy now, pay later is another option that consumers have to pay for things. They can do it with a credit card. They can do it with a debit card. Or they can try buy now, pay later. And some consumers will, and some consumers are. We help our clients do it. We partner with buy now, pay later providers to also do it.It'll take a while to develop. It's had something of a setback as things have slowed down, but it will probably grow over time. As far as we're concerned, our job is to enable consumers to pay in whichever way they want. And we will enable buy now, pay later, much as we do all other forms of payment and all of the ways that consumers want to pay. And buy now, pay later will have a role to play in the long run.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And speaking of the ways that people pay, obviously, still a lot of adults-- I think about 1/3 of the global population perhaps still unbanked at the moment. And I know that Visa has been looking at innovations built on blockchain and things like that. What are some of the innovations and ways that you're planning on really reaching some more of the unbanked?VASANT PRABHU: Absolutely. This is a major priority for us and has been for a long time. Clearly, we've made a lot of progress through the pandemic. If you look at the amount of credentials or cards out there, they have grown quite a bit in the last couple of years and are growing fast still. A variety of new ways to enable consumers to pay digitally have emerged around the world. Wallets, for example, digital wallets, very popular in emerging markets. We're partnering with most of the digital wallet players. Our credentials are embedded in these wallets.In many parts of Africa, people use their phones to pay. They work with the telecom companies. We are partners with the telecom companies across Africa. Again, we embed our credentials. This is another way in which people are empowered and brought into the digital economy, the financial economy. Of course, we work with a whole range of other players to enable people to have bank accounts as a way to get access to digital payments and other ways to pay. So there's a whole range of possibilities here.And in fact, it's growing as technology has improved. And a significant amount of movement into the space has happened in the last two years. And of course, blockchain will have a role to play. We do partner with a variety of people who provide cryptocurrency services. We don't have a point of view on cryptocurrencies, per se. But we do partner with people who allow people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, which can be helpful to people in countries where the local currency isn't that reliable. So it's a major initiative. It's multipronged, and it will go on for a long time.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, I do thank you for taking the time to join us on Yahoo Finance this morning. Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu, and congrats on the past quarter, a bumper quarter, indeed.VASANT PRABHU: Thank you.]"

So if gas is good for you to run an economy but it's bad for me to generate power, there's a problem,"" Makamba told the conference in Bengaluru.Japan also stopped financing two coal power plant projects in Indonesia and Bangladesh in June, responding to global criticism over its continued support for the polluting fuel.Top global lenders - under pressure from investors, Western governments and campaigners - have squeezed credit lines that finance projects based on fossil fuels in a bid to achieve net-zero emissions across their financing portfolios.Government officials in some countries and industry officials call this discriminatory.""The choices for me to be able to increase (energy) access and consumption cannot be impaired by politics that have nothing to do with me,"" Makamba said.PRICED OUTBir Bikram Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the energy adviser to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said a surge in gas prices after sweeping sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine made LNG inaccessible for the south Asian country.Story continues""There were ships floating around Western Europe carrying gas, and other countries were not able to buy because of the price,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.Bangladesh, which counts on natural gas for over two-thirds of its power generation, was one of the worst hit by the surge in LNG prices. Major cities in Bangladesh were forced to resort to hours of power cuts during the second half of 2022, disrupting commercial and industrial activity.""Western countries literally priced us out of market,"" Chowdhury said.Zimbabwe, where electricity shortages were among the key reasons for slower economic growth in 2022, is still far from transitioning from traditional sources of power, its deputy energy minister Magna Mudyiwa said.""We are a growing economy, plenty of mining is going on, plenty of agriculture is going on. We still need some more electricity in Zimbabwe. And then we can talk about transitioning from what we have to green energy,"" she said.India, the world's second largest consumer, importer and producer of coal, has often defended high use of the polluting fuel, saying its per capita emissions were lower than richer nations and it needed a cheap source of energy to ensure supplies.A growing risk of power outages due to sanctions on its main gas supplier Russia forced the European Union to double down on coal for power generation last year, inviting criticism from climate activists.Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' climate envoy and designated COP28 president, said ""the Global South, where almost 800 million people have no electricity,"" should be empowered in ""an inclusive energy transition.""""The energy transition has the potential to generate the greatest leap in economic prosperity since the first industrial revolution. But it must be fair,"" Jaber said.""When it comes to the Global South, they have seen little justice so far."" (Writing by Sudarshan Varadhan Editing by Mark Potter)]"

With uploading data becoming increasingly important for video chats, uploading large files or live streaming video, this significant accomplishment is yet another milestone in Verizon’s commitment to provide a genuinely differentiated service for customers.“We have achieved remarkable speed in downloading using various combinations of spectrum in our world-class spectrum portfolio,” said Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Technology Planning at Verizon. “This new achievement indicates how much additional performance we can unleash for our customers on the uplink as we aggregate different combinations of spectrum.”The lab work and trials in the field focused on optimizing the customer experience, and used 20 MHz of LTE spectrum and 400 MHz of mmWave spectrum from the 28 GHz band. The trials used devices currently commercially available and were completed in a live network test environment.Past trials have shown extraordinary download speeds with various combinations of spectrum reaching a remarkable 4.3 Gbps download speeds by aggregating Verizon’s mid-band C-band spectrum with high band mmWave spectrum. As more C-band spectrum becomes available and deployed, customers will continue to see increases in both download and upload speeds.Integrating C-bandVerizon won C-Band licenses for between 140-200 MHz in all available markets, and began in the first 46 areas deploying up to 60 MHz, quickly expanding to an additional 30 markets deploying up to 100 MHz in many of those. Over the next few years, as additional spectrum is cleared by satellite companies, Verizon will be able to deploy 5G Ultra Wideband on all available bandwidth that it has licensed, up to 200 MHz. Every piece of equipment being deployed today is capable of using the full 200 MHz of bandwidth.When the full breadth of spectrum is accessed, customers can expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second experienced with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, the 5G stand-alone core is being deployed. So by the end of the year, customers should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink.Story continuesBest spectrum position, best spectrum efficiencyWith the recent acquisition of C-band spectrum, Verizon now leads the industry with the strongest spectrum portfolio across low, mid and high band spectrum. Verizon holds a total of 2,035 MHz of spectrum – 294 MHz in Sub 6 GHz spectrum (low and mid band) and 1,741 MHz of mmWave spectrum (high band).Low band: Verizon’s low band spectrum (nationwide 700 MHz licenses and 850 MHz spectrum) continues to provide the best 4G LTE experience in the industry and now also supports nationwide 5G service, giving customers in over 2,700 markets access to 5G. Low band signals travel great distances and penetrate through walls and dense foliage very effectively.High band: Verizon’s mmWave build is a critical differentiator and the company continues to expand its mmWave footprint to deliver game changing experiences for the densest parts of the network. mmWave brings the benefits of highly predictable signal waves leading to greater efficiency and less interference for customers, and also boasts huge capacity. mmWave service is ideal to deliver 5G service in high-usage areas like cities, venues, and stadiums for years to come.Mid-band: Verizon’s mid-band spectrum assets include AWS, PCS, CBRS and C-band spectrum. C-band provides a valuable middle ground between capacity and coverage for 5G networks, and is enabling greater speeds than 5G on low band spectrum and greater coverage than mmWave spectrum for both mobility and home broadband solutions. The addition of C-band spectrum paves the way for Verizon to provide its differentiated service of 5G Ultra Wideband service to millions of customers, now covering more than 175 million and growing quickly.Verizon’s strong spectrum position is a result of multi-year strategic planning and investment. Having access to the strongest spectrum portfolio in the market is only half the battle, though. For many years, Verizon has been innovative and creative in its network build to use the spectrum in its portfolio in the most efficient way possible, providing the best experience for customers while carefully controlling deployment and operational costs and maximizing advanced technologies to maximizes every possible speed and capacity benefit from its spectrum resources.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.schulz@verizonwireless.com]"

For fans enjoying football parties to close out the season and for those coming in to enjoy the pro football draft this spring, Verizon has made major network enhancements throughout Kansas City.The biggest upgrade for residents and visitors in Kansas City is 5G Ultra Wideband technology which engineers have added to 75% of the cell sites serving the market. 5G Ultra Wideband enables customers to experience the power and performance of Verizon’s service with download speeds up to one gigabit per second and the capacity to support data-heavy actions, like mobile gaming and streaming.The speeds and capacity of 5G Ultra Wideband will give a huge boost to large gatherings of people participating in the upcoming football-related festivities and will provide long term benefits to the area. Customers across Kansas City can now do everything from downloading huge documents and seamlessly streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games, and conducting video chats and video conferencing calls with clear sound and video while on the move.Traveling to Kansas CityFor visitors traveling to Kansas City, Verizon engineers are installing a permanent Distributed Antenna System (DAS) in Kansas City International Airport, scheduled to go live in March. This will provide wireless service throughout the terminals and make it easier for travelers to connect and download content to keep them entertained on flights. When traveling around the city, residents and visitors will enjoy added capacity and coverage through the addition of four new macro cell sites covering the metro area and permanent in-building solutions at the World War I Memorial and Loews Hotel.Story continuesAnticipating an influx of visitors, Verizon engineers will deploy temporary cell sites specifically covering the areas where draft events will take place. These temporary towers will provide 5G Ultra Wideband coverage and use a performance enhancement technology that divides crowds into sectors like slices of a pie. Each slice or sector can be adjusted individually to handle wireless traffic. This technology gives Verizon engineers more leeway to adjust performance based on where customers move and how they use data. Additional temporary in-building solutions will be added to Union Station IBS and local hotels including the Westin and Sharaton.Growing fiber connectionsLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Kansas City. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Kansas City area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.So for customers living in, or traveling to, Kansas City for all the football action over the next several months, Verizon has a network they can count on.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.schulz@verizonwireless.com]"

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote The year-over-year upside was primarily driven by 4.1% reported and 7.9% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues. U.S. CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues increased 9.4% on a reported as well as organic basis.Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 15% as reported and 17% organically, driven by double-digit growth in subscription-based service revenues and strong growth in new veterinary software system placements.Total revenues for 2022 were $33.67 billion, reflecting a 4.7% rise from the year-ago period. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%.Our model projected full-year 2022 revenue of $33.51 billion.Segmental AnalysisIDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments — CAG, Water, Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) and Other.In the fourth quarter, CAG revenues rose 4.1% on a reported basis (up 7.9% organically) year over year to $748.5 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year EPS is currently pegged at $9.46.Our TakeIDEXX exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a decent note, with earnings and revenues beating estimates. The company registered year-over-year growth in revenues on both reported and organic basis. The top line was driven by continued benefits from the expansion of IDEXX's global premium instrument installed base. CAG Diagnostics’ organic recurring revenue growth reflects solid gains across IDEXX's major modalities globally, supported by growth in clinical service demand and expanded utilization of diagnostic products and services.On the flip side, LPD revenues declined in the quarter on a reported basis.

Excluding COVID-19 headwinds, Avantor's core organic sales growth rate was 2.7% during the reported period.Per management, the year-over-year uptick in the fourth quarter’s core organic sales reflected ongoing strength in Avantor's core business. However, this was partially offset by inventory destocking in liquid handling and single-use tubing, a weaker-than-expected year-end budget flush and headwinds resulting from fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2022.Full-year revenues were $7.51 billion, reflecting a 1.7% improvement from the comparable 2021 period. The full-year revenue compares to our estimate of $7.49 billion.Segmental AnalysisAvantor reports financial results in three geographic segments based on customer location — the Americas, Europe and AMEA (Asia, Middle-East and Africa).The Americas segment’s net sales were $1.05 million, reflecting a reported decline of 3.6% year over year. Core organic sales, however, inched up 0.1% in the reported quarter. The region witnessed strong growth in serum, process ingredients and excipients for bioprocessing and custom formulations for the semiconductor space, offset by destocking headwinds in liquid handling consumables and single-use tubing.Story continuesThis compares to our projection of fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $1.05 billion, in line with the company-reported number.Europe’s net sales were $617.2 million, reflecting a reported decrease of 10.1%, whereas core organic sales increased 6.3% year over year. Per management, the growth in core organic sales was driven by strength in bioproduction and biomaterials.This compares to our projection of fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $603.4 million.AMEA arm’s net sales were $129.8 million, indicating a reported fall of 3.1% year over year. Core organic sales increased 5.7% year over year, driven by sales of proprietary materials to advanced technologies and applied materials customers and bioproduction strength in process ingredients and excipients.This compares to our projection of fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $123.6 million.Avantor, Inc.

The operating margin in the quarter also expanded 281 bps to 14%.We had projected 13.1% of the operating margin for the fourth quarter.Financial PositionAvantor exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $372.9 million compared with $301.7 million at the end of 2021.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently reflects a decline of 0.8%.Avantor expects to register organic revenue growth of 0-2% for the full year.COVID-19 headwinds are expected to be 2.5% for the full year. Excluding COVID-19 headwinds, core organic revenue growth is projected to lie within 2.5-4.5%.Avantor expects its adjusted EPS to lie within $1.35-$1.45 for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.39.Our TakeThe decline in Avantor’s adjusted EPS and the overall reported revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 is disappointing. The decline in the overall organic sales and reported revenues in each segment are discouraging. Macroeconomic factors like tighter financial conditions, global supply-chain constraints and the ongoing geopolitical conflict also raised apprehensions about the company’s financial strength.On the positive side, Avantor exited the fourth quarter with better-than-expected results. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its overall and segmental core organic sales, which is impressive. Strength in Avantor’s end markets is encouraging. The company’s pipeline of new product launches and robust demand from its bioproduction customers for its end-to-end fluid management solution also raise optimism about the stock. The continued demand for Avantor’s Ritter and Masterflex products also looks promising. The expansion of both margins also bodes well.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAvantor currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

295,345c61c0-bc05-312e-beb6-474f619abb3c,APD,2023-02-07,The Returns At Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-air-products-chemicals-nyse-110012111.html,1675767612,STORY,['APD'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Air Products and Chemicals is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.098 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$28b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 9.8%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 12% average generated by the Chemicals industry. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Air Products and Chemicals' ROCE Trending?In terms of Air Products and Chemicals' historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. The company has employed 53% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 9.8%. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.The Bottom LineIn conclusion, Air Products and Chemicals has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Since the stock has gained an impressive 100% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals  that we think you should be aware of.While Air Products and Chemicals may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

You can skip our detailed analysis of African development and go directly to the 10 Least Developed Countries in Africa.Africa is the fastest economically-developing region in the world. Countries like Rwanda and Ethiopia grew with an average rate of 7.5% over the past 20 years. However, factors like corruption, political instability and violence have been holding back much of the economic progress on the continent in general. Other two important factors that have played a role in hampering development in Africa are poor infrastructure and heavy reliance of many of its countries on agriculture, with 70% of the African workforce employed in agricultural sectors. In this regard, African economies are also some of the most climate-vulnerable in the world. Further, many African countries have failed to industrialize and industrial output on the continent has actually seen a decline. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Africa made up 3% of the global manufacturing in the 70s, but the continent’s output had reduced by around 1.5% by 2016. Regardless, many countries and corporations are engaged in developing the continent. Which Countries Are Investing in Africa?China has been increasing its foothold on the continent, while at the same time, the US has been decreasing its investments in Africa. Chinese investment in Africa grew by 44% from 2014 to 2018, with $46 billion invested in 2018, while that of the US decreased by 30% during the same period.China has been heavily investing into three countries — Nigeria, South Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo. These three countries received 40.3% of the Chinese investments during the four-year period, with Nigeria receiving the lion’s share of the three countries, at $14.2 billion.Corporate Investments in AfricaSeveral corporations have also been paying attention to the continent, with US companies having invested $48 billion in Africa, according to the Borgen Project. Some of the prominent US companies focusing on Africa include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI). Story continuesThe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s ‘Google Africa’ has a number of projects in Africa, including the expansion of The Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s own network, installation of Google Fiber, and investments in renewable energy.Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) has also been focused on development in Africa, while making a buck. In this regard, Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) is establishing its local branches in many African countries to share profits with the local community. Finally, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is working with several organizations like World Vision in Africa and Riders for Health to improve access to quality education and healthcare on the continent. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also opened up a production plant in Nigeria in 2017. Chinese companies have also been investing in Africa. However, as of late, they’ve been investing more in West Africa, moving away from the traditional North African markets.Let’s now move on to the 25 least developed countries in Africa.25 Least Developed Countries in AfricaMickyWiswedel / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list, we’ve defined ‘least developed countries in Africa’ as ones with low human development and GDP per Capita. In this regard, we’ve selected African countries from the Human Development Index (HDI) of 2021-22 with the lowest scores. We then took into account their GDPs per Capita and then assigned each country two rankings based on their HDI scores and GDPs per Capita.We’ve ranked these countries based on the average of the two rankings and listed them in a descending order of low development. For countries with the same averaged-out values, we’ve used their rankings in GDP per Capita as the tiebreaker.Note: The data on human development in Somalia is lacking, due to widespread destruction and conflict. Therefore, we have used Somalia’s ranking (in descending order of poor infrastructure) among African countries on the Logistics Performance Index as a substitute for human development, since human development and infrastructure development are interrelated. 25. TogoHDI Ranking: 28 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 21 Average Ranking: 24.5Togo is a West African country with a GDP per Capita of $973 as of 2021. Togo is caught in a cycle of poverty, due to corruption, economic mismanagement and informality in the economy. The two biggest factors holding Togo back are the poor infrastructure and water insecurity, with 37% of the population having no access to clean water. 24. SenegalHDI Ranking: 21 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 27 Average Ranking: 24Senegal is another West African nation on the list of the least developed countries in Africa. It has a GDP per Capita of $1,637 as of 2021. It has one of the poorest infrastructures in the world, ranking in 141st position out of 167 countries on the Aggregate Logistics Performance Index. 23. LesothoHDI Ranking: 23 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 23 Average Ranking: 23Lesotho is one of the most underdeveloped African countries, with rampant corruption, inequality and a poor infrastructure. 22. UgandaHDI Ranking: 24 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 18 Average Ranking: 21Uganda is an East African country with a GDP per Capita of $884 as of 2021. The economy largely relies on agriculture.According to 2018 figures from the World Bank, agriculture employs 70% of the country’s population, making up half of Uganda's income from exports and a quarter of its GDP. This reliance on agriculture has left Uganda as one of the least developed countries in Africa.21. RwandaHDI Ranking: 26 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 16 Average Ranking: 21Rwanda is located in Central Africa, and has a GDP per Capita of $822 as of 2021. Rwanda’s economy is largely based on subsistence agriculture and the country was devastated in the 90s war. Rwanda's  population has grown rapidly and there’s a scarcity of arable land in the country. These factors, combined with corruption, income inequality and lack of access to quality education and healthcare, has kept Rwanda underdeveloped. 20. Ethiopia HDI Ranking: 16 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 20 Average Ranking: 18Ethiopia has a GDP per Capita of $925 as of 2021. The country is underdeveloped for several reasons like an agriculture-based economy with limited diversification, poor infrastructure, limited access to education, and corruption. Ethiopia lacks the infrastructure for a thriving modern economy, and ranks 131st out of 167 countries on the aggregate Logistics Performance Index. 19. GuineaHDI Ranking: 10 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 25 Average Ranking: 17.5Guinea is underdeveloped because of corruption, lack of economic diversification, political instability and poor infrastructure. Corruption is particularly a huge problem in the country, with Guinea ranking in 150th position out of 180 countries on the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 2021. 18. SudanHDI Ranking: 19 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 13 Average Ranking: 16Sudan is one of the least developed countries in Africa, with a GDP per Capita of $752 as of 2021. The country is underdeveloped due to corruption, political instability, and economic dependence on oil. It has had a history of military coups and civil war, and corruption is endemic in Sudan, with the country ranking 164th out of 180 countries on 2021 CPI. These factors have greatly undermined its economic prospects. 17. GambiaHDI Ranking: 17 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 14 Average Ranking: 15.5Gambia has poor infrastructure, with the country ranking 138th out of 167 countries on the aggregate Logistics Performance Index. Moreover, political instability, including military coups, has disrupted economic prosperity in the country. 16. Malawi HDI Ranking: 22 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 9 Average Ranking: 15.5Malawi is underdeveloped due to an agriculture-based economy that is not diversified enough due to poor infrastructure and lack of foreign investment. Other factors include corruption, political instability and limited access to facilities like education, healthcare and clean water. 15. Guinea-BissauHDI Ranking: 14 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 15 Average Ranking: 14.5Guinea-Bissau has a GDP per Capita of $795 as of 2021, making it one of the least developed African countries. Several factors like corruption, economic reliance on agriculture and political instability have stunted the country’s economic potential. 14. Burkina FasoHDI Ranking: 9 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 19 Average Ranking: 14Burkina Faso is a landlocked country located in West Africa. The country largely lags behind in development due to civil strife, violence and political instability. Due to these factors, Burkina Faso is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world. 13. EritreaHDI Ranking: 15 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 10 Average Ranking: 12.5Eritrea has a GDP per Capita of $644 as of 2021. Apart from the common factors of African countries’ low development, Eritrea has also been subject to economic sanctions by the UN and Western countries like the US. Moreover, one-third of Eritrea’s economy is based on rain-fed agriculture and 20% on mining, making it highly vulnerable to weather patterns and demand shocks.12. MaliHDI Ranking: 7 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 17 Average Ranking: 12.5Mali has a GDP per Capita of $874 as of 2021. The factors responsible for Mali’s underdevelopment are the same as other African countries — poor infrastructure, political and civil unrest and an agriculture-based economy. 11. LiberiaHDI Ranking: 13 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 11 Average Ranking: 12Liberia is located in West Africa, and has a GDP per Capita of $676 as of 2021. Liberia’s economy is heavily dependent on natural resource extraction, which leaves it vulnerable to demand shocks. In addition, nearly half of the Liberian economy is informal. Click to continue reading and see the 10 Least Developed Countries in Africa.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Cummins shares have added about 5.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Cummins?While Cummins has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cummins: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.87 on $7.66 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $20.09 on $31.01 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines is currently in the bottom 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector, Standard Motor Products (SMP), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This auto parts maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -42.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Standard Motor Products' revenues are expected to be $337.09 million, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Those appointees will then have to be confirmed by state senators. The new rules prevent anyone with ties to a theme park in the past three years from serving on the board.“Florida is dissolving the corporate kingdom and beginning a new era of accountability and transparency,” Bryan Griffin, DeSantis’ press secretary, said in an emailed statement. The former rules “gifted extraordinary special privileges to a single corporation.”Reedy Creek is currently governed by a five-member board of supervisors, elected by local property owners, according to its charter. Given that most of the land within the district is owned by Disney and its affiliates, the company has out-sized decision-making power.The proposed legislation keeps in place Reedy Creek’s obligation to almost $1 billion of outstanding bonds and maintains its present revenue streams. The bill text specified that “no bond or other instrument of indebtedness” previously issued by the district will be affected.In a statement, Jeff Vahle, president of the Walt Disney World resort, said the company is monitoring the progress of the legislation.“Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” he said.Story continuesNew NameUnder the current proposal, Reedy Creek would be renamed the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.”Read more: What Florida’s Action Against Disney Means: QuickTakeThe changes are a culmination of a clash between Florida’s governor and one of the state’s largest employers. Last year, DeSantis signed a law that would have dissolved Reedy Creek, which provides municipal functions such as water, infrastructure and emergency services to Walt Disney World Resort. The move was a response by what DeSantis saw as Disney’s criticism of a law he signed that limits elementary school teachings about gender identity. He said the district gave the company powers other businesses did not have.“We didn’t want anybody doing business in Florida, which is a privilege, having any unfair advantage,” Representative Fred Hawkins, a Republican who sponsored the legislation, said in an interview.The bill will be discussed in a Florida House state affairs committee hearing on Wednesday and is expected to be debated by the full legislature later this week. Eventually, a version will be brought to DeSantis for his signature. Republicans have a large majority in both legislative chambers, likely fast-tracking approval. Hawkins said he hadn’t spoken with bondholders, but said he’d met several times with Disney representatives.Created in 1967, the Reedy Creek district was instrumental in turning 38.5 square miles of mostly swamp land into a theme park complex that gets millions of visitors every year. Its board of supervisors usually deals with issues like infrastructure financing, growth management and development regulations, while also appointing a district administrator.The new bill would also eliminate some of the more obscure powers the district had but never used. Its current charter mentions, for instance, the ability to build public utilities facilities for the “the transmission of power through nuclear fission,” which is not included in the proposed legislation. It will also require the new board to present a report within a year to eliminate more district powers.The bill would allow Florida to impose taxes on Disney for possible road projects outside of the district’s boundaries, Griffin said.It would also create “an avenue to compel Disney to contribute to local infrastructure,” he said, eliminating “Disney’s self-governing status.”--With assistance from Thomas Buckley.(Adds company comment in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAThat Zoom Meeting Really Could Have Been a Simple Phone CallWhen Financial Bubbles Are Hard to PopA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, Too©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

LynchWASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has charged a neo-Nazi leader and his associate with plotting to attack Baltimore's power grid, a plan the FBI thwarted with the help of a confidential informant.Brandon Russell, of Orlando, Florida and Sarah Clendaniel from Maryland, were arrested last week, officials said in a briefing on Monday, and they have been charged with conspiring to damage an energy facility.Russell is a convicted felon and founder of a neo-Nazi group called the Atomwaffen Division that works toward ""ushering in the collapse of civilization,"" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that tracks U.S. hate groups.Russell previously was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to possession of an unregistered destruction device and the improper storage of explosive materials.At the time of his arrest, he was still on supervised release, according to the FBI.The FBI on Monday alleged the plot was racially motivated but did not provide details. About 62% of Baltimore city residents are Black, according to U.S. Census data.Representatives for Clendaniel and Russell could not immediately be reached for comment.""Clendaniel and Russell conspired and took steps to shoot multiple electrical substations in the Baltimore area aiming to 'completely destroy this whole city', but these plans were stopped,"" Erek Barron, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, said in the press briefing.Russell first came under suspicion in 2017, when his former roommate Devon Arthurs was arrested for murder.During his interview with the FBI, Arthurs said his fellow roommates were plotting to attack U.S. infrastructure, including power lines in Florida.The information led to Russell's arrest and subsequent conviction.Then, starting in at least June 2022, an FBI confidential informant started to receive encrypted messages from a user known as ""Homunculus” who encouraged the informant to attack electrical substations, the complaint says.Story continuesIn those communications over the next few months, Homunculus urged an attack “when there is greatest strain on the grid,” and noted that follow-up attacks could further lead to a ""cascading failure costing billions of dollars.”In January 2023, as their communications continued, a third user known as @kali1889 joined the conversation. She said she had compiled a list of potential targets, including Baltimore, noting the location was “literally like a life artery.”According to the complaint, the account @kali1889 was traced to Clendaniel, who also has an extensive criminal record including a prior conviction for armed robbery.“Homunculus,” meanwhile, was traced back to Russell, the FBI said.Baltimore Gas and Electric, a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation, which owns the targeted substations, said there was no damage to any of its equipment or outages.The arrests followed recent vandalization of electrical substations that left thousands of people without power in other states including North Carolina, South Carolina and Washington.The motives for those attacks were not known.Thomas Sobocinski, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore office, said the FBI was not aware of any links between the two people arrested in the alleged Baltimore plot and attacks elsewhere on electrical infrastructure.In Tacoma, Washington, four electrical substations were vandalized around Christmas, leaving over 14,000 customers without power. Two men were arrested in connection with those attacks.Also in December, a utility in North Carolina reported outages from what local authorities said were orchestrated shootings investigated by federal law enforcement. Duke Energy Corp, which provided power to the area, said at the time a total of 45,000 people had lost power. The FBI also investigated shots fired near a power facility in South Carolina days later.

But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 16%. That's well below the market decline of 9.4%. Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 6.5% in three years.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial While Prudential Financial made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.Prudential Financial's revenue didn't grow at all in the last year. In fact, it fell 13%. That looks pretty grim, at a glance. The stock price has languished lately, falling 16% in a year. What would you expect when revenue is falling, and it doesn't make a profit? We think most holders must believe revenue growth will improve, or else costs will decline.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPrudential Financial is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Prudential Financial stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Prudential Financial's TSR for the last 1 year was -12%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 9.4% in the twelve months, Prudential Financial shareholders did even worse, losing 12% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Prudential Financial better, we need to consider many other factors.

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial HIG and Old Republic International ORI. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With seven hikes in interest rate in 2022, already one this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products as well as exposure to intangible assets offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by the analysts for the current year.    Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Prudential Financial (PRU). PRU is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.62, while its industry has an average P/E of 9.63. Over the past year, PRU's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.48 and as low as 7.31, with a median of 8.64.PRU is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.99. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PRU's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.57. Within the past year, PRU's PEG has been as high as 1.13 and as low as 0.81, with a median of 0.96.Investors should also recognize that PRU has a P/B ratio of 2.23. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PRU's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.11. PRU's P/B has been as high as 2.39 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 1.24, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PRU has a P/S ratio of 0.6. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.89.Zurich Insurance Group (ZURVY) may be another strong Insurance - Multi line stock to add to your shortlist. ZURVY is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Shares of Zurich Insurance Group are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 11.34 and a PEG ratio of 1.50 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 9.63 and 1.57, respectively.ZURVY's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 15.14 and as low as 9.97, with a median of 11.59, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.05, with a median of 1.34, all within the past year.Zurich Insurance Group sports a P/B ratio of 2.48 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.11. In the past 52 weeks, ZURVY's P/B has been as high as 2.57, as low as 1.60, with a median of 2.18.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Prudential Financial and Zurich Insurance Group are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PRU and ZURVY sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PRU may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Prudential Financial is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PRU in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.58 per share for PRU, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PRU, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.46% heading into earnings season.Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrudential Financial, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrudential Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prudential Financial, Inc.

This oil and gas company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.35% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors at PlayDevon Energy’s domestic focus and multi-basin, high-quality assets ensure strong production volumes. The acquisition of RimRock Oil and Gas LP in the Williston Basin is likely to be accretive to its fourth-quarter earnings.However, the severe winter weather in Devon’s service territories adversely impacted production volumes and the Williston Basin operation was most impacted by severe weather conditions. Due to the impact of weather, Devon’s production volumes in fourth-quarter will be lower than the previously expected range of 640,000-660,000 Boe/d.A high percentage of DVN’s fourth-quarter production volumes are liquids. To safeguard against the sudden fluctuation in commodity prices, Devon has hedged 20% of its production volume, which will safeguard it against price fluctuation.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter oil production is pegged at 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter natural gas liquid (NGL) production is pegged at 158,000 Boe/d.Devon Energy expects total production for the fourth quarter to be 636,000 Boe/d, including 316,000 barrels of oil per day. The company lowered its fourth-quarter production expectation by 2% or 15,000 Boe/d due to the impact of severe winter weather across its operations.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Devon Energy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Devon Energy Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseDevon Energy Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseDevon Energy Corporation price-eps-surprise | Devon Energy Corporation QuoteStory continuesEarnings ESP: Devon Energy has an Earnings ESP of -3.49%.

The figure is lower than the prior week’s count of 771. Thus, since June 2020, the upstream energy players have cut the count of oil and gas rigs by the most. The current national rig count is, however, higher than the year-ago level of 613.The onshore rigs in the week ended Feb 3 totaled 745, lower than the prior week's count of 756. In offshore resources, 12 rigs were operating, lower than the prior week’s count of 13.U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls: The oil rig count was 599 in the week ended Feb 3, lower than the prior-week figure of 609. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is, however, up from the year-ago figure of 497.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Decreases: Natural gas rig count of 158 is lower than the prior-week figure of 160. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is, however, higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 116. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.2% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 21 units, in line with the prior-week count. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 738 is lower than the prior-week level of 750.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Falls: GoM rig count was 12 units, all oil-directed. The count was lower than the prior-week number of 13.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 345, lower than the prior week's count of 350. The tally increased in four of the prior 10 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $70-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG can reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Devon Energy is a well-known upstream energy firm with a strong multi-basin portfolio. Delaware basin is among the basins that contribute significant oil equivalent production to DVN.The Zacks Rank #3 firm, Devon Energy, has a prolific multi-decade inventory, suggesting a solid production outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

339,30398153-90ed-3511-a126-29d7dbba2509,YUM,2023-02-07,Denny's (DENN) Q4 Earnings Preview: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dennys-denn-q4-earnings-preview-150003553.html,1675695603,STORY,"['DENN', 'YUM']","[The market expects Denny's (DENN) to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis restaurant operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $120.67 million, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Denny's?For Denny's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Denny's will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Denny's would post earnings of $0.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -14.29%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Denny's doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Yum Brands (YUM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +22.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.93 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Yum has been revised 1.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.85%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:YUM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-yum-140016470.html,1675692016,STORY,['YUM'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$131 and falling to the lows of US$117. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Yum! Brands' current trading price of US$127 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Yum! Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands What's The Opportunity In Yum! Brands?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 27.86x is currently well-above the industry average of 19.38x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. In addition to this, it seems like Yum! Brands’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Yum! Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 30% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Yum! Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? YUM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe YUM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on YUM for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for YUM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Yum! Brands at this point in time. For example, Yum! Brands has 3 warning signs (and 2 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Yum!

While downgrades and lowered price targets dominated REIT news last year, more analysts have been upgrading them since the beginning of 2023.Analysts have also been increasing their price targets on REITs in subsectors across the board. Even when analysts maintain rather than upgrade the stocks, they are still raising price estimates.Take a look at three REITs that are benefitting from recent price target hikes:SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is an office REIT — and the largest office landlord in New York City. It owns, leases and manages 61 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet.SL Green lost half its value in 2022 and has been unloved by analysts for many months, with four consecutive misses on revenue estimates from the third quarter of 2021 to second quarter of 2022. Fears of office vacancies from increasing work-from-home preference among many workers since the COVID-19 pandemic also pushed prices lower. Less than a month ago Mizuho analyst Vikram Malhotra lowered the price target for SL Green from $48 to $38 while maintaining a Neutral rating.But on Jan. 30, Robert W. Baird analyst David Rogers maintained his Neutral rating on SL Green while raising his price target from $38 to $43, a significant 13% increase.That price hike caught Wall Street’s attention, and SL Green stormed up 4.73% the following day. Part of that may have been a short squeeze as SL Green has a short interest level of 11.67%.SL Green Realty also recently announced fourth-quarter funds from operations (FFO) of $1.47, a penny below estimates, and revenue of $224.87 million, which beat estimates by $30.13 million. SL Green Realty also said it had signed leases for 343,186 square feet during the first few weeks of 2023. With these positives, SL Green had an amazing total return of 21.43% in January.Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages nearly 5,500 industrial logistics properties across the U.S. and in 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, Prologis has been a stalwart in appreciation among REIT stocks. It has the largest market capitalization of any REIT at $119.336 billion.Story continuesOn Jan. 18, Prologis reported fourth-quarter 2022 operating results. Net earnings per diluted share for 2022 was $4.25, compared with $3.94 for the fourth quarter of 2021. However, net earnings per share of $0.63 was a large drop-off from $1.67 in the fourth quarter of 2021.Core funds from operations (Core FFO) were $1.24, compared with $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Core FFO for all of 2022 was $5.16, well above $4.15 for 2021. Average occupancy was 98.2%, with a retention rate of 82% and full-year rent growth of 28%.Since Jan. 23, Prologis has received significant analyst attention.Morgan Stanley increased the price target on Prologis from $121 to $128. Truist Securities hiked its price target from $135 to $140. BMO Capital Markets lifted its price target from $140 to $145, and Raymond James improved its price target from $130 to $145. Only Barclays dropped its price target on Prologis, and that was from $162 to $160, well above these other estimates.Prologis also had a prolific January, with a total gain of 14.72%.National Retail Properties Inc. (NYSE: NNN) is a net-lease REIT that owns a diversified group of stand-alone retail outlets across the U.S. National Retail Properties has a stable tenant base, with names like 7-Eleven Inc., Sunoco LP, Best Buy Co. Inc., Camping World Holdings Inc., BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. and Chuck E. Cheese.On Jan. 27, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. analyst Tyler Batory raised his price target on National Retail Properties from $49 to $54, while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock.On Jan. 19, RBC Royal Bank lifted its price target on National Retail Properties from $43 to $48, while maintaining a rating of Sector Perform.Earlier in the month, analyst Linda Tsai of Jefferies upgraded National Retail Properties from Hold to Buy, while markedly increasing the price target 23% from $42 to $52.National Retail Properties had a total return of 4.09% in January.

345,4a2d9642-9e55-3062-917d-99acf2b15401,PCAR,2023-02-07,PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 66% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-inc-nasdaq-pcar-favoured-120024808.html,1675771224,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Every investor in PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 66% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PACCAR, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for PACCAR ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PACCAR?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.PACCAR already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PACCAR, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PACCAR. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 4.1% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PACCARThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in PACCAR Inc. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$686m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 32% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PACCAR. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for PACCAR (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

(NYSE:UPS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-united-parcel-130022566.html,1675688422,STORY,['UPS'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Is United Parcel Service Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$8.65bUS$9.01bUS$9.22bUS$9.42bUS$9.61bUS$9.81bUS$10.0bUS$10.2bUS$10.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x11Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 2.09%Est @ 2.09%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$7.6kUS$7.4kUS$7.1kUS$6.7kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.6kUS$5.3kUS$5.0kUS$4.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$62bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$173bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$173b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$79bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$140b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$192, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.035. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Parcel ServiceStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For United Parcel Service, there are three fundamental items you should further examine:Risks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 is potentially serious!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does UPS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NYSE:ZBH) share price up 22% in a single quarter. But that doesn't help the fact that the three year return is less impressive. In fact, the share price is down 19% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years that the share price fell, Zimmer Biomet Holdings' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 37% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 7% compound annual share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in. With a P/E ratio of 92.94, it's fair to say the market sees a brighter future for the business.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Zimmer Biomet Holdings' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Zimmer Biomet Holdings the TSR over the last 3 years was -15%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Zimmer Biomet Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 11% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Zimmer Biomet Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Zimmer Biomet Holdings , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty Ulta Beauty's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Ulta Beauty has grown EPS by 25% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Ulta Beauty achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 20% to US$9.7b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Ulta Beauty's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Ulta Beauty Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$26b company like Ulta Beauty. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$123m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.5% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Ulta Beauty, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.Ulta Beauty offered total compensation worth US$8.5m to its CEO in the year to January 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Ulta Beauty Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Ulta Beauty's strong EPS growth. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Ulta Beauty look rather interesting indeed.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Ulta Beauty (ULTA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ULTA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Ulta Beauty's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Ulta Beauty's main business drivers.Bolingbrook, IL-based, Ulta Beauty Inc., previously known as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &amp; Fragrance, Inc., is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. Founded in 1990, the company changed its name to Ulta Beauty in January 2017.The company offers a wide range of products including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. It sells more than 25,000 products from about 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points. We note that the company's skincare category has been standing out in particular for a while now, given consumers' rising consciousness.Meanwhile, the beauty products retailer also provides private label products comprising Ulta Beauty Collection branded cosmetics, skincare, and bath products. Additionally, the company operates a full-service salon in every store offering hair, skin and brow services. Additionally, it offers products through its Website, ulta.com, as well as mobile applications. The products offered by the company include the prestige and mass beauty brands.As part of its value proposition, Ulta Beauty provides a range of loyalty programs through its Customer Relationship Management platform. It also offers frequent promotions, coupons, in-store events and gifts. The company also makes use of a range of media platforms to advertise products as well as generate awareness. The company strives to boost distribution center capabilities to better support store footfall and online demand.Story continuesThe company has a strong vendor base and holds partnerships with companies such as Estee Lauder, L’Oréal and Shiseido. Ulta Beauty works closely with vendors to provide improved growth platforms for new and existing brands.As of Oct 29, 2022, Ulta Beauty operated 1,343 stores. For fiscal 2022, the company expects 47 net new stores and 33 store remodeling and relocation projects.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Ulta Beauty ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in February 2013 would be worth $5,338.94, or a gain of 433.89%, as of February 6, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 173.37% and the price of gold increased 7.10% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ULTA too.Ulta Beauty has outpaced the industry in the past three months. The company has been benefiting from its omnichannel strength, especially buy online, pickup in store. Also, the skin care category has been gaining from consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s product newness. These upsides aided third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed growth in all major categories, and all its store and digital channels. Ulta Beauty also saw a higher market share in prestige beauty compared with the year-ago period. Considering the third-quarter performance and anticipations for the fourth quarter, management raised its fiscal 2022 view. However, it expects SG&amp;A deleverage and increased supply-chain costs to persist in fiscal 2022.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 7.11%, and there have been 2 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower.

Regeneron delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though lead drug Eylea sales declined. Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD too beat on both earnings and sales on continued solid demand for its HIV portfolio and oncology franchise, driven by the cell therapy franchise and Trodelvy.Per the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry comes under the broader Medical sector, which comprises pharma/biotech as well as medical device companies.Per the Earnings Trends report, as of Feb 1, 28.6% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting nearly 51.1% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Trikafta sales are pegged at $2.04 billion and $1.99 billion, respectively. Sales of Trikafta in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been driven by strong uptakes in international markets and increased drug adoption in the United States among pediatric patients (6-11 years of age).Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3, currently.

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.67%.Coming into today, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had lost 5.63% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 8.32%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 14, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.45, unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $9.98 billion, up 5.44% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.4.Also, we should mention that KO has a PEG ratio of 3.77.

377,431fae4f-9d0a-3b19-b7d6-e363a91754d8,KO,2023-02-07,Here's Why PepsiCo (PEP) Looks Poised for Earnings Beat in Q4,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-pepsico-pep-looks-153803659.html,1675697883,STORY,"['PEP', 'KO', 'SAM', 'K']","[PepsiCo, Inc. PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 numbers on Feb 9, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $26.85 billion, implying 6.3% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.64, suggesting 7.2% growth from the $1.53 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter total revenues to increase 1.4% year over year to $26,347.5 million and adjusted earnings per share to improve 5.2% year over year to $1.61. For 2022, we estimate year-over-year revenue growth of 5.6% to $84,743.5 million, with year-over-year earnings growth of 7.5% to $6.73 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 6.5%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NotePepsiCo looks well-poised for growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. The company is likely to have benefited from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands.The company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from investments in brands, go-to-market systems, supply chains, manufacturing capacity and digital capabilities to build competitive advantages.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, Ready-to-Drink Tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation, pricing and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo is expected to have witnessed margin pressures in the fourth quarter, driven by the impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation, and commodity costs. In the last reported quarter, PEP anticipated incremental input cost inflation for the balance of 2022. This indicates continued cost inflation effects in the fourth quarter. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around.

MHK is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 9, after market close.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined 15.4% year over year. Net sales lagged the consensus estimate by 4.6% but increased 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.MHK’s earnings surpassed expectations in nine of the trailing 10 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mohawk’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.29 per share, indicating a 56.3% decline from the prior-year reported figure of $2.95. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $2.73 billion, suggesting a 1% decrease from the year-ago reported figure of $2.76 billion.Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMohawk Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mohawk Industries, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteMohawk’s sales in fourth-quarter 2022 are expected to have slowed down, owing to softness in the housing industry and remodeling activities. Higher interest rates and inflationary pressure have been moderating demand for homes, impacting consumer discretionary spending. Also, residential remodeling is softening as consumers have been deferring their home improvement projects.In Europe, dramatically variable natural gas prices and constrained supply are reducing economic growth. Mohawk has been witnessing inflation in most product categories. Also, the availability of material, labor and transportation has been challenging, thereby inflating costs. Especially tight chemical supplies are hurting the output of LVT, carpet, laminate and board panels. These inflationary pressures are likely to significantly weigh on fourth-quarter bottom line results.MHK expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings (excluding restructuring charges) in the range of $1.40-$1.50 per share. We expect adjusted earnings to decrease 56.4% year over year to $1.29 per share.For the to-be-reported quarter, we expect Global Ceramic revenues to increase 0.5%. Flooring NA revenues is likely to decline 5.7% and Flooring ROW is expected to be down 7.3% year over year.The consensus mark for revenues from the Global Ceramic unit is pegged at $1,013 million, implying a 6.6% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for the Flooring NA segment’s net sales is pegged at $1,006 million, indicating a decrease of 1% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues from Flooring ROW is pegged at $738 million, suggesting a 7.3% decline from the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for Global Ceramic, Flooring NA and Flooring ROW businesses’ adjusted operating income suggests a decline of 10%, 65.1% and 54.4%, respectively, from a year ago period.That said, Mohawk has undertaken certain actions across the enterprise to reduce costs. In Flooring NA, it has rationalized some older, less efficient fiber assets and reduced rug manufacturing capacity. In Flooring ROW, it is consolidating insulation products and streamlining organization. In Ceramic Europe, it is simplifying the administrative and manufacturing organizations. These actions are likely to have benefited the company in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mohawk this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Management believes that Non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Incyte’s GAAP disclosures. Management uses such information internally and externally for establishing budgets, operating goals and financial planning purposes. These metrics are also used to manage the Company’s business and monitor performance. The Company adjusts, where appropriate, for expenses in order to reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company believes these adjustments are useful to investors by providing an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core operations. The metrics have been adopted to align the Company with disclosures provided by industry peers.Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used in conjunction with and to supplement Incyte’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in our industry.As changes in exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, Management believes the presentation of certain revenue results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand its operating results and evaluate its performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current year results using prior year foreign currency exchange rates and generally refers to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Quite a few are scheduled to report later in the week. Bellwether Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Swiss pharma giant Novartis beat on earnings but missed on revenues. Among the biotechs, Amgen and Bristol Myers beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Regeneron delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though lead drug Eylea sales declined. Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD too beat on both earnings and sales on continued solid demand for its HIV portfolio and oncology franchise, driven by the cell therapy franchise and Trodelvy.Per the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry comes under the broader Medical sector, which comprises pharma/biotech as well as medical device companies.Per the Earnings Trends report, as of Feb 1, 28.6% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting nearly 51.1% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings. While 81.3% beat earnings estimates, 62.5% beat the same for sales. Earnings increased 3.6% year over year on 7.6% higher revenues. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the Medical sector are expected to decline 9% on a 4.3% sales increase.Let’s analyze three drug/biotech companies — Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, Incyte INCY and Exelixis EXEL — that are set to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 7.Vertex PharmaceuticalsVertex has a pretty impressive track record having beaten earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it beat earnings expectations by 8.67%. It surpassed earnings estimates by 3.16%, on average, in the last four quarters. The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -1.54% and a Zacks Rank #3.Per our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) have a good chance of delivering an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesVertex’s revenue growth in fourth-quarter 2022 is likely to have been driven by the rapid uptake of its blockbuster cystic fibrosis (CF) medicine, Trikafta/Kaftrio (Trikafta’s brand name in Europe). The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Trikafta sales are pegged at $2.04 billion and $1.99 billion, respectively.

Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer, commented: ""Winter Storm Elliott impacted policyholders in 44 states and Washington, D.C. The timing of the storm was particularly influential as many businesses were closed and families were traveling for the holiday, delaying discovery and reporting of losses.""It's rare for us to experience a catastrophe of Elliott's magnitude in the fourth quarter. Our standard property casualty and excess and surplus businesses recorded $158 million in losses from this storm, while Cincinnati Re® and Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd.SM recorded $3 million in total. Catastrophe losses contributed 7.8 points to the quarter, twice as high as our fourth-quarter five-year average, pushing our fourth-quarter combined ratio to 94.9%.""On a full-year basis, our combined ratio was 98.1%, within our long-term target of 95-100%, and marking 11 years in a row of underwriting profit.""Diversified Growth in a Challenging Market""For the first-time ever, new business written by our independent agents surpassed $1 billion. Strong pricing and exposure growth across our insurance business combined to support a second consecutive year of double-digit net written premium growth. While we continued to focus on pricing sophistication and segmentation to exercise underwriting discipline, full-year 2022 growth of 13% is our highest result since 2001.""We are employing a number of strategies to maintain diversified, profitable growth, including: growing our management liability and surety book – which topped $300 million in written premiums for 2022; adding CinergySM, our small-business platform, to new states; writing excess and surplus lines homeowner policies in California and Florida; and participating in a firming property insurance market through Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.""Positive Momentum Heading into 2023""We enter 2023 from a position of strength: our personal insurance business has recorded four consecutive years of underwriting profit; our commercial insurance business has enjoyed 11 years of underwriting profit; our excess and surplus lines company has achieved a combined ratio in the low-90s or better every year since 2012; and our life insurance company contributed record-high earnings of $66 million in 2022. While our commercial umbrella business was challenged during 2022, its five-year average combined ratio through 2022 was below 85%.""Cash flow produced by our insurance business continues to fuel investment income as we grew pretax investment income 9% to a record-high $781 million.""The board of directors expressed their confidence in our future by declaring a dividend increase in January. Our value creation ratio captures the dividends we pay along with changes in our book value. On a five-year average basis through 2022, we've achieved an 11.2% VCR – in line with our long-term target of 10-13%.""Insurance Operations HighlightsConsolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results(Dollars in millions)Three months ended December 31,Twelve months ended December 31,20222021% Change20222021% ChangeEarned premiums$ 1,800$ 1,59913$ 6,924$ 6,18412Fee revenues22010100 Total revenues1,8021,601136,9346,19412Loss and loss expenses1,172855374,7163,59631Underwriting expenses537490102,0781,86711 Underwriting profit $ 93$ 256(64)$ 140$ 731(81)Ratios as a percent of earned premiums:Pt.

Grainger GWW, Olympic Steel ZEUS, AllianceBernstein AB, Valero Energy VLO and Phillips 66 PSX.Bet on DuPont Analyst and Pick Up 5 Top StocksReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and the capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below, we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running.

392,7dab8045-7f72-3dc9-bd5e-de57e67257ac,REG,2023-02-07,Is a Beat in Store for Regency (REG) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beat-store-regency-reg-earnings-142402042.html,1675693442,STORY,"['REG', 'FRT']","[Regency Centers Corp. REG is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 9 after the closing bell. While the company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year revenue growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share might decline.In the last reported quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a negative surprise of 1.05% in terms of NAREIT FFO per share. The results reflected healthy leasing activity and year-over-year improvement in base rent. However, same-property net operating income (NOI) fell year over year.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s FFO per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same in the remaining quarter, the average beat being 5.04%. This is depicted in the graph below:Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation price-eps-surprise | Regency Centers Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail real estate markets remained robust in the fourth quarter, with resilient demand driving the retail availability rate to 4.9% after hitting a high of 6.6% in fourth-quarter 2020.The core retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, gasoline and auto parts, climbed 7.1% from the prior-year period. The non-store retail sales, which include e-commerce, grew 11.3% year over year.The retail asking rent improved 2.5% year over year for the second consecutive quarter to $22.78 per square foot in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by strong demand and limited new supply.Retail space absorption came in at 12.7 million square feet for fourth-quarter 2022, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of positive retail absorption per the CBRE Group report.Regency is anticipated to have benefited from the above-mentioned factors.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Amis this, the demand for REG’s high-quality open-air shopping center portfolio in the affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States, having strong demand drivers, is likely to have aided its fourth-quarter cashflows.Moreover, with more people moving into the suburbs due to the post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is expected to have benefited.Additionally, 80% of REG’s portfolio comprises grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. The company also has a good tenant mix, with several industry-leading grocers.REG’s top line is expected to have improved amid these tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $305.2 million, indicating an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Furthermore, Regency’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its acquisition and development activities during the fourth quarter.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REG’s fourth-quarter FFO per share has been revised a penny upward to 98 cents over the past two months. However, the same implies a 2.97% decline year over year.For 2022, Regency had projected NAREIT FFO per share to lie in the range of $4.00-$4.03.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been revised 1% upward to $4.03 over the past two months. The figure also indicates a marginal growth year over year on revenues of $1.25 billion.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for REG this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. That is just the case here.Earnings ESP: Regency has an Earnings ESP of +0.47%.

393,70aa22fd-b8a9-3ee6-b794-5331d6e1f584,LKQ,2023-02-07,3 Auto Stocks Poised to Deliver Q4 Earnings Beat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-auto-stocks-poised-deliver-143602626.html,1675694162,STORY,"['LKQ', 'ALSN', 'RIVN']","[We are entering the peak of the fourth-quarter earnings season for the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the picture thus far looks pretty decent despite supply chain issues and economic worries that the space is grappling with. So far this earnings season, five S&amp;P sector components — namely Tesla, PACCAR, General Motors, Ford and Cummins have come up with quarterly numbers. Tesla, PACCAR and General Motors not only managed to pull off a comprehensive beat but also witnessed year-over-year growth in the top and the bottom lines. Meanwhile, Ford and Cummins missed earnings estimates but witnessed year-over-year growth in profits and sales.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified a few auto players — Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN, LKQ Corp LKQ, Rivian Automotive RIVN — which are positioned to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings.What’s Shaping the Q4 Earnings Season for Auto Stocks?The fourth quarter of 2022 was a mixed bag for the auto space, with some automakers witnessing a year-over-year increase in the number of vehicles sold while others saw a decline. In general, what aided the industry was the gradual abatement of chip woes and a slight improvement in supply chain systems. As such, inventory levels were on the rise. Inventory levels in December were more than one million units for the third consecutive month, per J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. Per TrueCar, the total new light-vehicle inventory, including fleet and commercial vehicles, totaled 1.8 million in December 2022, up from 1.1 million recorded in December 2021.Despite economic uncertainty, demand for vehicles largely managed to show resilience during the last three months of 2022. The rising deliveries of new energy vehicles (including all-electric, hybrids and fuel-cell) are expected to have fueled revenues. However, for the less-affluent and subprime consumers, the rising cost of financing is expected to have played spoilsport. Per estimates of J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, average interest rates for new vehicle loans were up around 250 basis points from the year-ago levels. High interest rates eat away vehicle buyers' willingness and ability to purchase. This may have limited revenues to some extent.Story continuesAs for the average price of vehicles, used car prices are on a decline, while new car prices during the quarter under discussion have remained high. High new vehicle prices are likely to have offset commodity cost inflation partially. High costs of raw materials, manufacturing inefficiency, rising freight and fuel costs may have limited margins.Per the latest Earnings Trend report dated Feb 1, the auto sector’s earnings for Q4 are expected to grow 62.1% on a year-over-year basis. As for revenues, they are estimated to rise 21.4% year over year.Picking Potential WinnersWhile it is not possible to be sure about which companies are well positioned to beat earnings estimates, our proprietary methodology — Earnings ESP — makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, the chances of an earnings beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesBelow we list three auto stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off a beat this earnings season.Allison: Strategic buyouts and frequent product launches are likely to aid Allison’s upcoming results. FracTran, TerraTran and 3414 Regional Haul Series along with Allison’s eGen Power portfolio are likely to have secured business wins, thereby aiding fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from ALSN’s North America On-Highway segment is pegged at $327 million, up from $281 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company’s upbeat 2022 projections also spark optimism for the upcoming quarter’s results.Allison has an Earnings ESP of +3.06% and a Zacks Rank #3. This auto equipment provider is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Allison’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.21 per share and $676 million, respectively. ALSN surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other, with the average surprise being 10.3%.Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. QuoteLKQ: The increase in the average age of vehicles (12.2 years according to IHS Markit data) is likely to have positively impacted sales of LKQ’s products. For the smooth functioning of aging vehicles, customers have been spending heavily to replace any faulty parts and components. This is expected to have boosted LKQ’s revenues. The firm’s upcoming results are anticipated to reflect benefits from pricing initiatives in North America and restructuring efforts in Europe.LKQ has an Earnings ESP of +3.78% and a Zacks Rank #3. This auto replacement parts provider is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 84 cents per share and $3.01 billion, respectively.

Procter &amp; Gamble research shows men shower 2x more, apply deodorant 30% more frequently, and are 30% more likely to experience malodor than women. The Smelf-Confidence campaign highlights the everyday challenges guys must overcome while effortlessly avoiding the pitfalls of BO. Fortunately, the Old Spice Swagger collection provides 24/7 long-lasting freshness*.""Old Spice wants guys everywhere to feel confident when under the spotlight,"" said Matt Krehbiel, Old Spice’s Vice President at Procter &amp; Gamble. ""This new campaign is inspired by the insight that we can usually count on others to tell us if something is out of place. Maybe we have something in our teeth, or a spot on our shirt, but no one will tell us if we smell, leaving us wondering in those make-or-break moments, ‘do I smell right now?’ If you can’t be confident that others will tell you that you smell bad, then you need to be really confident in your grooming products.""Created by Wieden + Kennedy (Portland), the Broadway-inspired ad spots feature Manuel Pacific (Terminator: Dark Fate, Ride). A Colombian-born actor, Manuel is no stranger to the spotlight, performing on international stages since the age of 7. The first spot, ""Soliloquy,"" will begin airing on national television along with YouTube, Vevo, TikTok, and Reddit. The second spot, ""Tango,"" will premiere later this spring.Story continuesMake Room for Swaggy Spice, Old Spice’s First-Ever MascotSpeaking of keeping it cool and fresh under the spotlight, Old Spice is introducing the freshest, campaign-inspired mascot, Swaggy Spice. Mascots have to do it all - dance, dunk and make us laugh - all while under the spotlight of thousands of fans. However, what people don’t realize is mascots can sweat up to 10 pounds per game, making them the stinkiest thing in the stadium. What better way to pressure test Old Spice Swagger’s 24/7 long-lasting freshness than in one of the sweatiest conditions – a mascot costume in Phoenix? Decked out in stylish accessories, Swaggy Spice will deliver the same odor/sweat protection to the masses at one of the most stressful, high-intensity events of the year, the Super Bowl.""It’s a real honor to become THE most famous deodorant stick of all time and spread the word about my 24/7 long-lasting freshness,"" said Swaggy Spice, the official mascot of Old Spice. ""I always had big dreams thanks to my confidence-inducing fragrance and odor protection but never expected to reach the pinnacle of deodorant stardom with Old Spice. Shout out to my good-smelling friends and family who believed in me as a young deodorant stick with one dream…to deliver Smelf-Confidence to guys everywhere.""During his surprise appearances this week, Swaggy Spice will hand out samples, engage fans around Phoenix, and walk the Super Bowl LVII red carpets with celebrity handlers.Old Spice Swagger LineupOld Spice Swagger lineup is back with newly-designed packaging and the famed Old Spice odor and sweat fighting technology that gives 24/7 freshness to those who use it every day.

396,4cf601a7-baa7-335d-817b-27baf73418cd,SLG,2023-02-07,Analysts Recently Raised Price Targets on Several REITs,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-recently-raised-price-targets-182020870.html,1675707620.0,STORY,"['TGT', 'SLG-PI', 'PLD', 'NNN']","[In a turnaround from 2022, analysts have again begun to show improved regard for real estate investment trusts (REITs). While downgrades and lowered price targets dominated REIT news last year, more analysts have been upgrading them since the beginning of 2023.Analysts have also been increasing their price targets on REITs in subsectors across the board. Even when analysts maintain rather than upgrade the stocks, they are still raising price estimates.Take a look at three REITs that are benefitting from recent price target hikes:SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is an office REIT — and the largest office landlord in New York City. It owns, leases and manages 61 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet.SL Green lost half its value in 2022 and has been unloved by analysts for many months, with four consecutive misses on revenue estimates from the third quarter of 2021 to second quarter of 2022. Fears of office vacancies from increasing work-from-home preference among many workers since the COVID-19 pandemic also pushed prices lower. Less than a month ago Mizuho analyst Vikram Malhotra lowered the price target for SL Green from $48 to $38 while maintaining a Neutral rating.But on Jan. 30, Robert W. Baird analyst David Rogers maintained his Neutral rating on SL Green while raising his price target from $38 to $43, a significant 13% increase.That price hike caught Wall Street’s attention, and SL Green stormed up 4.73% the following day. Part of that may have been a short squeeze as SL Green has a short interest level of 11.67%.SL Green Realty also recently announced fourth-quarter funds from operations (FFO) of $1.47, a penny below estimates, and revenue of $224.87 million, which beat estimates by $30.13 million. SL Green Realty also said it had signed leases for 343,186 square feet during the first few weeks of 2023. With these positives, SL Green had an amazing total return of 21.43% in January.Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages nearly 5,500 industrial logistics properties across the U.S. and in 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, Prologis has been a stalwart in appreciation among REIT stocks. It has the largest market capitalization of any REIT at $119.336 billion.Story continuesOn Jan. 18, Prologis reported fourth-quarter 2022 operating results. Net earnings per diluted share for 2022 was $4.25, compared with $3.94 for the fourth quarter of 2021. However, net earnings per share of $0.63 was a large drop-off from $1.67 in the fourth quarter of 2021.Core funds from operations (Core FFO) were $1.24, compared with $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Core FFO for all of 2022 was $5.16, well above $4.15 for 2021. Average occupancy was 98.2%, with a retention rate of 82% and full-year rent growth of 28%.Since Jan. 23, Prologis has received significant analyst attention.Morgan Stanley increased the price target on Prologis from $121 to $128. Truist Securities hiked its price target from $135 to $140. BMO Capital Markets lifted its price target from $140 to $145, and Raymond James improved its price target from $130 to $145. Only Barclays dropped its price target on Prologis, and that was from $162 to $160, well above these other estimates.Prologis also had a prolific January, with a total gain of 14.72%.National Retail Properties Inc. (NYSE: NNN) is a net-lease REIT that owns a diversified group of stand-alone retail outlets across the U.S. National Retail Properties has a stable tenant base, with names like 7-Eleven Inc., Sunoco LP, Best Buy Co. Inc., Camping World Holdings Inc., BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. and Chuck E. Cheese.On Jan. 27, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. analyst Tyler Batory raised his price target on National Retail Properties from $49 to $54, while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock.On Jan. 19, RBC Royal Bank lifted its price target on National Retail Properties from $43 to $48, while maintaining a rating of Sector Perform.Earlier in the month, analyst Linda Tsai of Jefferies upgraded National Retail Properties from Hold to Buy, while markedly increasing the price target 23% from $42 to $52.National Retail Properties had a total return of 4.09% in January. It will announce fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 7.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO enables investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. A reconciliation from net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders to AFFO is provided on Attachment 2.Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment, plus preferred dividends.Management considers Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as Consolidated EBITDAre – adjusted for non-recurring items divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment.Management considers Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs.

Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items is defined as EBITDAre excluding the impact of income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures and other non-recurring items including, but not limited to casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net of wholly owned communities.Management considers Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Controllable Expenses: The Company refers to property operating and maintenance expenses as Controllable Expenses.Controllable Operating Margin: The Company defines Controllable Operating Margin as (i) rental income less Controllable Expenses (ii) divided by rental income. Management considers Controllable Operating Margin a useful metric as it provides investors with an indicator of the Company’s ability to limit the growth of expenses that are within the control of the Company.Development Communities: The Company defines Development Communities as those communities recently developed or under development by the Company, that are currently majority owned by the Company and have not achieved stabilization as of the most recent quarter.Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre): The Company defines EBITDAre as net income/(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), plus interest expense, including costs associated with debt extinguishment, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, plus other depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) income tax provision/(benefit), net, (minus) plus net gain/(loss) on the sale of depreciable real estate owned, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus the adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the Nareit definition, or that interpret the Nareit definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre was approved by the Board of Governors of Nareit in September 2017.Management considers EBITDAre a useful metric for investors as it provides an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt, and enables investors to assess our performance against that of its peer REITs. EBITDAre should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company’s activities in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAre does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and EBITDAre is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth as the combined proportional growth as a result of Effective New Lease Rate Growth and Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth.

FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. A reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO as Adjusted is provided on Attachment 2.Funds from Operations (""FFO"") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders: The Company defines FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the Company or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the Company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and the Company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's definition issued in April 2002 and restated in November 2018. In the computation of diluted FFO, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, unvested LTIP Units, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.Management considers FFO a useful metric for investors as the Company uses FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company's activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.

Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as 3.25% of property revenue, and land rent. Property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations, inclusive of corporate management, regional supervision, accounting and other costs.Management considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations.

401,4b9e94ab-7ac2-351f-99ff-137e9c13c9c3,ORLY,2023-02-07,Advance Auto Parts (AAP) to Report Q4 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advance-auto-parts-aap-report-150003933.html,1675695603,STORY,"['AAP', 'ORLY']","[Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto parts retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.4%.Revenues are expected to be $2.43 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Advance Auto Parts?For Advance Auto Parts, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Advance Auto Parts will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Advance Auto Parts would post earnings of $3.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.84, delivering a surprise of -14.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Advance Auto Parts doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is soon expected to post earnings of $7.71 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.52 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for O'Reilly Automotive has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.38%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that O'Reilly Automotive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Public Storage (PSA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4 a share 15 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 21, 2023.Public Storage's Earnings ESP sits at 0.22%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99.PSA is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Aflac (AFL) as well.Slated to report earnings on April 26, 2023, Aflac holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.40 a share 79 days from its next quarterly update.Aflac's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.94% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37.Story continuesPSA and AFL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

REG is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 9 after the closing bell. While the company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year revenue growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share might decline.In the last reported quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a negative surprise of 1.05% in terms of NAREIT FFO per share. The results reflected healthy leasing activity and year-over-year improvement in base rent. However, same-property net operating income (NOI) fell year over year.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s FFO per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same in the remaining quarter, the average beat being 5.04%. This is depicted in the graph below:Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation price-eps-surprise | Regency Centers Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail real estate markets remained robust in the fourth quarter, with resilient demand driving the retail availability rate to 4.9% after hitting a high of 6.6% in fourth-quarter 2020.The core retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, gasoline and auto parts, climbed 7.1% from the prior-year period. The non-store retail sales, which include e-commerce, grew 11.3% year over year.The retail asking rent improved 2.5% year over year for the second consecutive quarter to $22.78 per square foot in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by strong demand and limited new supply.Retail space absorption came in at 12.7 million square feet for fourth-quarter 2022, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of positive retail absorption per the CBRE Group report.Regency is anticipated to have benefited from the above-mentioned factors.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Amis this, the demand for REG’s high-quality open-air shopping center portfolio in the affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States, having strong demand drivers, is likely to have aided its fourth-quarter cashflows.Moreover, with more people moving into the suburbs due to the post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is expected to have benefited.Additionally, 80% of REG’s portfolio comprises grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. The company also has a good tenant mix, with several industry-leading grocers.REG’s top line is expected to have improved amid these tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $305.2 million, indicating an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Furthermore, Regency’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its acquisition and development activities during the fourth quarter.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REG’s fourth-quarter FFO per share has been revised a penny upward to 98 cents over the past two months. However, the same implies a 2.97% decline year over year.For 2022, Regency had projected NAREIT FFO per share to lie in the range of $4.00-$4.03.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been revised 1% upward to $4.03 over the past two months. The figure also indicates a marginal growth year over year on revenues of $1.25 billion.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for REG this season.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Alliant Energy:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.05 = US$892m ÷ (US$20b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Alliant Energy has an ROCE of 5.0%. Even though it's in line with the industry average of 4.6%, it's still a low return by itself. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy roceIn the above chart we have measured Alliant Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Alliant Energy.The Trend Of ROCEThe returns on capital haven't changed much for Alliant Energy in recent years. The company has employed 41% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 5.0%. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.The Bottom LineAs we've seen above, Alliant Energy's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 62% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Alliant Energy (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  you should be aware of.While Alliant Energy may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 numbers on Feb 9, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $26.85 billion, implying 6.3% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.64, suggesting 7.2% growth from the $1.53 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter total revenues to increase 1.4% year over year to $26,347.5 million and adjusted earnings per share to improve 5.2% year over year to $1.61. For 2022, we estimate year-over-year revenue growth of 5.6% to $84,743.5 million, with year-over-year earnings growth of 7.5% to $6.73 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 6.5%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NotePepsiCo looks well-poised for growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. The company is likely to have benefited from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands.The company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from investments in brands, go-to-market systems, supply chains, manufacturing capacity and digital capabilities to build competitive advantages.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, Ready-to-Drink Tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation, pricing and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo is expected to have witnessed margin pressures in the fourth quarter, driven by the impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation, and commodity costs. In the last reported quarter, PEP anticipated incremental input cost inflation for the balance of 2022. This indicates continued cost inflation effects in the fourth quarter. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around.

These advancements demonstrate progress towards realizing the full vision of the Cisco Security Cloud which will protect the integrity of an organization's entire IT ecosystem.Cisco Logo (PRNewsfoto/Cisco)""Security products should provide a frictionless user experience while minimizing risk for the organization,"" said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Security and Collaboration at Cisco. ""At the same time, organizations need to look at their security resilience holistically. This is why Cisco is building an end-to-end portfolio of security solutions and integrating them into a single platform. We're excited to share the latest innovations across zero trust, application security, and secure connectivity as we build towards our vision.""Cisco also introduced initial findings from the first-ever Cybersecurity Readiness Index focused on five core pillars of security protection – identity, devices, network, applications, and data. While technology to secure devices is widely adopted, more progress is needed to protect identity, networks and applications.Zero TrustRespondents ranked identity and device management as two of the three top cybersecurity threats. Alongside the widespread adoption of technology like multi-factor authentication (MFA), criminals are increasingly targeting the solutions protecting users and devices.Story continuesUnfortunately, while we are seeing impressive levels of adoption when it comes to device protection, there is still much work to be done when it comes to identity. The highest level of readiness that companies have across the globe is in securing devices, with nearly half of companies placed in either the 'mature' (31 percent) or 'progressive' (13 percent) stages of adoption. On the other hand, significant progress is needed to meet the challenge of identity verification, with only 20 percent of organizations in the 'mature' category, and more than half falling into the 'beginner' (20 percent) or 'formative' (38 percent) stages. Not only are these attacks becoming more frequent and current risk-based signals are failing, but authentication controls are also inflexible, creating too much friction. Security gets in the way, creating usability issues. Several features of Duo Risk-Based Authentication designed to reduce user friction and increase security efficacy in a hybrid work world are now available:Users can now authenticate less often in trusted situations without compromising privacy. Remembered Devices and patent-pending Wi-Fi Fingerprint allow users to stay logged in when using familiar applications, devices and networks – without collecting personal or private location information.Protect against authentication phishing attacks with the new Verified Push capability. In risky situations where Duo can recognize behavior from known attack patterns, it requires the user to enter a code, instead of just pushing a button to confirm.Expanded Single Sign On (SSO) capabilities that cater to modern enterprises and improve productivity by notifying and enabling users to reset their passwords before they expire.Application SecurityAccording to the Cybersecurity Readiness Index, companies urgently need to act on the security posture of their applications and related workloads. Only 12 percent are in a state of mature application-security readiness, while 65 percent are in the early or formative stages. Cisco's application strategy aims to ensure greater resilience against the growing attack surface of the experience economy where applications are no longer an adjunct, but rather they are the business itself.A significant advancement in its applications strategy, Cisco has announced the introduction of industry-first Business Risk Observability, an enhancement of Cisco's Full-Stack Observability application security solution. Available through Cisco Secure Application, which is integrated into Cisco AppDynamics, it provides a business risk scoring solution which brings together Kenna Risk Meter score distribution and Business Transactions from Cisco AppDynamics, and also integrates with Panoptica for API security and Talos for threat intelligence.Secure ConnectivityIT complexity, and the complexity of managing a highly distributed workforce has introduced risk to the organization and increased operational costs. Most enterprise networks can't support the change in traffic patterns driven by SaaS and hybrid work. Only 19 percent of companies are placed in the mature stage of protecting the network, while more than 50 percent are in the formative or beginner stages.To provide secure access to anything from anywhere - organizations are increasingly adopting Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architectures. Cisco is thrilled to announce that Cisco+ Secure Connect, the industry's first and leading unified single-vendor SASE solution, is extending support to Cisco SD-WAN powered by Viptela. Cisco+ Secure Connect uniquely converges Cisco SD-WAN fabrics and Cisco's leading cloud security services to provide secure access to anything from anywhere.Additional Resources:Blog: Cisco Secure at Cisco Live EMEA 2023Report: Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness IndexAbout CiscoCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet.

Price and EPS SurpriseFortinet, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFortinet, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Fortinet, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderFor the October-December quarter, Fortinet anticipates billings in the band of $1.665 billion-$1.720 billion. The heightened demand for its security and networking products amid the post-pandemic reality of remote working and the accelerated emergence of digital technologies might have benefited the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.The rapid adoption of FortiGate-based secure Software-Defined Wide Area Network (“SD-WAN”) offerings is likely to have supported Fortinet’s Product segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues in the December-end quarter stands at $534 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 40.9%.FortiGuard security subscriptions and FortiCare technical support services are likely to have gained solid traction, favoring the company’s Services segment.

This might have driven the company’s private and public cloud billings.Story continuesFortinet’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have gained from higher global cybersecurity spending. The growing adoption of SD-WAN solutions might have acted as a tailwind. Per Future Market Insights, the market size for SD-WAN solutions is likely to reach $53.8 billion by 2032 from $3.4 billion in 2022, witnessing a CAGR of 31.6% during the 2022-2032 period.However, worldwide supply-chain constraints, including the backlog in Fabric products, may have hurt FTNT’s overall fourth-quarter performance.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Fortinet this season.
