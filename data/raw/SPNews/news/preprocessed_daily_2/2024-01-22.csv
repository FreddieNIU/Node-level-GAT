However, that stock has been bid to nosebleed valuations, dramatically increasing the risk. It also means that investors may have a more lucrative opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).', ""It is not just that AMD's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12 compares well to the recent 31 P/S ratio of Nvidia. AMD has taken itself from the brink of bankruptcy to industry leader by successfully challenging companies like Nvidia and longtime rival Intel."", 'Moreover, the company has a huge opportunity in the AI chip market. Allied Market Research believes the AI chip market will grow to $384 billion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%, compared to a 6% CAGR over the same time frame for the overall semiconductor industry.', ""It has moved in this direction for a long time. When Lisa Su became CEO in 2014, she shifted AMD's focus to CPUs and GPUs. It so happens that the data centers that support AI depend heavily on both types of processors. The company successfully leveraged this core competency and took a lead over Intel in data center CPU market share growth in 2023."", ""Additionally, AMD has not surrendered the AI chip business to Nvidia. The AMD Instinct MI300 Series accelerators offer AI-ready technology. This includes the MI300A, an APU (accelerated processing unit) that combines the CPU and GPU in one unit. The company also designed the MI300X, claiming it is the world's most advanced generative AI accelerator."", 'Furthermore, the chip industry is coming out of a slump. To that end, analysts forecast a 41% increase in net income for the year.', ""Finally, the stock price increasingly reflects higher sales and optimism regarding the company's AI technology. Over the last year, AMD stock has risen about 125%, and that increase may be just the beginning as AMD capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom."", ""Jake Lerch (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft was, for a time, the biggest AI stock of them all, having passed Apple earlier this year to become the world's largest company with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion."", ""In large part, the surge in Microsoft's market cap can be credited to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI), and its ability to rapidly monetize those advancements."", 'Case in point: The company recently announced Copilot Pro, a $20/month package billed as a tool to help ""Supercharge your creativity and productivity."" According to the company, ""[Users will] gain priority access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo during peak times for accelerated performance to generate answers, content, and AI images even faster.""', 'Copilot Pro includes priority access to GPT-4 during peak hours, plus 100 Dall-E image boosts. Moreover, the Pro version also authorizes users to unlock AI-driven tools for Office software, allowing users to draft emails and create presentations using AI.', ""In short, Microsoft is quickly integrating AI advancements directly into its iconic software franchises -- and boosting its revenue in the process.

That's why Palantir's sales cycle has three phases. Its first phase, Acquire, is where organizations try the software at little to no cost. The latter phases, Expand and Scale, work its software deeper into organizations until they become mission-critical to how they operate."", ""This is important when considering Palantir's deep relationship with the U.S. government, arguably the only customer in the world with virtually bottomless pockets. The government is more than half of Palantir's revenue today, meaning government spending has grown with Palantir over the years. Palantir's AIP platform launched in 2023, and the system helps customers implement AI into their organizations. CEO Alex Karp has already cited\xa0customers' strong interest."", ""Both government and private sector competition seem to be moving toward a place where those who utilize their data will perform the best.

TSMC, in particular, experienced a remarkable increase of over 6% in Taiwan, while its American depository receipts saw an impressive surge of nearly 10%, reaching the highest closing level since February 2022. The noteworthy performance of TSMC has become a focal point, acting as a catalyst for heightened expectations of a global recovery within the semiconductor sector.

These discussions underscore the importance of staying informed about global economic dynamics and geopolitical factors that influence market trends.

The decline, unexpected by economists, hints at sustained job growth in January and contributes to an optimistic economic outlook, potentially complicating expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March. The strong performance is attributed to the resilience of the labor market, where companies are demonstrating reluctance to lay off workers amidst challenges in finding skilled labor, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Though some volatility in claims data is expected during the turn of the year, the overall trend aligns with a tight labor market. In the housing sector, single-family housing starts experienced an 8.6% decline in December, attributed in part to adverse weather conditions. However, the year-on-year increase of 15.8% indicates sustained demand, fueled by a shortage of existing homes for sale. Building permits for single-family homes rose by 1.7% to the highest level since May 2022, reflecting positive sentiment among homebuilders and responding to declining mortgage rates. While the housing market shows signs of resilience and increased demand for new construction, challenges persist, particularly in addressing the inventory shortage. The gap between housing starts and completion rates and the inventory gap in the market underscore the need for additional supply to alleviate the housing affordability crisis. Overall, these economic indicators provide a multifaceted view of the U.S. economy's current state, with both the labor market and the housing sector contributing to a generally positive narrative. Investors and analysts will closely monitor these trends for insights into economic resilience and potential policy implications."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bearish on The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Tesla, Inc.

That's because these companies deal with a type of design suite specifically for semiconductors that are so vital to AI's development. As a result, industry leaders Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) and Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS) have been off to the races, sporting respective gains of 59% and 71% since the start of 2023."", ""Synopsys stock has fallen as of late, though, on rumors it would try to acquire Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS), which produces software that analyzes and simulates engineered parts and systems before they're manufactured. Synopsys confirmed the rumor in late December and is offering to acquire Ansys for $35 billion. If successful, this will be one of the largest-ever tech mergers and acquisitions in a big bet on the future of AI. But investors should be aware of some important details before even considering buying right now."", 'On the surface, a tie-up between Synopsys and Ansys may look confusing. After all, Synopsys is a high-tech software business catering primarily to semiconductor companies and other businesses that design and assemble computing systems with chips. Ansys, by comparison, only counts about one-third of its revenue from semiconductor and computing customers. Its simulation software is primarily used for mechanical processes, not electrical ones.', ""But that isn't to say Ansys can't handle complex electrical design processes. In fact, as the companies said in the press release explaining the deal, all Ansys customers can benefit from having access to chip design software. That's because semiconductors are designed into products of all kinds these days, from cars to toothbrushes, and the trend isn't going to let up. On the contrary, with AI increasing the usefulness of embedded computing, many product companies are interested in putting AI to use but have limited AI and advanced software know-how."", ""That's the rationale for Synopsys-plus-Ansys. Together, the companies say their software suites have a total addressable market of $28 billion that's expected to grow at an average of 11% a year through 2028."", 'All this sounds exciting, but Synopsys shareholders should give pause here. Intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, and the deal likely not going through until well into 2025, are but minor concerns.', 'After news of the acquisition broke, Ansys stock spiked. The company is now valued at about a $29 billion market cap (lower than the mid-December valuation, in part due to uncertainty around merger approval). But even now, that values Ansys at a hefty 60 times trailing-12-month earnings and 46 times free cash flow.', 'To pay the premium price tag to Ansys shareholders, Synopsys has secured $16 billion in debt financing. That will blow up what was a squeaky-clean balance sheet that had $1.59 billion in cash and short-term investments and just $18 million in debt as of the last quarterly update.', ""Paying down this debt will be a top priority for Synopsys should it be successful in taking over Ansys. The company's long-standing stock repurchase program to return excess cash to shareholders is now suspended until then."", ""For the time being, the pending purchase of Ansys could keep a lid on Synopsys stock, which itself also trades for a high premium (64 times trailing-12-month earnings and 52 times free cash flow). The promise of AI development over the next decade is exciting and will likely spawn more merger and acquisition deals like this one. But investors should pause before buying the hype. Synopsys' bid for Ansys is all about the long term, putting healthy shareholder returns at risk over the next few years."", ""As an alternative, also keep an eye on Synopsys' chip design peer Cadence Design Systems. It, too, trades for a premium price, so consider using a dollar-cost averaging plan if you decide to buy at all."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Synopsys right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Synopsys, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Synopsys wasn't one of them.

For example, Altria (NYSE: MO), which for much of its history also owned what is now Philip Morris (NYSE: PM), was the best-performing stock on the market over a nearly 50-year period, according to Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel.', ""However, over the last decade, that's changed. Shares of tobacco companies like those two and British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI) have succumbed to pressure from declining cigarette sales, an inability to find a breakthrough next-gen product, and slowing growth in revenue and profits. As you can see from the chart below, British American Tobacco stock is down sharply over the last decade, and Philip Morris and Altria have only posted modest gains. Even on a total return basis, all three have underperformed the S&P 500."", ""Despite those headwinds, which have also included massive write-downs for things like Altria's minority stake in JUUL and British American Tobacco's U.S. cigarette portfolio, income investors still like the tobacco sector for its generous dividend yields."", ""At its current share price, British American Tobacco offers investors a dividend yield of 9.5%, making it one of the highest-yielding stocks on the market. However, a high yield alone doesn't make a stock a buy, as the chart above helps illustrate. So is British American Tobacco a dividend stock worth buying, or is it a yield trap?"", 'British American Tobacco stunned investors last month by taking a $31 billion impairment charge, which the company said was consistent with its vision to ""Build a Smokeless World"" and the nature of the headwinds in the U.S. cigarette industry. It said the write-off was primarily related to its acquired U.S. combustibles brands, which include Camel, Newport, and other brands that came to BAT in its $49 billion purchase of Reynolds American in 2017.', ""That update also reflects the reality that demand for cigarettes continues to decline. British American Tobacco hasn't delivered its full 2023 results yet, but the company said it expects to report 3% to 5% constant-currency revenue growth for the year, with tobacco sales volume falling\xa0 by 3%. It also guided for adjusted earnings-per-share growth in the mid-single-digit percentages on a constant-currency basis."", 'Like peers Altria and Philip Morris, BAT has struggled to find a winner in the next-gen heated products category, and the company lost market share last year. Revenue from new categories was up 29% in the first half of the year to 1.66 billion pounds. Cigarette volume, meanwhile, was down 4.7% on an organic basis in the first half, and constant-currency revenue in the category was up 0.2% to 10.8 billion pounds.', 'Looking ahead, the company is guiding for low-single-digit revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in 2024, and is targeting an improvement to 3% to 5% revenue growth and mid-single-digit percentage adjusted operating profit growth.', ""British American Tobacco's dividend is well funded, as the company had a dividend payout ratio of 76% based on cash flow and just 61% on an accounting basis. That should reassure investors that BAT can continue to fund its dividend even in a slow-growth environment."", ""However, in a best-case scenario based on the company's guidance, British American Tobacco's business is only expected to generate modest top- and bottom-line growth, and the risk for further challenges is clear, as there are still significant regulatory risks in new products and the potential for taxes and other restrictions to increase on cigarettes."", 'The stock is cheap and the dividend looks safe, but the upside potential of the stock is limited. Dividend investors looking solely for yield might want to consider BAT, but there are still a lot of risks in the tobacco sector that can lead to share price depreciation in the coming years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in British American Tobacco P.l.c. right now?', 'Before you buy stock in British American Tobacco P.l.c., consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and British American Tobacco P.l.c. wasn't one of them.

These quarterly updates often have market-moving powers, and that's especially true for Netflix's holiday-season results."", ""Investors with long memories might recall the stock's 22% jump on the day after the fourth-quarter report for fiscal year 2011, which made it clear that the recent Qwikster debacle actually was a good idea."", 'Six years later, Netflix investors enjoyed a 10% single-day jump as part of a 21% gain in four days, inspired by 8.3 million net new members in the early days of original content production.', ""Fast-forward to 2022 for a darker twist on the same needle-moving powers, as Netflix shares took a 29% swan dive in the week following the Q4 2021 report. The gung-ho subscriber growth was nowhere to be found and management's guidance for the next quarter was dismal."", ""It's not always rainbows and butterflies; It's often compromise that moves us along. This powerful financial report can be a double-edged sword."", ""With another holiday-quarter report on tap, it's time to address a common question. Will Netflix ever join the elite club of trillion-dollar market caps? Rome wasn't built in a day and Netflix stands a long way away from that ambitious target, so let's give the company the rest of this decade to make that steep climb. Even so, what would it take to lift Netflix's stock all the way to $1 trillion by the year 2030?"", 'As a longtime Netflix shareholder and regular table-pounder concerning the company\'s bright future, I would love to slap down a quick ""yes"" and move on to the next game-changing investor question. But that wouldn\'t be honest. I\'m talking about a colossal jump here, from $212 billion to $1 trillion. That\'s nearly a fivefold gain, clocking in at a total of 370%.', ""I'll add another year to Netflix's trillion-dollar deadline by moving the goalpost to the end of 2030 instead of the January fireworks. Now I'm looking at a seven-year timespan. The compound average growth rate (CAGR) of that climb works out to 24.8%."", ""That's a high-octane speed burst with a nitro boost -- lasting for seven years. I'm sorry, but that's not a realistic target."", 'I\'m not calling the trillion-dollar goal ""impossible."" Soaring gains like these are indeed possible, and some market-beating winners make it look easy sometimes.', 'For instance, semiconductor designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has posted a 65% CAGR over the last decade, thanks to a 228% gain (more than a triple) in the last year alone. The current artificial intelligence (AI) furor has been good to Nvidia investors, making the stock the fastest gainer on the stock market over the last year and the last decade.', '84 companies have achieved a CAGR of 24.8% or more in the last 10-year period, according to data from Macrotrends. As it turns out, Netflix is on that list with a 26.3% average growth rate. As I said, it can be done.', ""Then again, most of Netflix's 10-year gains materialized between 2014 and 2020. Video-streaming services were young and wild and exciting back then and Netflix had few serious challengers. It's a different ball of wax today with slower growth, price-sensitive consumers, and a plethora of rival services. The stock's CAGR in that market-stomping 5-year span works out to 48.3% while the most recent five-year increase stops at 7.2%. The slower subscriber growth in 2022 had brutal effects on this stock chart."", ""Tuesday's earnings report should clarify the company's progress with recently launched and upcoming business ideas, and the earnings call promises to be interesting. Whether this report sends Netflix's stock price to the basement or the moon, remember that it's just one step on a long journey. Management's commentary on the business plan is always more important than any of the financial metrics on tap."", 'What if I expect Netflix to execute its newfound profit-focused business plan with more steak than sizzle, giving the stock a market-beating CAGR of roughly 15% for the foreseeable future?', 'At that speed, Netflix investors would see a 166% return by the end of 2030. The market cap would stand at $564 million by then, assuming a constant share count. The recently approved $10 billion buyback program (and similar follow-on profit-sharing programs) could accelerate investor returns along the way, but would also shrink the market cap by the same amount, thus pushing my trillion-dollar goal further away.', ""The trillion-dollar mirage would materialize after approximately 11 years at this hypothetical growth rate. Will Netflix still be a media-streaming specialist in 2035? Well, nobody knows. The whole world may have moved on to some new entertainment technology you and I haven't even imagined yet. If so, Netflix could be an obsolete afterthought with a shrinking market cap -- or perhaps leading the charge into yet another brand-new market as it did with DVD mailers and digital streaming services."", 'Betting on Netflix is a vote of confidence in its ability to reinvent and adapt in an ever-changing digital landscape. I feel good about its chances to deliver robust shareholder returns over the next few years, but the future gets murkier in the next decade. Anyone who claims to have a clear view of the far future is probably trying to sell you something.', 'The company should reach that lofty trillion-dollar target someday, but probably not by 2030 and the trillionaire club will probably grow from a handful of members to dozens of names by then. If and when Netflix crosses this goal line, investors will be used to trillion-dollar market footprints -- just a normal Tuesday night on Wall Street at that point.', ""And that's alright. Wealth-building is a marathon, not a sprint, and Netflix looks prepared for a strong long-term run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

This is a big reason behind the popularity of “dividend aristocrat” stocks, or stocks with a more than 25 year track record of dividend growth.', 'Yet while some of the highest-quality dividend stocks out there have “dividend aristocrat,” or, in some cases, “dividend king” (50 years or more of consecutive dividend growth) status, names in either category aren’t the only long-term dividend names to consider.', 'There are also plenty of “aristocrats” in the making, stocks that have ten years or more of dividend growth under their belts. In some cases, these rising-star dividend stocks may be stronger opportunities, in terms of yield and price appreciation.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With this, let’s take a look at seven long-term dividend stocks, of either the “aristocrat” or “aspiring aristocrat” variety, and see why each one is worthy of making a buy-and-hold position at current prices.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is global leader in the payroll processing industry. With its deep economic moat, the company has a strong track record of steady growth and consistent earnings, resulting in strong total returns (price appreciation and dividends) for investors.', 'As I have argued previously, this makes ADP stock a top choice among stocks to buy and hold for years, decades, or even over several generations. While arguably trading at a fair valuation (25.9 times forward earnings), given the aforementioned qualities, and assuming high single-digit earnings growth continues, this valuation is likely sustainable.', 'At current prices, ADP sports a forward yield of 2.37%. This may not sound like “high yield” to you, but with the company just a year away from reaching “dividend king” status, and the latest dividend increase coming in at 12%, these payouts are likely to continue being a significant contributor to total returns.', 'Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com', 'American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a water utility company, serving 3.4 million customers across fourteen U.S. states. With fifteen years of consecutive dividend growth, this stock is a decade away from reaching “aristocrat” status.', 'Again though, “aspiring aristocrats” like AWK stock should also be considered top choices among long-term dividend stocks. Trading for 27.4 times forward earnings, it’s not as if shares have been under-the-radar of the market. Like with ADP, AWK’s is fairly valued rather than undervalued.', 'However, with AWK representing ownership in a high-margin, recession resistant business. With sell-side forecasts calling for high-single digit earnings growth in the coming years, this valuation is likely sustainable. Shares in turn could keep moving higher, in tandem with this earnings growth. AWK has a 2.14% annual dividend yield. Payouts have grown by an average of 9.31% per year over the past five years.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is another “aspiring aristocrat” I’ve included in past coverage of top stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. As it relates to long-term capital growth, there are two strong catalysts in motion. First, geopolitical tensions are rising and aren’t likely to simmer down anytime soon.', 'This bodes well for defense stocks across the board, and LHX stock is no exception. Second, there is great potential for cost/growth synergies, as a result of L3Harris’ penchant for making “bolt-on” acquisitions of other defense contracting companies.', 'Regarding dividend growth, LHX has increased payouts 22 years in a row, hence the “aspiring aristocrat” moniker for this 2.19%-yielding stock. While the company’s last dividend increase was small (1.79%), a re-acceleration of earnings growth due to the above-mentioned catalysts could mean a return to larger dividend increases seen in the recent past.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Shares in NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) struggled during most of 2023, but make no mistake. NEE remains one of the top long-term dividend stocks, and could produce strong total returns for investors buying it today.', 'NEE stock slumped because of rising interest rates and their impact on growth, but has started to bounce back due to growing expectations about interest rate cuts later this year. Trading for 18 times estimated 2024 earnings, shares appear more than reasonably priced, given mid-to-high single digit growth forecasts. A further renewal of appreciation for NEE’s long-term potential could mean a continued re-rating to the upside.', 'Speaking of earnings growth, don’t forget such growth also points to further increases in this “aristocrat’s” quarterly payouts. The stock today has a forward annual yield of 3.06%. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy has increased its dividend payout by an average of 11% annually.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', '“Dividend aristocrat” McDonalds (NYSE:MCD) may be considered the top restaurant stock among long-term dividend investors, but instead of opting for the golden arches, you may want to select Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) instead.', 'The ubiquitous coffee chain still has a ways to go before becoming an “aristocrat” itself.', 'However, between now and when SBUX stock attains this status, shares could produce very strong returns. Shares currently have an annual dividend yield of 2.48%. This payout has grown by double-digits on average each year over the past five years.', 'More importantly, atop this baseline return, is the likely continued price appreciation, driven by earnings growth. Forecasts call for Starbucks’ earnings to increase by 15.5% this fiscal year (ending September 2024), and by between 16% and 17% during the following two fiscal years after that. Not too shabby, for a stock trading for just 22.3 times forward earnings.', 'Source: RMC42/ShutterStock.com', 'When it comes to long-term dividend stocks, Snap-On (NYSE:SNA) is another name to consider. The industrial tool maker’s dividend (current forward yield of 2.62%) has increased by 14.5% on average annually over the past five years.', 'Admittedly, this level of dividend growth may not seem sustainable. After all, forecasts call for mixed results in the coming years. So then, why make SNA stock a “set and forget” long-term buy? While encountering a rough patch today, over a longer time frame Snap-On has demonstrated consistent profitability growth.', 'Furthermore, Snap-On beat expectations when it last reported earnings. Future results could come in much stronger than sell-side estimates suggest. Reasonably-priced at 15.2 times forward earnings, there may even be room for an expansion of SNA’s forward multiple. Growth re-acceleration, success with a recent acquisition, or even greater investor awareness may result in an eventual re-rating for Snap-On shares.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'With a forward dividend yield of 0.79%, Visa (NYSE:V) at first may not seem like a noteworthy dividend stock. Yet while the company, one of the world’s leading payment technology firms, sports a low yield, said yield has been growing at a rapid clip.', 'That is, payouts for V stock have grown by around 16.3% on average annually over the past five years. Such payout growth may be poised to continue. As I argued previously, numerous factors point to the company continuing to report double-digit earnings growth in the years to come.', 'The largest factor is the global pivot away from using cash to using cards/digital payment options for consumer transactions. This long-term trend is of course also a good sign when it comes to further price appreciation. This should outweigh any near-term concerns about the stock’s valuation (26.7 times forward earnings) and low yield.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Bank of New York Mellon's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power.

Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 7.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively."", 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count.

Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our information suggests that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$52m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. ', 'The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Bank of New York Mellon. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.', 'While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

However, no healthcare company has reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Perhaps that's not so surprising. After all, very few companies are part of this elite club."", ""But it's only a matter of time until one healthcare stock finally hits that goal, so which one will do it first? My money is on Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). Let's find out why."", ""Let's start with a list of some healthcare companies that have a chance at joining the trillion-dollar club within, say, a decade. These are the largest ones in the world. Eli Lilly sits on top, with a market cap of about $610 billion. Next comes insurance specialist UnitedHealth Group, valued at roughly $482 billion -- or over $100 billion less than Eli Lilly. Rounding up the top three is another leading drugmaker based in Denmark, Novo Nordisk, with a market cap of $470 billion. Johnson & Johnson ranks fourth with a business worth $390 billion, while Merck completes the top five at $300 billion."", ""Of course, there is always the possibility a much smaller healthcare company will overtake all of these and land at a valuation of $1 trillion first. Still, given that Eli Lilly is currently the largest, all it has to do is perform at least as well as all the ones within striking distance while hoping none outside this small group somehow skyrocket to the top. Let's put that second possibility aside for now."", ""Can any of Eli Lilly's direct competitors perform much better than it will before it reaches $1 trillion? Starting with Merck, the company's main growth driver for a long time has been its cancer drug Keytruda. While it will continue performing well for a bit longer, Keytruda is set to face a patent cliff by 2028. Merck is working to resolve this problem, but until the company's post-Keytruda plans are much clearer, the market is unlikely to reward the stock by bidding it up significantly."", ""Johnson & Johnson is another great company, especially for dividend investors. However, the drugmaker's legal problems should continue weighing on the stock. That doesn't mean it isn't worth holding shares of Johnson & Johnson, but the upside is somewhat limited compared to what it would have to do to overtake Eli Lilly. That leaves three stocks in the running."", ""Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have a lot in common. They operate in the same industry and are the two leaders in the markets for diabetes and obesity drugs. However, the former has an edge over its longtime foe. Eli Lilly's newest medicine for diabetes/obesity, Mounjaro (marketed as Zepbound in helping to manage weight), seems to be more effective than Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and is projected to become perhaps the best-selling therapy in the history of the industry."", ""Furthermore, Eli Lilly has a much more diversified source of revenue. Novo Nordisk relies almost entirely on its diabetes and obesity work, which is not the case for its competitor. Eli Lilly still has several important therapies in other areas in the pipeline. It is currently awaiting approval for the Alzheimer's disease treatment donanemab, which is almost destined to become a blockbuster."", ""In short, it will be difficult for Novo Nordisk to outperform Eli Lilly in terms of financial results and stock market performances from here on out. That leaves just one company in the running: UnitedHealth Group. It is harder to compare these two behemoths that operate entirely different businesses. UnitedHealth is an excellent stock in its own right. However, once again, Eli Lilly starts with an edge of more than $100 billion in market value, which isn't easy to overcome."", ""Furthermore, while analysts see UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share (EPS) growing at an average of 11.6% for the next five years, Eli Lilly's estimated EPS growth in the next half a decade is more than twice that at 28.7%. At its current valuation, Eli Lilly needs to register a compound annual growth rate of 10.4% to become a trillion-dollar company in five years. In my view, that's well within the company's powers. And once it accomplishes that goal, the drugmaker won't stop."", 'The bottom line: Eli Lilly is an excellent stock to buy and hold today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the statistics related to the Muslim American community, you can go directly to the 5 States with the Highest Muslim Population in the US.', 'Islam ranks as the third-largest religion in the United States, following Christianity and Judaism. According to the latest studies, there are about 4.45 million Muslims in the country, accounting for approximately 1% of the total population. Muslim population in the US has been on the rise for more than a decade due to high fertility rates and migration of Muslims into the country. Consequently, the number of mosques has more than doubled during the last two decades. The Muslim population in the US increased significantly during the twentieth century. About 1.7 million Muslims became legal permanent residents of the US within a span of just over two decades from 1991 to 2012. About 72% of American Muslims are immigrants or a part of the ""second generation."" They are also America’s youngest religious community, with approximately a quarter aged between 18 and 24 years. Muslim Americans make up one of the most racially diverse religious communities in the country, with 25% blacks, 24% whites, 18% Asians, 18% Arabs, 7% mixed races, and 5% Hispanics. However, the majority of Muslims are immigrants, with 58% being born outside the USA. The Muslim population is also substantially dispersed in the country, with Virginia and Arizona being amongst the states with the highest Muslim population in the US. A study by the Pew Research Center forecasts that the number of Muslims in the US will reach 8.1 million or 2.1% of the total population by 2050, making Islam the second largest religion in the country. You can also check out the 25 Countries where Muslim Population will Increase the Most by 2050 here.', 'Despite being a minority, Muslims in the United States are finding success within society and are more optimistic, as per a survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU). Muslims in America have made a significant contribution to small businesses, which are crucial for the US economy. About 8% of Muslims have their own business and employ 8 other people, on average, which amounts to about 1.37 billion jobs. The number of Muslim-owned businesses has reached 96,000 in New York City and 36,000 in Michigan. Various databases show that American Muslim-owned businesses are primarily concentrated in New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Florida, and Michigan, with fewer such businesses in Alabama, Texas, or Tennessee. These Muslim entrepreneurs serve both the domestic and global “halal” economy with their products. The global halal market is huge, with Muslims spending $2 trillion on halal products in 2019 alone. \xa0These products include halal food, modest fashion, media, and recreation, as well as halal pharmaceuticals, Muslim-friendly tourism, halal cosmetics, and Islamic finance. Notable businesses owned by Muslim Americans include Muzz (a Muslim matchmaking app), Launchgood (a crowdfunding platform for Muslim Entrepreneurship), and Splashgear (an apparel company providing modest watersports gear for Muslim women).', 'The rising Muslim population has also led to an increase in demand for Shariah-compliant stocks. These stocks are from businesses that conduct their activities in accordance with Shariah rules and refrain from gaining exposure to sectors like alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. As per the Islamic Finance Development Report 2021 by Refinitiv, the cumulative value of Islamic financial assets stood at $3.37 trillion by the end of 2020. This marked an increase from $2.96 trillion in the preceding year and from $2.2 trillion in 2015. Furthermore, the year 2021 observed a record launch of over 900 Islamic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) globally and attracted more than $1 trillion in net inflows. Some of the popular halal dividend stocks to buy include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT).', 'Here’s what Appleseed Fund said about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings:\xa0Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10.', 'The term Dividend Challengers refers to publicly traded companies in the US that have consistently increased their dividend payments to shareholders for a period spanning five to less than 10 consecutive years. This category includes companies that have demonstrated a commitment to distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends over a moderate timeframe. Investors find dividend growers particularly attractive for several reasons. Historical data indicates that stocks belonging to this category have outperformed the broader market, delivering stronger returns. Moreover, these stocks tend to showcase lower levels of volatility compared to the overall market', 'T. Rowe Price conducted an analysis revealing that stocks exhibiting dividend growth within the large-cap Russell 1000 Index consistently outperformed the benchmark. This outperformance was observed both during market downturns and in more bullish periods over the 35 years concluding on December 31, 2020. The report also highlighted that, in contrast to securities relying heavily on an above-average yield for their total return, companies with the capacity to increase their cash flows and dividends consistently throughout economic cycles may counteract some of the erosive effects caused by inflation and higher interest rates. This suggests that businesses with the potential for sustained growth in cash flows and dividends may be more resilient in mitigating the impact of economic challenges, contributing to the preservation of the value of future cash flows.', 'In terms of absolute returns, dividends have historically constituted a significant portion of overall equity returns. Looking back to 1926, more than 40% of the total return of the U.S. stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, has been attributed to dividends. However, dividends offer more than just their cash value. According to findings from a report by Cohen and Steers, companies that pay dividends have shown a considerable outperformance compared to non-payers, and they have achieved this with lower volatility. The report noted that in the last decade leading up to 2010, dividend-paying stocks outpaced non-payers by an annual margin of 620 basis points, while their risk, measured by standard deviation, was notably lower. This advantage of dividend payers over non-payers extends further over a 30-year time frame.', 'For investors seeking dividend growth stocks, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

One of the first stocks to report every quarter is Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), one of the largest airlines in the world. Generating tens of billions in revenue across the globe, Delta Air's financial health gives investors a great read on the travel industry and the general health of consumer spending."", 'This quarter, investors are looking pessimistically at Delta Air stock. Despite the company growing revenue and earnings in 2023, shares fell close to 10% the day after its earnings release, likely due to disappointing 2024 guidance for free cash flow. Delta stock now trades at a dirt cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 6, which is well below the S&P 500 average. Does that mean the stock is ready to take flight in 2024?', '2023 was the year Delta Air fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue was $58 billion for the year, well above its pre-pandemic levels and up 14.6% compared to 2022.', ""Profit margins look strong, too. Even though Delta and other airlines are facing cost pressures from its employee unions and a pilot shortage, its operating margin was 9.5% in 2023, which equates to $5.5 billion in operating earnings. While this is good news, Delta's operating margin has been much higher in the past. For example, in 2016 it posted an operating margin of 17.5%. If Delta had a 17.5% operating margin in 2023, its operating income would have been over $10 billion."", ""So what has investors pessimistic? Well, there is general pessimism about airlines due to a potential for a recession in the United States, with the pandemic mayhem in the back of everyone's minds. But there is also the concern with aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which had another incident with its 737 Max aircraft as a door plug blew out in flight on an Alaska Airlines\xa0flight. This is another bullet point on a long list of worries for Boeing's products, which could restrict supply growth for airlines."", 'Luckily for Delta, it has minimal exposure to Boeing compared to other U.S. carriers -- Airbus is its main manufacturing partner. While it is still waiting on a huge backlog to get more aircraft supply flying around the world, Airbus has had much better success than Boeing over the last decade, which should be good for its largest customer, Delta.', ""On top of selling airline tickets, Delta Air is one of the largest credit card issuers in the world. These cards -- along with its loyalty program -- keep customers locked in with Delta and produce high-margin payments revenue. Its partner is American Express, which runs the payments infrastructure and lending for Delta's credit cards."", 'In 2023, Delta received $6.8 billion in revenue-sharing payments from American Express, or 11.7% of its overall revenue. Next year, it is guiding for credit card revenue to grow 10% year over year and make up an even larger portion of the business. This should remain a growth driver for Delta over the long term and can help it expand margins if the segment becomes a larger part of the consolidated business.', ""Based on its forward guidance, Delta Air's stock is quite cheap. It trades at a forward P/E below 6 while the S&P 500 trades at an earnings ratio above 20. Delta's business is not going away anytime soon, either. Its brand is now almost 100 years old."", ""But investors should know the company does have a lot of debt on its balance sheet. This brings its enterprise value up to around $37 billion compared to its market cap of $24 billion. On top of this, airlines are capital-intensive and generally struggle to convert earnings to free cash flow. I think a better earnings ratio for Delta is enterprise value-to-free cash flow (EV/FCF) instead of the traditional P/E. Using its forward free-cash-flow guidance of $3 billion to $4 billion, Delta's EV/FCF between 9.25 and 12.3."", 'This is still cheap, but not as cheap as a forward P/E of 6. Despite this, shares still look undervalued at these prices. If you are bullish on the airline industry, Delta could be a solid buy after its Q4 earnings drop.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Delta Air Lines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Delta Air Lines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Delta Air Lines wasn't one of them.

On the other hand, its stock is down slightly more than 23% in 2024. Is it time to load up on shares or avoid it altogether?', 'This won\'t be a suspenseful movie, as I will cut to the chase in the opening credits. The answer is ""no,"" and that view concerns the risk around the company\'s medium-term outlook. I think recent events have created a material risk around the outlook management gave at the November 2022 investor conference, and the company might be forced to, at the least, walk back the higher end of expectations.', ""Management's financial objectives matter because investors inevitably price them into their expectations, and doing so with Boeing makes the stock look attractive. As a reminder, here are the critical components of the objectives previously laid out for 2025 to 2026:"", 'Free cash flow (FCF) of $10 billion', 'Included in this forecast is the assumption for operating cash flow of $9 billion from Boeing commercial airplanes (BCA), $3 billion from Boeing Global Services (BGS), and $2 billion from Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS)', 'Key assumptions include a 737 production rate of 50 a month by 2025/2026, a 787 production rate of 10 a month, and a 777/777X production rate of four a month.', 'Note that the 2025 to 2026 time frame gives Boeing some leeway. For example, hitting the FCF objective at the end of 2025 is much easier than hitting it at the start of 2025. For reference, Wall Street analysts currently have $9.3 billion in FCF penciled in for 2025.', ""For a sense of what these figures mean for valuations, Boeing's current market cap is $121 billion, so $9.3 billion in 2025 would put it at 13 times FCF in 2025, and hitting (in a worst-case scenario) $10 billion in 2026 would put it at 12.1 times FCF. These are excellent valuations for a company that will be producing 50 737 airplanes a month if the objective is being met."", ""However, there's a problem. Or instead, a series of problems. Going into 2023, investors were hoping for a year of quiet execution from BCA, with the business hitting its target on the 737 of 400 to 450 deliveries. In addition, investors hoped BDS would avoid more costly charges and cost overruns as it works through problematic fixed-price development programs."", 'Unfortunately, none of these things happened in 2023, and the reasons why also threaten its medium-term objectives.', ""Starting with BDS, Boeing is not alone in having issues and margin pressures in its defense business. Ongoing supply chain issues and soaring raw material and labor costs/availability have challenged defense companies' ability to deliver on margin. It's even more problematic for fixed-price programs signed in less inflationary times."", 'The third-quarter BDS earnings are illustrative: a $482 million charge on VC-25B (Air Force One), a $315 million loss tied to a legacy satellite contract, and a $136 million less than expected reduction in costs on the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone.', 'As a result, BDS\' operating margin was negative 16.9% in the quarter. CFO Brian West walked back expectations for BDS\' contribution to the 2025/2026 objectives on the earnings call, saying, ""We have a lot of confidence that they will be contributing to that $10 billion, maybe not quite as much, but they\'re going to be positive.""', 'The issues at BCA are much higher-profile. While Boeing did hit its target for 787 deliveries in 2023 (73 vs. a target of 70 to 80), it missed its 737 delivery target of 400 to 450 by only delivering 396.', ""Beset with manufacturing quality issues on fuselages supplied by Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing's delivery rate fell short of expectations. While Boeing has taken action to remove uncertainty around the issue, the recent blowout on a fuselage on an Alaska Airlines flight has set the company back again, and further inspections, not least from Spirit AeroSystems, the Federal Aviation Administration, and Chinese airlines (which may delay 737 deliveries) threaten its delivery outlook."", ""The company is set to deliver its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 31. Management has already told investors to expect an FCF toward the low end of the $3 billion to $5 billion forecast for 2023. In addition, the BDS issues are ongoing, and management has already walked back medium-term expectations. Throw in the latest challenge to 737 delivery rates, and it wouldn't be surprising to see Boeing, at least, push out its $10 billion expectations to the late end of the 2025/2026 period, if not to lower it overall. It's something to consider before buying into the stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

The S&P 500 rallied in reaction to the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would cut benchmark interest rates in 2024, but the index fell last week after the Fed qualified that by saying it might not make those cuts as rapidly as investors expect."", 'The mood on Wall Street is uncertain, and that makes this a good time to shore up your portfolio with some secure dividend stocks that are less susceptible to mood swings in the market. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) are two incredible dividend stocks to buy now and hold for the long term.', 'One thing that well-respected investors like Warren Buffett frequently point out is that companies that own brands customers like are typically good investments. A business is only as good as the products it produces, and a company that can churn out popular products year after year is likely to be around for a long time and create solid returns for its shareholders.', 'Nike is the largest apparel and footwear company in the U.S. overall, and the largest athletic wear company in the world. It has the highest brand value of literally any apparel and footwear brand in the world, according to Statista.', ""It's a blue chip winner with a lead so large it's virtually unchallengeable, at least in the near term. It's also reliably profitable. It continues to resonate with its global fans, taking the top place in the Piper Sandler Taking Stock With Teens survey yet again for most popular apparel brand and most popular footwear brand. Although Nike is popular among all age groups, its young customers will drive its continuing growth."", 'Nike felt the pressure of inflation, and sales growth has been slow. Its margins have also been impacted by rising costs and markdowns. But Nike is well-positioned to bounce back. It has relationships with a slew of top celebrity athlete endorsers who continue to dominate in sports and amplify the Nike brand.', 'Nike Direct sales increased 6% year over year in its fiscal 2024 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), illustrating the power of its loyalty-building efforts. Several of its capsule collections increased sales by double-digit percentages in the quarter, and its strong pipeline of innovation will be key to future growth.', ""Nike pays a dividend that yields 1.47% at the current share price, which is close to the S&P 500's average yield.

It opened seven new stores in its fiscal 2023 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), and despite its size, management still sees opportunities for expansion."", 'However, home improvement and most home-related industries have been highly impacted by the interest rate environment, and Home Depot is feeling the pain. Sales and comparable sales both declined 3% year over year, and earnings per share dipped to $3.81 from $4.24 in the prior-year period.', 'Home Depot is always working to provide an upgraded, interconnected experience for customers, and that has led to long-term loyalty and sales generation. Two things that management pointed out in the third-quarter report were that almost half of its digital orders were fulfilled by stores, which results in faster and cheaper delivery, and that digital orders increased by 5% year over year despite the overall decline in sales. Home Depot completely overhauled its omnichannel systems before the pandemic, and at the time, it took a hit on profits.', ""Investors had soured on the stock, but Home Depot was well-positioned to benefit when the pandemic hit, and those investments helped it capture market share and generate soaring sales.

The disappointment has been more pronounced in just the last 12 months, a time when Nike's stock fell 21%, compared to the broader market's 19% gain."", ""Investors are souring on the leading apparel and footwear business. And there are good reasons for this pessimism. If you're thinking about adding Nike to your portfolio, it's best to think again."", 'Consider Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU), an unstoppable stock, instead.', ""Nike's recent sales trends are concerning, and this could be a key reason why the stock is underperforming so much. In each of the last four fiscal quarters, revenue growth has decelerated on a year-over-year basis. In the most recent fiscal quarter (Q2 2024 ended Nov. 30), sales were up by just 1%."", ""And for the full fiscal year of 2024, management now expects revenue to rise by 1%, down from prior guidance of mid-single-digit growth. They continue to blame weak macroeconomic conditions that have impacted consumer spending, particularly in the most recent holiday shopping period, as well as a strong U.S. dollar that creates a headwind when recording revenue that's earned in international markets."", 'To its credit, Nike has better control over its inventory. And the leadership team is embarking on a major cost-cutting plan to reduce expenses by over $2 billion over the next three years. The positive effects might already be present, as the business saw its net income increase 19% last quarter.', ""Nonetheless, it's easy to see why investors would be discouraged right now. Nike is hoping to stabilize its operations in the near term."", 'In the past four years, a bunch of headwinds have derailed many companies. The list includes the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and the possibility of an upcoming recession. Yet Lululemon continues to hum along.', 'Lululemon has registered 13 straight quarters of more than 18% year-over-year sales growth, a truly impressive feat. These double-digit gains are certainly better than what Nike has been able to produce.', ""Even better, Lululemon is incredibly profitable. Because its products carry a more premium status than Nike's, Lululemon's gross margin of 57% last fiscal quarter is higher than its biggest competitor's. And this has been the case if we look back several years."", 'Moreover, Lululemon has a much larger growth runway in front of it. After the business achieved its financial goals announced in 2019 ahead of schedule, management introduced another outlook, known as the ""Power of Three x2,"" where the primary objective is to double sales between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2026. Key to this strategy is to bolster men\'s, international, and digital revenues.', ""Based on the executive team's track record of previously exceeding its long-term expectations, I'm confident the company can do the same this time around. And this could lead to strong returns for investors."", ""Despite the positive characteristics about Lululemon's business, especially when compared to Nike, there is one factor that might give investors pause: the valuation."", ""Shares have been a massive outperformer historically. And as of this writing, they trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37.6. This is about 33% more expensive than Nike's forward P/E of 28.2."", ""However, based on what I've discussed, it's easy to find arguments supporting why Lululemon should trade at a premium valuation when compared to its bigger rival. Over the next five to 10 years, there's a high chance that Lululemon's revenue and earnings will continue to grow at a much faster clip than Nike, thus justifying the stock's valuation."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lululemon Athletica wasn't one of them.

That's because these companies deal with a type of design suite specifically for semiconductors that are so vital to AI's development. As a result, industry leaders Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) and Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS) have been off to the races, sporting respective gains of 59% and 71% since the start of 2023."", ""Synopsys stock has fallen as of late, though, on rumors it would try to acquire Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS), which produces software that analyzes and simulates engineered parts and systems before they're manufactured. Synopsys confirmed the rumor in late December and is offering to acquire Ansys for $35 billion. If successful, this will be one of the largest-ever tech mergers and acquisitions in a big bet on the future of AI. But investors should be aware of some important details before even considering buying right now."", 'On the surface, a tie-up between Synopsys and Ansys may look confusing. After all, Synopsys is a high-tech software business catering primarily to semiconductor companies and other businesses that design and assemble computing systems with chips. Ansys, by comparison, only counts about one-third of its revenue from semiconductor and computing customers. Its simulation software is primarily used for mechanical processes, not electrical ones.', ""But that isn't to say Ansys can't handle complex electrical design processes. In fact, as the companies said in the press release explaining the deal, all Ansys customers can benefit from having access to chip design software. That's because semiconductors are designed into products of all kinds these days, from cars to toothbrushes, and the trend isn't going to let up. On the contrary, with AI increasing the usefulness of embedded computing, many product companies are interested in putting AI to use but have limited AI and advanced software know-how."", ""That's the rationale for Synopsys-plus-Ansys. Together, the companies say their software suites have a total addressable market of $28 billion that's expected to grow at an average of 11% a year through 2028."", 'All this sounds exciting, but Synopsys shareholders should give pause here. Intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, and the deal likely not going through until well into 2025, are but minor concerns.', 'After news of the acquisition broke, Ansys stock spiked. The company is now valued at about a $29 billion market cap (lower than the mid-December valuation, in part due to uncertainty around merger approval). But even now, that values Ansys at a hefty 60 times trailing-12-month earnings and 46 times free cash flow.', 'To pay the premium price tag to Ansys shareholders, Synopsys has secured $16 billion in debt financing. That will blow up what was a squeaky-clean balance sheet that had $1.59 billion in cash and short-term investments and just $18 million in debt as of the last quarterly update.', ""Paying down this debt will be a top priority for Synopsys should it be successful in taking over Ansys. The company's long-standing stock repurchase program to return excess cash to shareholders is now suspended until then."", ""For the time being, the pending purchase of Ansys could keep a lid on Synopsys stock, which itself also trades for a high premium (64 times trailing-12-month earnings and 52 times free cash flow). The promise of AI development over the next decade is exciting and will likely spawn more merger and acquisition deals like this one. But investors should pause before buying the hype. Synopsys' bid for Ansys is all about the long term, putting healthy shareholder returns at risk over the next few years."", ""As an alternative, also keep an eye on Synopsys' chip design peer Cadence Design Systems. It, too, trades for a premium price, so consider using a dollar-cost averaging plan if you decide to buy at all."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Synopsys right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Synopsys, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Synopsys wasn't one of them.

Here are three ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are simply too cheap to ignore.', 'Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC) based on market cap. It provides financing to middle-market businesses with a focus on the upper tier of the market.', ""The company's dividend yield is nearly 9.5%. This sky-high yield is largely due to BDCs being required to return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends to be exempt from paying federal taxes."", ""Ares Capital's shares trade at only 8.8 times forward earnings. Its price-to-book ratio is a low 1.07. These metrics would make any stock's valuation look attractive."", ""But Ares Capital isn't cheap because it's performing poorly. The company's business is booming with core earnings per share jumping 18% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. It has also delivered total returns that topped the S&P 500 by more than 85% since its initial public offering in 2004. Ares Capital's total return has also beaten the S&P 500 in the last three-year and five-year periods as well."", 'Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) ranks as one of the largest drugmakers in the world. The company has been in business since 1849. It currently markets eight products with annual sales of $1 billion or more.', ""Big pharma stocks have long been favorites for income investors because of their strong dividends. Pfizer is no exception. That's especially the case now with its dividend yield at nearly 6%."", ""Pfizer's forward earnings multiple is 12.5, well below the healthcare sector average of nearly 18.4. This low valuation is the result of declining sales for the company's COVID-19 products and the upcoming loss of exclusivity for several top-selling drugs."", ""However, Pfizer's long-term prospects look good. The drugmaker expects to add roughly $20 billion in annual revenue by 2030 from new product launches and new indications for existing products. Business development deals could generate another $25 billion in additional annual revenue."", ""You're probably familiar with Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) even if you're not one of the company's customers. Verizon provides wireless services in the U.S. and other countries. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world."", ""Verizon's dividend yield of over 6.8% should catch investors' attention. In addition to this ultra-high yield, the company has also increased its dividend for 17 consecutive years. That's the longest streak of dividend hikes in the U.S. telecommunications industry."", 'What about valuation? Verizon looks pretty good on that front, too. Its shares currently trade at close to 8.4 times expected earnings. By comparison, the average forward earnings multiple of S&P 500 stocks in the communications services sector is 17.3.', 'To be sure, Verizon faces some challenges. The wireless market is highly competitive. However, the company appears to be headed in the right direction. Verizon reported a significant improvement in free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023.

The types of stocks you gravitate toward will broadly be informed by your personal risk tolerance levels and interests. Healthcare is one particularly resilient industry to consider as you build out your basket of stocks this year."", ""Given the wealth of life-saving medicines, medical devices, and other products that healthcare companies produce in mass for a global consumer base, this industry tends to be far more resistant to periods of economic volatility than other spaces. If you're looking to put cash into promising healthcare stocks this month, here are two solid names to consider when you do."", ""Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has gone through a series of monumental changes over the last several years. Now that the feverish need for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies has dwindled compared to even a few years ago, Pfizer is entering another growth phase that has left some investors nonplussed. Shares traded down roughly 40% over the trailing 12 months. From becoming the world's largest producer of penicillin during World War II to its current status as one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with revenue streams that span disease areas from oncology to immunology, this is a company that has evolved many times through the years."", ""And while Pfizer may not be able to habitually clock $100 billion revenue years moving forward as it did in 2022, there are plenty of green flags for this mature business moving forward that investors shouldn't overlook. Pfizer has used the capital gleaned from its considerable sales of COVID-19 products to fuel a running streak of acquisitions. Some acquisitions of note over the last few years include Seagen, a biotech company that makes cancer drugs, Arena Pharmaceuticals, a company that makes therapies for immuno-inflammatory diseases, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, which is known for its migraine therapies like Nurtec, and Global Blood Therapeutics, which focuses on treatments for sickle cell disease."", ""Both thanks to a lightning streak of acquisitions and its own internal R&D efforts, Pfizer is in an 18-month period in which it plans to launch 19 new product approvals or expansions. The end goal is anywhere from $70 billion to $84 billion in annual revenue that doesn't include COVID-19 products by the year 2030. These 19 launches alone are set to bring in $20 billion in revenue by 2030. That goal would help Pfizer balance the loss of COVID-19 revenue and the $17 billion revenue hit from the loss of patent exclusivity on several core products that are expected in the coming years. Pfizer is also working on a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting campaign, a part of which will derive from workforce restructuring efforts and facility closures."", ""While revenue was down sharply year over year in Q3, Pfizer still brought in revenue of $13 billion, and its non-COVID-19 revenue rose 10% from the year-ago period. The fruits of its product launches will take time to have an effect, but the company has plenty of mainstay products driving growth, like its cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, whose key patents don't expire for several years and which brought in combined revenues of $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023."", ""Pfizer launched seven new products in 2023, which is more approvals than any other pharma company garnered last year. On a final note, this is a business that has been paying a quarterly dividend for 85 years and counting. Given the stock's volatility in recent months, the current yield is around 6%, making now a great time to buy in if you are convinced that the stock is worth it. Patient investors might find a lot to like about this stock in the coming years because the growth story looks far from over."", 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) is not as well-known a name as Pfizer and this biopharmaceutical company is in a much earlier stage of its growth story. While Pfizer has close to two centuries in business under its belt, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has around 20.', 'The company is known for several core products that span both oncology and neurological disease concerns. One of the most notable is its cannabidiol (CBD) drug Epidiolex (marketed as Epidyolex outside of North America), which treats seizures associated with multiple forms of epilepsy. Other key products of note include narcolepsy drugs Xyrem and its lower-sodium formulation, Xywav.', ""Of Jazz Pharmaceuticals' $972 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2023, roughly 60% of that total was attributable to sales of Xywav, Xyrem, and Epidiolex/Epidyolex. Jazz Pharmaceuticals also boasts key revenue drivers like Rylaze (marketed as Enrylaze outside North America), which is for patients with lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and Zepzelca, which treats patients with small cell lung cancer. On the whole, Jazz Pharmaceuticals pulled in close to $3 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2023 alone."", 'Oncology continues to be a key area of focus for this business. The company is getting ready to submit its biologics license application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, seeking accelerated approval for a candidate called zanidatamab as a second-line therapy for biliary tract cancer. Jazz Pharmaceuticals plans to seek multiple additional indications for the candidate in the future, which is being studied as a treatment for multiple HER2-expressing cancers including gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, metastatic breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. HER2 is a protein that influences cell growth. Excess HER2 levels can lead to the development of malignant tumors.', ""Jazz Pharmaceuticals hasn't been particularly well-loved by investors of late, but analysts on Wall Street think the stock could hit a median 12-month price target that represents about 55% upside from its current price. Even the low forecast gives the stock a 13% 12-month upside, which is slightly above the broader return of the stock market in an average year. Regardless of how the stock fluctuates in the coming months, the business boasts a compelling lineup of products, and its pipeline looks very promising.

For the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 43%. However, many stocks experienced triple-digit increases, leaving some investors questioning whether they could still find affordable stocks.', ""Fortunately, many value stocks stayed inexpensive despite the industry's strong performance, and those looking for a bargain may want to consider these five tech stocks in particular."", ""Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) performed well in 2023, but a new technology led some investors to question the company's future role in tech. OpenAI's ChatGPT introduced a generative AI tool that reinvigorated artificial intelligence, and its alliance with Microsoft made many investors wonder whether users would abandon Google in favor of Bing."", 'Nonetheless, Alphabet has introduced a competing generative AI tool called Gemini, a sign the company has no plans to surrender competitively. Moreover, Alphabet\'s $120 billion in liquidity gives it the resources needed to remain competitive in AI. Additionally, at a P/E ratio of 27, it is the cheapest of the so-called ""magnificent seven"" stocks, making it a more compelling buy as it works to win over AI investors again.', 'Like IBM, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) suffered for years after falling behind competitively. However, CEO Pat Gelsinger aimed to reclaim its technical lead and become a leading chip producer.', ""To this end, its Emerald Rapids and Meteor Lake processors have come a long way in closing Intel's competitive gap with AMD. Also, Intel Foundry Services has attracted many of tech's top businesses as clients."", 'Admittedly, Intel posted negative free cash flow for the year as it invested tens of billions in improvements. But free cash flow turned positive in the third quarter, and with the stock selling at just 16 times earnings, investors could find themselves wishing they had bought shares as it reclaims some of its competitive advantages.', 'IBM (NYSE: IBM) had become an afterthought in tech as its businesses became stagnant. However, buying Red Hat in 2019 and redefining itself as a cloud and supercomputing company has breathed new life into the venerable tech giant. Furthermore, it spun off its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl, showing a willingness to part with underperforming assets.', 'Despite struggles, IBM maintains a growing payout with a 4% dividend yield, and its $5.1 billion free cash flow in the first nine months of 2023 covered $4.5 billion in dividend costs. With a P/E ratio of just 22 and a return to a growth trajectory, IBM is well positioned to deliver market-beating returns.', ""PagSeguro Digital (NYSE: PAGS) is not a familiar name to American investors. Nonetheless, the Brazil-based fintech company has stood out for offering a unique financial product. Its platform serves as a digital wallet comparable to PayPal's Venmo that can also act as a checking account for Brazilian consumers and businesses. Additionally, it provides point-of-sale services and prepaid cards."", 'For the first nine months of 2023, free cash flow came in at 368 million reais ($75 million), up from a negative 169 million reais in the same year-ago period. With the international stock showing signs of recovery and a P/E ratio of 13, investors have both a bargain price and the catalyst needed to drive significant returns.', ""Competition, legacy costs, and capital expenditures have hampered Verizon's (NYSE: VZ) stock for years. While it is one of three nationwide 5G providers, keeping up with technological change while maintaining its network quality rating has come at a high cost."", ""However, the rise of AI and IoT makes Verizon's network a more vital part of the U.S. communications infrastructure. Moreover, investors receive a 6.8% dividend yield, and since free cash flow for the first nine months of 2023 rose 18% to $15 billion, the telecom stock covered the $8 billion in dividend costs.

In 2022, stable, dividend-paying companies were a beacon of safety amid a widespread downturn in the major indexes. Last year, mega-cap growth stocks, especially big tech, led to market exuberance and an outperforming year for the Nasdaq Composite.', ""It's too early to tell what 2024 will bring. But Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Target (NYSE: TGT) all lost value last year despite the S&P 500's gain of 24%. However, all three companies are Dividend Kings, having paid and raised their dividends for over 50 consecutive years."", ""Investors looking for safe, out-of-favor stocks have come to the right place. Here's why each stock is worth buying no matter what happens in the broader market."", ""On Jan. 11, Coca-Cola announced that it will be reporting fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings on Feb. 13. There's no word yet on a dividend increase. But history shows that Coke tends to raise its dividend in February. Investors should expect the quarterly dividend to rise to at least $0.48 per share, which would mark the company's 62nd year of consecutive dividend increases."", 'The dividend is a big reason to own Coke stock. Even without assuming a dividend raise, Coke yields 3.1%, which is higher than the average stock in the S&P 500. Using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust as a benchmark, the S&P 500 yields just 1.4%.', ""Coke has a resilient business model that can perform well regardless of the market cycle. But this advantage can also be a disadvantage, as Coke doesn't have a lot of upside even if the economy is thriving."", 'To achieve steady growth over time, Coke has to grow case volumes (sales), justify price increases, and operate a portfolio of successful brands while also adding brands to the mix to retain market share and diversify into new beverage categories. Overall, Coke has executed this strategy very well.', ""In the chart, you can see that Coke's revenue is just now returning to levels seen a decade ago. The difference today is that Coke has far higher operating margins, so it's making much more operating income per dollar of sales."", 'Part of Coke\'s future success will depend on an effective marketing campaign. The company\'s ""Raising the Bar: Marketing & Innovation"" presentation in third-quarter 2023 gave investors details of what to expect from Coke in the years to come. Coke recognizes that people have changing preferences. To maintain its market share, it has to grow its non-soda portfolio while not overspending on marketing and advertising at the expense of margins.', ""Overall, Coke seems to have a good handle on what it needs to do to keep delivering shareholder returns over time. The brand is strong, the portfolio is diverse, the dividend is solid, and the valuation isn't terrible, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.5."", 'Overall, Coke is a reliable passive income source and a worthy addition to any portfolio.', ""Procter & Gamble is very similar to Coke because it is a Dividend King that can perform well in a weak economy. And although Coke is considered a consumer staple company, soda, tea, coffee, and energy drinks aren't necessities in the same way as household essentials like toothpaste, detergent, toilet paper, and diapers are."", 'I like Coke, but I love P&G. The simple reason is that P&G is truly diversified. Whereas Coke covers different parts of the beverage category, P&G sells many different household staples, including beauty and grooming, healthcare, baby, feminine, and family care products, and fabric and home care.', ""For example, in a category like toilet paper, P&G may be competing with other brands, but it's still a basic item people will buy no matter what. The same can't be said for the beverage industry, where folks aren't simply selecting different options within, say, the soda category, but are deciding between soda and another beverage altogether, as well as whether to consume a beverage out and about or at home."", ""Some may counter by saying there's limited pricing power for Tide detergent over a non-P&G competitor like Arm & Hammer (owned by Church & Dwight). But P&G's pricing power has been in full effect this past year. Despite stagnant or even lower sales volume, P&G was still able to grow sales thanks to sizable price increases."", ""Brands matter, even for consumer staples, and P&G has proven that time and time again. At 2.5%, the yield isn't as high as Coke's. But P&G also has a better track record of buybacks than Coke, as it tends to spend about the same on buybacks as it does on the dividend."", ""To top it all off, P&G has a solid free cash flow yield of 3.9%, coincidentally the same as Coke. That means that if both companies used all their free cash flow to pay dividends, the dividend yield would be 3.9%. Basically, these are cash cow businesses that directly reward shareholders in a variety of ways. P&G severely underperformed the market last year, and I don't expect that to happen again in 2024."", ""Target carries Coke and P&G products at its stores. But it also sells several higher-margin discretionary products. Target's product mix makes it more vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of the economic cycle."", 'The retailer was hit hard by weak consumer spending, a shift in mix away from discretionary toward staples, and supply chain and inventory bottlenecks that took years to resolve. Despite rebounding (big time) from a three-year low in October, Target is still down 47% from its all-time high.', 'One of the reasons Target has recovered so much in recent months -- aside from a rebound in the overall market -- is that it finally showed signs of improvement, namely in rising margins and lower inventory.', ""The company isn't out of the woods yet. But lower interest rates in 2024 should help drive higher consumer spending and economic growth, which could do wonders for Target's margins."", 'Target should have never sold off as much as it did. The company is prone to cycles, but its long-term future is bright. Target has invested heavily in improving the store experience, e-commerce, curbside pickup, and its Target Circle rewards program. The moves have boosted customer loyalty and should help drive a stickier customer base and make the company more resilient to economic cycles.', ""Target is a Dividend King, which is a testament to its brand power and financial strength, which has allowed it to raise its payout even during challenging times. What's more, Target stock has a fairly high yield of 3.1%, the same as Coke. But Target has far more growth potential."", 'Add it all up, and Target is arguably the best Dividend King on this list for folks who can stomach a little more volatility.', ""Coke, P&G, and Target aren't companies that can outperform during a growth-led bull market. After all, it's easy to ignore a 3% dividend when the market is up double digits in a single year."", ""But the true value of these companies isn't in their performance relative to the market, but in their ability to provide investors with an income stream, no matter what the market is doing."", 'Folks looking for reliable investments to add to their portfolio should consider all three stocks now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

As of the modern day, many of these extreme events are a result of climate change.

Climate change was also found to increase the rain intensity by 50% in Libya thereby becoming partly responsible for destructive flooding which took the life of more than 3400 people. Similarly, the hot, dry, and windy conditions played an active role in the wildfires which burnt more than 18 million hectares of land in Canada.', '2024 is expected to witness extreme heat and related disasters due to ongoing climate change.

Trading for 18 times estimated 2024 earnings, shares appear more than reasonably priced, given mid-to-high single digit growth forecasts. A further renewal of appreciation for NEE’s long-term potential could mean a continued re-rating to the upside.', 'Speaking of earnings growth, don’t forget such growth also points to further increases in this “aristocrat’s” quarterly payouts.

Shares currently have an annual dividend yield of 2.48%. This payout has grown by double-digits on average each year over the past five years.', 'More importantly, atop this baseline return, is the likely continued price appreciation, driven by earnings growth. Forecasts call for Starbucks’ earnings to increase by 15.5% this fiscal year (ending September 2024), and by between 16% and 17% during the following two fiscal years after that. Not too shabby, for a stock trading for just 22.3 times forward earnings.', 'Source: RMC42/ShutterStock.com', 'When it comes to long-term dividend stocks, Snap-On (NYSE:SNA) is another name to consider.

After all, forecasts call for mixed results in the coming years. So then, why make SNA stock a “set and forget” long-term buy? While encountering a rough patch today, over a longer time frame Snap-On has demonstrated consistent profitability growth.', 'Furthermore, Snap-On beat expectations when it last reported earnings. Future results could come in much stronger than sell-side estimates suggest. Reasonably-priced at 15.2 times forward earnings, there may even be room for an expansion of SNA’s forward multiple.

That sounds like a great proposition, doesn't it? Such opportunities don't come around as often as we'd like."", 'However, I think some stocks currently offer the chance to pay less and receive more thanks to their attractive valuations and juicy dividends. Here are three ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are simply too cheap to ignore.', 'Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC) based on market cap. It provides financing to middle-market businesses with a focus on the upper tier of the market.', ""The company's dividend yield is nearly 9.5%. This sky-high yield is largely due to BDCs being required to return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends to be exempt from paying federal taxes."", ""Ares Capital's shares trade at only 8.8 times forward earnings. Its price-to-book ratio is a low 1.07. These metrics would make any stock's valuation look attractive."", ""But Ares Capital isn't cheap because it's performing poorly. The company's business is booming with core earnings per share jumping 18% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. It has also delivered total returns that topped the S&P 500 by more than 85% since its initial public offering in 2004. Ares Capital's total return has also beaten the S&P 500 in the last three-year and five-year periods as well."", 'Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) ranks as one of the largest drugmakers in the world. The company has been in business since 1849. It currently markets eight products with annual sales of $1 billion or more.', ""Big pharma stocks have long been favorites for income investors because of their strong dividends. Pfizer is no exception. That's especially the case now with its dividend yield at nearly 6%."", ""Pfizer's forward earnings multiple is 12.5, well below the healthcare sector average of nearly 18.4. This low valuation is the result of declining sales for the company's COVID-19 products and the upcoming loss of exclusivity for several top-selling drugs."", ""However, Pfizer's long-term prospects look good. The drugmaker expects to add roughly $20 billion in annual revenue by 2030 from new product launches and new indications for existing products. Business development deals could generate another $25 billion in additional annual revenue."", ""You're probably familiar with Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) even if you're not one of the company's customers. Verizon provides wireless services in the U.S. and other countries. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world."", ""Verizon's dividend yield of over 6.8% should catch investors' attention. In addition to this ultra-high yield, the company has also increased its dividend for 17 consecutive years. That's the longest streak of dividend hikes in the U.S. telecommunications industry."", 'What about valuation? Verizon looks pretty good on that front, too. Its shares currently trade at close to 8.4 times expected earnings. By comparison, the average forward earnings multiple of S&P 500 stocks in the communications services sector is 17.3.', 'To be sure, Verizon faces some challenges. The wireless market is highly competitive. However, the company appears to be headed in the right direction. Verizon reported a significant improvement in free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023. Its streaming bundle with Netflix and Max should also attract more subscribers.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

Well, according to S&P Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt, it was very important. Consider this: The Magnificent Seven -- Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- accounted for more than 60% of the S&P 500\'s total return of 26%. Indeed, if those seven stocks were excluded, the index would have only returned 7.6%, making 2023 a below-average year for the benchmark index.', ""Yet, as important as the Magnificent Seven may be, investors shouldn't get tunnel vision; there are many other stocks worthy of their attention. Let's have a look at three such names."", ""First up is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). CrowdStrike's stock is one of the top-performing Nasdaq-100 names so far this year, having registered a 12% gain as of this writing. The stock is also up almost 180% over the last 12 months."", ""And why has the stock been on fire? In short, it's down to the old rules of supply and demand. CrowdStrike is one of the world's leading cybersecurity companies. Through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the company provides its customers with cloud-based security modules that protect networks, data, and endpoints."", 'The need for this protection is increasing. Organizations are desperate to secure their digital assets due to the rapid rise in cyberattacks, ransomware, and data breaches.', ""In light of this situation, CrowdStrike's customer base is exploding, and its revenue is skyrocketing. As of its most recent quarter (the three months ended on Oct. 31, 2023), CrowdStrike reported revenue of $786 million, up 35% from a year earlier. Moreover, $733 million of that revenue -- some 93% -- was subscription-based."", 'CRWD data by YCharts', ""Those improving fundamentals are driving CrowdStrike's stock back toward its all-time high. Growth-oriented investors should take note that CrowdStrike remains primed to cash in on the rapid growth of the cybersecurity market."", 'Next is Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET). The company, which provides networking solution tools, is an under-the-radar AI play, given the importance of networking resources to the advancement of AI.', 'As the company notes in a recently published white paper available on its website, ""As AI continues to advance at unprecedented pace, networks need to adapt to the colossal growth in traffic transiting hundreds and thousands of processors with trillions of transactions and gigabits of throughput.""', 'To put it another way, as data centers and supercomputers grow larger and more complex to handle more advanced AI, the networks connecting the underlying processors will also need to improve. Fast AI requires fast networks, and Arista is one of the leaders in optimizing networks. ', ""Turning to finances, Arista Networks' key metrics are soaring. In one year, the company's free cash flow per share has increased from $1.42 to $4.77 -- an increase of 336%. That's hugely important, as free cash flow per share is one of the most important financial metrics for a stock."", 'In summary, Arista Networks is well positioned to benefit from the skyrocketing demand for AI products and systems. Moreover, its strong, improving fundamentals make it an attractive choice for growth investors willing to buy and hold.', 'Finally, we come to a personal favorite: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). ', 'In my view, there are three reasons why AMD is such an attractive stock.', 'First, there is the secular growth story. The growth of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market is, by far, the biggest reason to be bullish on AMD. These high-powered semiconductors are the chips of choice for AI developers, thanks to their ability to quickly process data.', ""Now, thanks to the introduction of its MI300 series of chips, AMD is directly competing with Nvidia in this red-hot market. Indeed, in a recent conference, AMD's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su estimated that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI-related chips will reach $400 billion over the next four years."", ""That leads to my second reason to be bullish on AMD: the company's fantastic leadership. Starting with CEO Lisa Su, AMD's management team has delivered incredible returns for AMD. In point of fact, AMD shares have gained an eye-popping 4,370% during Su's time as CEO -- meaning a $10,000 investment made on her start date of Oct. 8, 2014, would be worth a staggering $484,000 as of this writing."", ""What's more, AMD's key fundamentals can't be ignored. Over the last 12 months, the company has generated $22.1 billion in revenue, nearly double the $11.4 billion it reported three years ago."", ""Granted, valuation will be a concern for some investors. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 42 times, putting it out of reach for value investors or those otherwise uncomfortable with high-valuation stocks."", 'Nevertheless, long-term growth investors should give AMD a hard look. The AI revolution is here to stay, and AMD, with its excellent leadership and new AI-focused chips, is a stock with a bright future ahead of it.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

With the stock edging out Nvidia by gaining 246% versus Nvidia's 239% in 2023, investors might be surprised to hear that Supermicro could still be a strong buy."", ""However, after digging into the company, it's clear it still has a long runway. Furthermore, it can be purchased for a reasonable price -- something Nvidia cannot say."", 'The reason Nvidia grew so much in 2023 was the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are perfect for processing large workloads.', ""In 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) took off, causing a huge demand for Nvidia's products. However, companies can't just buy a GPU or two and call it a day. Instead, they buy hundreds or thousands of these units and connect them to create a supercomputer."", ""Most companies don't have the expertise to do this properly, so they outsource server design and production to other suppliers, which is where Supermicro fits in. Its servers are highly customizable and can be tailored to any workload size or focus; it has servers specializing in AI, engineering simulation, and drug discovery, among other purposes."", 'And it works closely with Nvidia to squeeze out every bit of performance possible from its GPUs.', 'So, with Supermicro benefiting from the same trend as Nvidia, it makes sense as an investment alternative to the latter. But its stock can be had for a more reasonable price.', ""One of the gripes with Nvidia is that it trades at a premium: 65 times trailing earnings and 40 times forward earnings. Those are high expectations, and it doesn't leave much room for error if the company doesn't hit projections."", 'On the flip side, Supermicro has a fairly reasonable valuation right now, especially when you focus on forward earnings.', ""Supermicro is expected to grow rapidly this year as the demand Nvidia experienced for its GPUs is translated into the next product in the value chain: Supermicro's servers. This will help it, along with its goal of achieving $20 billion in annual revenue (its current trailing-12-month total is $7.4 million)."", ""However, one area Supermicro doesn't have an edge over Nvidia is with its margins. Because Supermicro is assembling products and not creating them, it doesn't have as much control over the prices it charges."", ""Furthermore, its technology isn't that innovative. Anyone could launch a business that creates servers with GPUs, but starting a new GPU business from the ground up would be nearly impossible. As a result, there is some risk in Supermicro's stock since it faces stiff competition from IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise."", ""So, should that discourage investors from taking a position in Supermicro's stock? I don't think so. AI proliferation is a rising tide lifting many companies, although first-tier producers like Nvidia could benefit the most, which is why the stock has a huge premium."", 'Supermicro might not be able to control its destiny, but it sits at the crossroads of a generational technological shift, making it a great investment right now that can be purchased at a reasonable price.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

Rome wasn't built in a day and Netflix stands a long way away from that ambitious target, so let's give the company the rest of this decade to make that steep climb. Even so, what would it take to lift Netflix's stock all the way to $1 trillion by the year 2030?"", 'As a longtime Netflix shareholder and regular table-pounder concerning the company\'s bright future, I would love to slap down a quick ""yes"" and move on to the next game-changing investor question.

Soaring gains like these are indeed possible, and some market-beating winners make it look easy sometimes.', 'For instance, semiconductor designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has posted a 65% CAGR over the last decade, thanks to a 228% gain (more than a triple) in the last year alone.

As it turns out, Netflix is on that list with a 26.3% average growth rate. As I said, it can be done.', ""Then again, most of Netflix's 10-year gains materialized between 2014 and 2020. Video-streaming services were young and wild and exciting back then and Netflix had few serious challengers. It's a different ball of wax today with slower growth, price-sensitive consumers, and a plethora of rival services. The stock's CAGR in that market-stomping 5-year span works out to 48.3% while the most recent five-year increase stops at 7.2%. The slower subscriber growth in 2022 had brutal effects on this stock chart."", ""Tuesday's earnings report should clarify the company's progress with recently launched and upcoming business ideas, and the earnings call promises to be interesting.

However, the truth is that the majority of wealth from this technology will take decades to trickle through the economy and into investors' portfolios. We are in the early stages of what could be a trillion-dollar industry as soon as the end of this decade."", ""Don't pass on this opportunity because you think you need a ton of money to make money. In reality, blue chip AI stocks\xa0are already emerging, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). They all have promising AI prospects, and cost less than $500 per share."", 'Three Fool.com contributors explain below why each stock could potentially be held forever in a diversified portfolio.', 'Will Healy (Advanced Micro Devices): When it comes to dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors, investors tend to look toward Nvidia. However, that stock has been bid to nosebleed valuations, dramatically increasing the risk. It also means that investors may have a more lucrative opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).', ""It is not just that AMD's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12 compares well to the recent 31 P/S ratio of Nvidia. AMD has taken itself from the brink of bankruptcy to industry leader by successfully challenging companies like Nvidia and longtime rival Intel."", 'Moreover, the company has a huge opportunity in the AI chip market. Allied Market Research believes the AI chip market will grow to $384 billion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%, compared to a 6% CAGR over the same time frame for the overall semiconductor industry.', ""It has moved in this direction for a long time. When Lisa Su became CEO in 2014, she shifted AMD's focus to CPUs and GPUs. It so happens that the data centers that support AI depend heavily on both types of processors. The company successfully leveraged this core competency and took a lead over Intel in data center CPU market share growth in 2023."", ""Additionally, AMD has not surrendered the AI chip business to Nvidia. The AMD Instinct MI300 Series accelerators offer AI-ready technology. This includes the MI300A, an APU (accelerated processing unit) that combines the CPU and GPU in one unit. The company also designed the MI300X, claiming it is the world's most advanced generative AI accelerator."", 'Furthermore, the chip industry is coming out of a slump. To that end, analysts forecast a 41% increase in net income for the year.', ""Finally, the stock price increasingly reflects higher sales and optimism regarding the company's AI technology. Over the last year, AMD stock has risen about 125%, and that increase may be just the beginning as AMD capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom."", ""Jake Lerch (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft was, for a time, the biggest AI stock of them all, having passed Apple earlier this year to become the world's largest company with a market cap north of $2.8 trillion."", ""In large part, the surge in Microsoft's market cap can be credited to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI), and its ability to rapidly monetize those advancements."", 'Case in point: The company recently announced Copilot Pro, a $20/month package billed as a tool to help ""Supercharge your creativity and productivity."" According to the company, ""[Users will] gain priority access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo during peak times for accelerated performance to generate answers, content, and AI images even faster.""', 'Copilot Pro includes priority access to GPT-4 during peak hours, plus 100 Dall-E image boosts. Moreover, the Pro version also authorizes users to unlock AI-driven tools for Office software, allowing users to draft emails and create presentations using AI.', ""In short, Microsoft is quickly integrating AI advancements directly into its iconic software franchises -- and boosting its revenue in the process. It's another example of how the company remains at the forefront of the AI revolution and why Microsoft is an AI stock you can hold forever. "", 'Justin Pope (Palantir Technologies): Investors may not realize just how sticky Palantir\'s software can be. As Palantir describes in regulatory filings, the company aims to become the ""central operating system"" for its customers. Its software applies AI and machine learning to process large amounts of data, often from many places, to serve applications ranging from surveillance to supply chain optimization.', ""Palantir's software makes this happen, so these aren't one-time uses you can drop afterward. That's why Palantir's sales cycle has three phases. Its first phase, Acquire, is where organizations try the software at little to no cost. The latter phases, Expand and Scale, work its software deeper into organizations until they become mission-critical to how they operate."", ""This is important when considering Palantir's deep relationship with the U.S. government, arguably the only customer in the world with virtually bottomless pockets. The government is more than half of Palantir's revenue today, meaning government spending has grown with Palantir over the years. Palantir's AIP platform launched in 2023, and the system helps customers implement AI into their organizations. CEO Alex Karp has already cited\xa0customers' strong interest."", ""Both government and private sector competition seem to be moving toward a place where those who utilize their data will perform the best. Palantir's ability to help its customers get the most out of their data while becoming a central component of day-to-day operations could produce growing and resilient revenue that creates strong shareholder returns for the foreseeable future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Bottom-line results were more impressive with earnings per share increasing by 41%.

For comparison, competitor Cisco Systems trades for only 15 times earnings."", 'Fortinet is a quality business, but there could be better price points in the future.', ""For investors who follow the semiconductor and artificial intelligence (AI) spaces, news about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been unavoidable over the past year. The past two quarters (Nvidia's second and third of fiscal 2024) have featured triple-digit revenue growth."", 'This has been led by its data center segment, which saw revenue growth of 279% in the third quarter.', ""At some point, this growth will slow, but it's impossible to know when. Based on recent reports of companies continuing to buy Nvidia's most advanced chips, these impressive increases could be here for the foreseeable future."", 'In the current quarter, the company is projecting total revenue growth of more than 200%.', ""Nvidia currently trades for 75 times earnings and 81 times free cash flow. These multiples are above the company's 10-year historical average. Buying shares at these prices could work out if the growth projections hold, but considering the cyclical nature of the semiconductor space, it's reasonable to assume there will be better buying opportunities ahead."", 'Semiconductor device and software developer Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has also seen tailwinds related to AI.

Shares now trade for around 35 times earnings and 28 times free cash flow.', 'When Broadcom reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2023 results in December, the market reaction was likely due to guidance rather than reported results. Year-over-year revenue growth slowed to 4% and earnings-per-share growth slipped to 5%. Both of these growth rates have been significantly higher over the last few years.', ""On the flip side, the company's guidance suggests that 2024 will be a much better year. Fiscal 2024 revenue is expected to be $50 billion, which represents a 39% increase over the fiscal 2023 revenue of $36 billion."", 'The current price and valuation are based on growth reaccelerating in 2024, due in part to AI-related spending by its customers.', ""Today's price is not cheap, but also not incredibly expensive by Broadcom's historical valuation.

(TSMC). The surge in semiconductor stocks contributed to the upward momentum of MSCI Inc.'s Asia Pacific index for the second consecutive day. TSMC, in particular, experienced a remarkable increase of over 6% in Taiwan, while its American depository receipts saw an impressive surge of nearly 10%, reaching the highest closing level since February 2022. The noteworthy performance of TSMC has become a focal point, acting as a catalyst for heightened expectations of a global recovery within the semiconductor sector. The positive momentum in Asia reflects the broader sentiment in equity markets, driven by the resilience and growth potential perceived in key industry players. Traders' sentiments are undergoing shifts, with a notable reduction in bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated in March. This adjustment in expectations aligns with the evolving economic landscape and signals a degree of confidence in the prevailing economic conditions. Redmond Wong, Chief China Strategist, provided insights into the outlook for the world's second-largest economy, shedding light on government policies and their implications for the stock markets. These discussions underscore the importance of staying informed about global economic dynamics and geopolitical factors that influence market trends. As markets continue to respond to changing conditions, the performance of semiconductor stocks, such as TSMC, serves as a barometer for broader economic recovery sentiments. Investors and analysts will closely monitor developments in the semiconductor sector and gauge their impact on global markets in the coming days."", ""According to Reuters, the most recent economic indicators point towards a positive trajectory for the U.S. economy as of January 18, with notable developments in jobless claims and the housing market. Weekly jobless claims have reached a 16-month low, falling by 16,000 to 187,000, showcasing a robust labor market. The decline, unexpected by economists, hints at sustained job growth in January and contributes to an optimistic economic outlook, potentially complicating expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March. The strong performance is attributed to the resilience of the labor market, where companies are demonstrating reluctance to lay off workers amidst challenges in finding skilled labor, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Though some volatility in claims data is expected during the turn of the year, the overall trend aligns with a tight labor market. In the housing sector, single-family housing starts experienced an 8.6% decline in December, attributed in part to adverse weather conditions. However, the year-on-year increase of 15.8% indicates sustained demand, fueled by a shortage of existing homes for sale. Building permits for single-family homes rose by 1.7% to the highest level since May 2022, reflecting positive sentiment among homebuilders and responding to declining mortgage rates. While the housing market shows signs of resilience and increased demand for new construction, challenges persist, particularly in addressing the inventory shortage. The gap between housing starts and completion rates and the inventory gap in the market underscore the need for additional supply to alleviate the housing affordability crisis. Overall, these economic indicators provide a multifaceted view of the U.S. economy's current state, with both the labor market and the housing sector contributing to a generally positive narrative.

At that rate, the company could add 30 million ad-tier subscribers this year."", ""While that's a positive sign for Netflix, as it shows that it's attracting new subscribers and helping current subscribers stay on the platform but pay less, it's even better news for stocks that are well positioned to take advantage of the new advertising boom in connected TV.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10.', 'The term Dividend Challengers refers to publicly traded companies in the US that have consistently increased their dividend payments to shareholders for a period spanning five to less than 10 consecutive years. This category includes companies that have demonstrated a commitment to distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends over a moderate timeframe. Investors find dividend growers particularly attractive for several reasons. Historical data indicates that stocks belonging to this category have outperformed the broader market, delivering stronger returns. Moreover, these stocks tend to showcase lower levels of volatility compared to the overall market', 'T. Rowe Price conducted an analysis revealing that stocks exhibiting dividend growth within the large-cap Russell 1000 Index consistently outperformed the benchmark. This outperformance was observed both during market downturns and in more bullish periods over the 35 years concluding on December 31, 2020. The report also highlighted that, in contrast to securities relying heavily on an above-average yield for their total return, companies with the capacity to increase their cash flows and dividends consistently throughout economic cycles may counteract some of the erosive effects caused by inflation and higher interest rates. This suggests that businesses with the potential for sustained growth in cash flows and dividends may be more resilient in mitigating the impact of economic challenges, contributing to the preservation of the value of future cash flows.', 'In terms of absolute returns, dividends have historically constituted a significant portion of overall equity returns. Looking back to 1926, more than 40% of the total return of the U.S. stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, has been attributed to dividends. However, dividends offer more than just their cash value. According to findings from a report by Cohen and Steers, companies that pay dividends have shown a considerable outperformance compared to non-payers, and they have achieved this with lower volatility. The report noted that in the last decade leading up to 2010, dividend-paying stocks outpaced non-payers by an annual margin of 620 basis points, while their risk, measured by standard deviation, was notably lower. This advantage of dividend payers over non-payers extends further over a 30-year time frame.', 'For investors seeking dividend growth stocks, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$742.7m', 'US$788.8m', 'US$861.4m', 'US$916.0m', 'US$962.7m', 'US$1.00b', 'US$1.04b', 'US$1.07b', 'US$1.10b', 'US$1.13b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 6.33%', 'Est @ 5.10%', 'Est @ 4.24%', 'Est @ 3.63%', 'Est @ 3.21%', 'Est @ 2.91%', 'Est @ 2.70%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% ', 'US$694', 'US$688', 'US$702', 'US$697', 'US$684', 'US$666', 'US$645', 'US$622', 'US$598', 'US$573', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.6b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at F5 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.968. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

As a result, companies are becoming more comfortable borrowing the funds needed to acquire other firms. Given the latter situation, I expect mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the tech sector to take off tremendously this year. Indicating this phenomenon has already started, Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) earlier this month announced it agreed to acquire telecom and data center equipment provider Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) for $40 per share. Before the deal was disclosed, JNPR stock was changing hands for around $30 per share. Now, it’s selling for about $37.51.

With Apple and Disney struggling to generate strong growth, I believe they may finally shell out the large amount of funds needed to buy Roku.', 'Indeed, the one drawback to acquiring Roku is the buyer would probably have to pay at least $25 billion to get the deal done.

Additionally, Piper believes the firm, over the longer term, can benefit from “tech and channel partnerships” along with acquiring important security certification from the federal government.', 'These growth catalysts likely caused Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) to attempt buying the company recently. ZM ultimately backed out, but other firms could easily look to buy Five9.', 'FIVN stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 36, while analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to jump to $1.93 this year from $1.50 in 2023.', 'On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) could hardly be more diverse, but they all have the potential to deliver excellent returns for investors this year and for the next decade. Whirlpool's 6.1% dividend yield will catch the eye of investors looking to play the housing market recovery. Devon Energy's annualized 6.7% yield is similarly eye-catching, and the stock will suit energy investors. Meanwhile, PTC will appeal to investors looking to play the exciting long-term theme of the manufacturing sector digitizing. Here's why all three are highly attractive stocks."", ""There's no doubt Whirlpool's sales growth is under pressure. It's not just that rising interest rates crimp discretionary spending; it matters more how long they stay high. In Whirlpool's case, there's evidence its end markets are slowing. For example, in the third quarter of 2023, the company was forced to pull forward its return to the kind of promotional activity it undertook before the pandemic a couple of quarters earlier than expected."", 'These pressures will likely continue into 2024, so beware the near-term risk.', ""That said, there's nothing in its end markets that lower interest rates later in the year won't help, and lower interest rates are expected. In addition, management is cutting costs significantly, and the plan to combine its European business with appliance company Arçelik, creating a new entity in which Whirlpool will own a 25% stake, makes perfect sense. It also will allow Whirlpool to focus on its core North American market."", 'The reality is that Whirlpool has found it extremely tough to make money in Europe, but its North American business is fine. The following table illustrates the issue. Simply put, management will be freer to focus on improving North American margins to prepandemic levels.', 'Segment', '2019 EBIT Margin', '2019 EBIT', 'First 9 Months of 2023 EBIT Margin', 'First 9 Months of 2023 EBIT', 'North America', '13.3%', '$410 million', '10.1%', '$862 million', 'Europe, Middle East, and Africa', '0.9%', '$11 million', '0.9%', '$23 million', 'Latin America', '5.3%', '$42 million', '6.0%', '$146 million', 'Asia', '0.6%', '$2 million', '3.2%', '$25 million', 'Data source: Whirlpool. EBIT = earnings before interest and taxation.', ""This stock is for energy bulls and investors looking to diversify their portfolio by buying into the sector. There's no getting around the fact that Devon's earnings and cash flow, and ultimately its dividend payout, depend on movements in the price of oil and gas. (Devon pays a base dividend of $0.20 a quarter and a variable dividend that depends on its cash-flow generation and capital allocation priorities.)"", ""Although Devon's stock fell slightly more than 26% in 2023, there are a few good reasons to believe it could recover in 2024. First, as I have previously said, a big reason for the decline in earnings, cash flow, and, ultimately, dividends in 2023 came down to the dramatic slump in the price of gas. However, it's now stabilized, and the price of oil is still above $70 a barrel. Extrapolating from management's projection on the company's last earnings call, in early November, oil at $70 a barrel could result in a dividend yield of roughly 5% overall based on the current price."", ""Second, lower interest rates in 2024 (if they come) will make high-yield stocks more attractive, which means more interest in stocks like Devon Energy. Third, it's important to note the price of oil is currently above $70, yet the global economy is already slowing down. This suggests that the efforts of certain oil-producing countries to support the price by restricting supply are working."", ""While there's no guarantee the price of oil will stay at these levels, Devon's base dividend ($0.20 a quarter) is protected down to a price of $40 a barrel and that indicates a yield of around 2% at the current stock price. That's not bad."", ""This industrial software company's solutions lie at the heart of the digitization of the manufacturing sector. Its computer-aided design (CAD) software helps customers digitally create and modify designs. The products that are designed can be digitally analyzed and tested via simulation before they are built. This interface between the physical and digital worlds continues with PTC's product lifecycle management (PLM) software. Meanwhile, its Internet of Things (IoT) software digitally integrates products and assets."", 'Digital technology is revolutionizing manufacturing and helping reduce product development times while creating so-called ""closed loop"" manufacturing, whereby data is being constantly analyzed to improve production iteratively, and can even lead to adjustments to the product design.', ""These are hot concepts in modern manufacturing plants, and PTC is a leader in the field. The company continues to grow its annual run rate revenue, a figure that represents its recurring revenue, at a mid-teens growth rate, and it's likely to drop down into significantly more free-cash-flow generation in the coming years. Wall Street analysts have PTC growing its free cash flow to around $1 billion in 2026, putting the stock at a ratio of 20 times estimated 2026 free cash flow at the current price.

However, given the cyclical nature of the energy business, I believe the market may have been shortsighted and overreacted."", ""Chevron's recent acquisitions show it's positioning itself for the long haul. The PDC Energy acquisition is expected to add more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent proved reserves; Magnum Development is a partner in a project aiming to create the world's largest green hydrogen production and storage facility; and acquiring Hess further diversifies Chevron's portfolio and expands its reach in key markets like Guyana."", ""Chevron's quarterly dividend is $1.51, with a trailing-12-month yield of over 4%. Last year, Chevron's management announced it would recommend an 8% increase to its dividend. That would bring it to $1.63 per share quarterly, and bring the company's streak of increases to 37 consecutive years."", ""The return on investment for Chevron's acquisitions won't be immediate, but its healthy dividend should give investors the patience to stick around for the long haul."", ""Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) is a Canadian oil and natural gas transportation and distribution company. It's one of North America's largest energy infrastructure companies, with a pipeline network that runs all throughout the continent."", ""Last year, Enbridge's stock dropped by around 9%. It made its own high-priced acquisition, buying three natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy for $14 billion, but investors weren't pleased, and the stock dropped by close to 6% on the day that deal was announced."", ""Investors' valid concern relates to how the deal adds more to Enbridge's debt level, which is already higher than is preferable. For dividend investors, that's even more concerning because they want to be sure the company will be able to continue to cover its current payouts and increase them. However, shareholders shouldn't have to worry about that with Enbridge."", ""Enbridge has increased its quarterly dividend for 29 straight years, and should maintain that streak. With a dividend yield of around 7.3% ($0.67 per share quarterly), it's one of the more lucrative payouts you can find. The company has also hiked its dividend at a compound annual rate of 10%."", ""The company's debt shouldn't be ignored, but its focus is on growing its scale and positioning for the future. Investors might not have liked the Dominion Energy deal, but it made Enbridge North America's largest natural gas utility franchise."", ""Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) wasn't able to dodge the stock price downdraft that hit many energy companies. The oil and natural gas exploration and production company finished 2023 with its share down by more than 26%."", ""Devon Energy doesn't have your typical dividend structure. It pays a base amount (currently $0.77 per share) plus a variable amount that's based on the company's quarterly cash flows. Unfortunately, this means Devon Energy's dividend fluctuates with the price of oil, since that has a direct effect on the company's cash flow."", ""Even with the fluctuating dividend, it's a good option for income-seeking investors. Its current yield is 6.7%, which is higher than its five-year average, even though oil prices dipped somewhat in 2023."", ""Operationally, oil production continues to grow for Devon Energy.

Further, Buffett has overseen an annualized return that practically doubles up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500 since the mid-1960s."", ""Warren Buffett's overwhelming success means he has a veritable army of professional and everyday investors who wait on the edge of their seats to discover what he's been buying and selling."", ""Money managers and investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter."", ""Although buying and selling activity shown within a 13F shouldn't be construed as a buy or sell recommendation from institutional money managers, investors may use the historic trading activity of Wall Street's top minds (like Buffett) as a reason to enter or exit a position."", ""As an example, Warren Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have built a gargantuan position in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since the first quarter of 2016. Through Jan. 12, Apple accounted for 47% of Berkshire Hathaway's $361 billion investment portfolio, and it's been a company that the Oracle of Omaha and his team have added to with some frequency over the past eight years."", 'But even though Buffett has sung Apple\'s praises for its more than $600 billion worth of buybacks, and referred to his company\'s top investment holding as ""a better business than any we own"" during Berkshire Hathaway\'s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, he\'s never advocated that investors buy Apple stock.', ""Buffett is also a huge fan of financial stocks that benefit from the long-term expansion of the U.S. economy. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is the type of business that should be able to grow its loan portfolio over time and enjoy incremental increases in net interest income as lending rates normalize from historic lows. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks."", ""However, Warren Buffett has never suggested that investors purchase shares of his company's second-largest holding (BofA)."", ""Despite strongly advocating that investors not bet against America, Buffett doesn't make specific investment suggestions -- with one exception."", ""When the page turned to 2024, Berkshire Hathaway had stakes in 51 securities. None of the 49 stocks in Berkshire's portfolio have been suggested as buys from the Oracle of Omaha. However, the two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Berkshire holds stakes in -- the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) -- are buy suggestions made by Warren Buffett for everyday investors."", ""In an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick in 2017, Buffett had this to say when questioned about where investors should put their money to work:"", ""I think it's the same thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time, and that is to consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund. Keep buying it through thick and thin -- and especially through thin. The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, 'Well, maybe I should skip a year,' or something. Just keep buying. American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well."", ""The Oracle of Omaha is well aware that downturns in the U.S. economy and stock market are inevitable. But he astutely recognizes that economic weakness and stock market corrections have a tendency to be short-lived. That's why he believes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust make for surefire buys."", 'Since the end of World War II, the U.S. economy has navigated its way through a dozen recessions. Nine of these 12 downturns ended in less than a year, with the remaining three failing to surpass 18 months. By comparison, most periods of economic expansion have lasted multiple years, with two expansions cresting the decade mark since 1945.', ""It's official. A new bull market is confirmed.The S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.Read more at https://t.co/H4p1RcpfIn. pic.twitter.com/tnRz1wdonp"", '-- Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) June 8, 2023', ""It's the same story for equities on Wall Street. A dataset released in June by researchers at Bespoke Investment Group showed that the average S&P 500 bear market dating back to the start of the Great Recession in September 1929 lasted just 286 calendar days, or roughly 9.5 months. That compares to the typical bull market for the S&P 500 over the past 94 years of 1,011 calendar days, or approximately two years and nine months."", ""Best of all, time is an undefeated ally of investors when it comes to the benchmark S&P 500. Every year, the analysts at Crestmont Research update an extensive dataset that examines the rolling 20-year total returns of the S&P 500. Though the S&P didn't exist until 1923, its components could be found in other major indexes dating back to the start of the 20th century. This allowed the researchers at Crestmont to back-test their total returns data to 1900 and examine 105 separate rolling 20-year periods (1919-2023)."", ""The key takeaway of Crestmont's dataset is that there hasn't been a rolling 20-year period that would have resulted in an investor losing money dating back more than a century. Whereas you can count on one hand how many rolling 20-year periods ended with an annualized total return of 3% to 5%, more than 50 of the 105 ending years produced annualized total returns ranging from 9% to 17.1%. History shows that if you hold an S&P 500 tracking index for 20 years, you'll generate a profit every time."", 'Although both of the S&P 500 index funds Berkshire owns very closely mirror the performance of the S&P 500, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a slight edge over the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust in the cost department. The former sports a net expense ratio of just 0.03% (a $0.30 fee for every $1,000 invested), while the latter has a net expense ratio of 0.09% (a $0.90 fee for every $1,000 invested). While both are ultralow, all things considered, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is going to allow investors to hang onto more of their principal and investment gains over time.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn't one of them.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$318.2m', 'US$340.4m', 'US$357.4m', 'US$372.2m', 'US$385.6m', 'US$397.8m', 'US$409.3m', 'US$420.3m', 'US$431.0m', 'US$441.5m', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 5.00%', 'Est @ 4.16%', 'Est @ 3.58%', 'Est @ 3.17%', 'Est @ 2.89%', 'Est @ 2.69%', 'Est @ 2.55%', 'Est @ 2.45%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% ', 'US$294', 'US$290', 'US$281', 'US$270', 'US$258', 'US$245', 'US$233', 'US$220', 'US$209', 'US$197', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.5b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tripadvisor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.236. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

So even after the past year's good news, with inflation coming down and unemployment remaining low, many stocks still look undervalued even after strong one-year runs."", ""So where to put new money into your portfolio, IRA, or 401(k) today? Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is always a good place to look for rock-solid stocks with staying power."", 'Heading into 2024, the following three Buffett holdings look undervalued.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock was up a whopping 81% in 2023, but is almost 20% below its all-time high. Moreover, the company's price-to-sales ratio is actually at a relative low compared with the past five years."", ""Why hasn't Amazon appreciated to all-time highs, as some other Magnificent Seven stocks have? Probably because the company hasn't been perceived as a leader in the artificial-intelligence race."", 'But that could be short-sighted. The recent turmoil at OpenAI, which has exclusivity with Amazon rival Microsoft, has spurred large enterprises to diversify their artificial-intelligence application providers, according to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal. Amazon Web Services should be a key beneficiary, as the largest cloud platform out there with the most diverse selection of large language models and partners through its new Amazon Bedrock service.', ""It's hard to say which large language model will be the most used, or which AI chipset will dominate the industry. There will probably be multiple successful AI models and a variety of semiconductors that may be optimized for certain applications."", 'Amazon has a long tradition of taking on competitive industries and then using its scale and innovation to increase choice and drive down costs. After doing that across various retail categories and consumer services, Amazon looks to do the same with AI. As with e-commerce, Amazon is also developing its own lower-cost ""private label"" products and services, with its Graviton, Inferentia, and Trainium in-house-designed semiconductors, and even its own in-house large language model, called Titan.', ""Basically, I don't believe Amazon has lost any of its competitive fervor or ability to innovate in the age of AI. At a relatively low valuation relative to history, it's a great buy to start the new year."", ""The economy has proved more resilient than many expected, and it's shown up in the results of credit card issuer and card network American Express (NYSE: AXP). The curious thing about American Express stock is that it garners a majority of its business from payment volumes and card fees, which are not dependent on underwriting loans. Yet at 16.9 times trailing earnings, the stock trades more like other large banks, and not card network rivals Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which trade at 32 and 37 times earnings, respectively."", ""But only 22% of American Express' revenues come from net interest income on loans and card receivables. Therefore, one might think AmEx would trade at a higher multiple than it does. This is especially true as the company's lending book has also shown very strong results."", ""Last quarter, American Express' net write-off rate remained at 1.8%, consistent with the prior quarter and still below the 2.2% write-off rate of the fourth quarter 2019 before the pandemic, when interest rates were much lower. Meanwhile, the company's payments volume continues to grow faster than GDP at 7%, thanks to inflation-protected spending and increasing card use. And AmEx has showcased its pricing power too, with card fees up 20% year-over-year-last quarter."", 'American Express has done a great job of pivoting its classic premium brand to suit the needs of millennial and Gen Z customers, with over 60% of new accounts coming from these demographics. That has come from understanding what perks these age cohorts want, and delivering it. As further evidence, J.D. Power just selected American Express as the No. 1 credit card company for the fourth year in a row.', ""In the second quarter of 2023, Buffett or his lieutenants made a big bet on three different U.S. homebuilders, but the vast majority of the investment went to just one of those names: D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI). That may be because D.R. Horton is the largest homebuilder in the country and Buffett needs to buy large stocks to make a dent in Berkshire's portfolio. But there's also a compelling case for D.R. Horton specifically in today's industry climate."", 'First on the investing thesis behind homebuilders generally. One, these stocks tend to trade at low multiples. Even after rising over 70% in 2023, D.R. Horton only trades at 11.2 times earnings today.', 'Homebuilders have tended to trade at low valuations, because of their perceived cyclicality and sensitivity to interest rates, as well as their traditional capital intensity with having to buy land up front. But Buffett seems to be making a bet that those multiples will rise.', 'There are a few good reasons for this. First, the homebuilding industry has become more concentrated, with the top 10 builders making up about 50% of all new homes built today. Moreover, top builders are using options to buy land these days, rather than outright purchases, decreasing the need for up-front capital investment and allowing for greater returns on equity.', ""And conditions may be especially favorable for homebuilders today within the housing market. There has been an undersupply of new homes built over the past 10 years, putting a floor under prices. Meanwhile, since mortgage rates have gone up so much from the pandemic and pre-pandemic low-rate era, homeowners with existing fixed rates aren't moving very much. The lack of existing homes for sale are tightening the market even further, leaving more and more of available supply coming from newly built homes."", ""That leaves conditions very favorable for homebuilders, provided, of course, buyers can still afford homes. Many buyers, especially first-timers, have been priced out of markets. But that's also why D.R. Horton specifically may find itself in a favorable position, with its focus on affordable and quick move-in homes, with more than half its customers in the form of first-time buyers. And because of Horton's scale, it can probably out-price smaller homebuilders with perks such as mortgage rate buy-downs."", ""That's why D.R. Horton has posted a string of earning beats over the past year, increased its dividend by 20% last quarter, and upped guidance for share repurchases in the upcoming year. Expect more good things from this new Buffett stock in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Two of Berkshire's top public equity holdings are oil and gas stocks, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Berkshire also owns 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a stake worth more than its Chevron and Occidental positions combined. It's safe to say that Berkshire likes the energy sector. But it doesn't own the most valuable U.S.-based oil and gas company, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM)."", ""If you like ExxonMobil, there's a good chance Chevron and Occidental may be two worthy dividend stocks worth loading up on in January. Here's why all three companies could be worth buying now."", ""ExxonMobil is slated to report its Q4 and full-year 2023 earnings on Feb. 2. And while the results probably won't be as good as ExxonMobil's record 2022, 2023 should still be the second-best year in the last decade."", ""What's more impressive than this year's results is ExxonMobil's plan to grow earnings by $14 billion from year-end 2023 through 2027, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60."", 'For context, Brent prices average $100.93 in 2022 and $82.49 in 2023. So how is ExxonMobil planning to substantially grow earnings, even at a much lower oil price? The short answer is cost reduction, portfolio optimization, added earnings from its not-yet-completed acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and growing production from key profitable plays, namely offshore Guyana and the Permian Basin.', ""There's a lot to like about ExxonMobil's plan:"", 'It assumes a fairly mediocre oil price.', 'It holds the company accountable, not just for a few quarters or this year, but for several years out.', 'It leaves room for $20 billion in lower emissions opportunities.', 'It includes ongoing dividend raises.', 'And it pencils in $20 billion per year in stock buybacks.', 'The oil and gas industry is prone to big upside and downside swings. But ExxonMobil has the balance sheet capable of weathering the storm. If oil drops below $60 a barrel for Brent, the first move ExxonMobil would likely make is to pull back on stock repurchases. After that, it could reduce capital expenditures.', 'Oil would have to fall very far and stay down for a while for ExxonMobil to get derailed or cut the dividend. ExxonMobil has increased its dividend for 41 consecutive years, putting it on track to become a Dividend King by 2032.', 'Over the last 15 years, ExxonMobil and Chevron have been trading places between which company is spending more money and has more debt and which company is being conservative. In the mid-2010s, Chevron was spending a fortune on its Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which was completed over budget. After Wheatstone delivered its first cargo in 2017, Chevron pulled back on spending.', 'At the same time, ExxonMobil ramped up its spending in the years leading up to the pandemic, which left it more vulnerable than Chevron. In 2020, ExxonMobil booked its worst annual loss in company history, losing $22.4 billion, which was four times as much as Chevron.', 'But over the last three years, ExxonMobil has turned things around. Now both companies have excellent balance sheets and low costs of production, with ExxonMobil lowering its net debt position from $61.6 billion three years ago to under $10 billion today and Chevron reducing its net debt position from $38.2 billion down to $14.6 billion. Not to mention, both companies had a 25% or higher debt-to-capital ratio, which is also far lower today.', 'Like ExxonMobil, Chevron is investing in low-carbon fuels to diversify its portfolio and capitalize on the energy transition. Last January, Chevron announced its 36th consecutive year of dividend increases, so we should expect Chevron to comment on the dividend or maybe even announce a raise before it reports earnings on Feb. 2.', ""Even without factoring in a raise, Chevron yields 4.1%, slightly higher than ExxonMobil's 3.8%."", ""Berkshire bought more shares of Occidental stock in December, solidifying the company as Berkshire's sixth-largest public equity holding, right behind fifth-place Chevron. And while Berkshire has steadily trimmed its Chevron stake for over a year now, it continues to load up on more shares of Occidental."", 'Unlike Exxon and Chevron, Occidental is an exploration and production (E&P) company focused on the upstream side of oil and gas rather than the entire integrated value chain. This focus gives Occidental more potential upside from oil, but more potential downside as well. The five-year chart of Occidental is hard to believe.', 'Occidental has rebounded to around the same level it was trading at five years ago. But during 2020, Occidental stock fell below $10 a share, and there were fears it would go bankrupt. If oil prices had stayed depressed for an extended period, it very well could have, as Occidental was banking on a high oil price after it took on a lot of debt to buy fellow E&P Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. Fortunately, oil prices rebounded toward the end of 2020 and then soared in 2022.', ""Occidental has spent the last few years using outsized profits to shore up its balance sheet. But it isn't afraid to make big bets. In December, Occidental announced a $12 billion acquisition of fellow Permian oil and gas producer CrownRock."", ""Unlike ExxonMobil, which is buying Pioneer Natural Resources with stock, and Chevron, which is making its $53 billion Hess acquisition with stock, Occidental is taking on $9.1 billion of new debt and assuming $1.2 billion of CrownRock's existing debt. Just like with Anadarko, Occidental is using leverage to unlock explosive potential profits, while also leaving itself more vulnerable to a downturn."", ""Occidental is a far riskier investment than Exxon and Chevron. But it's still an oil stock worth buying if you believe oil can stay at least above $70 a barrel WTI -- the level where Occidental claims it can make $1 billion in additional free cash flow."", ""Occidental's dividend only yields 1.2%, far lower than Exxon or Chevron. Again, the point of investing in Occidental isn't to collect a stable and reliable dividend or achieve diversification. It's to bet on the strength of the U.S. upstream oil and gas industry."", ""Before investing in oil and gas, it's important first to determine which part of the integrated value chain you like the most."", 'Upstream companies like Occidental tend to offer the highest risk but also the highest potential reward. Midstream companies are known for their slow growth and high dividend yields. The downstream industry is also chock-full of quality dividend payers. And integrated majors like ExxonMobil and Chevron have sizable downstream segments as well.', ""If you're just starting out, it's hard to go wrong with a well-rounded play like ExxonMobil or Chevron. But if you are looking for an upstream candidate to add to an existing portfolio of oil and gas stocks, Occidental looks like a good buy now, too."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?', 'Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ExxonMobil wasn't one of them.

Comparable-store sales were up just 7% in the three quarters that ended in late October, the company said in late November, down from a 16% increase a year earlier.

The biotech company has reached three milestones in just a couple of months. First, back in November, the U.K. authorized Casgevy for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, the world's first regulatory nod for a CRISPR gene editing-based therapeutic. Then, in two separate decisions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved the gene editing treatment for the blood disorders."", ""Casgevy is CRISPR Therapeutics' very first product and has blockbuster potential. So, all of this is major news that should lead to revenue growth. CRISPR Therapeutics and partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals are now rolling out the treatment in the U.S. and the U.K. and waiting for additional regulatory decisions in other countries. So, at this key moment in CRISPR Therapeutics' story, could you set yourself off on the path to millions if you invest? Let's find out."", 'First, a bit of background on CRISPR Therapeutics\' technology. The company is a specialist in the field of gene editing, or the fixing of faulty genes responsible for disease. The CRISPR technique cuts DNA at a specific location and allows a natural repair process to take place. CRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats"" of genetic information and is based on a technique bacteria use to fight off viruses.', ""CRISPR Therapeutics' entire pipeline is based on this technique, so a regulatory nod represents great news for not only Casgevy but also other potential products moving forward. Regulators often are extra cautious about new technologies, so it is a big step forward that they've signed off on this one."", ""What should we expect from Casgevy? First, it's important to note that sickle cell and beta thalassemia have limited treatment options today, and Casgevy is a one-time curative therapy. These two points could spark demand for this new product."", ""That said, revenue won't take off overnight. The Casgevy treatment process takes several months, requiring steps such as collecting blood stem cells and receiving chemotherapy. That means it will take time to sign up patients, escort them through the treatment journey, and generate revenue."", ""But over time, the product could reach blockbuster status. Goldman Sachs analysts predict the treatment may bring in as much as $3.9 billion in peak sales, Bloomberg reported. CRISPR Therapeutics takes 40% of the profit, leaving the rest to Vertex, according to the companies' partnership agreement. Even this lower percentage represents a big step for CRISPR Therapeutics, though, and could help the company -- which already is in a favorable financial situation, with more than $1.7 billion in cash -- fund pipeline development."", 'Regarding pipeline, CRISPR Therapeutics may launch other game-changing products down the road. The company has narrowed its immuno-oncology focus to two next-generation candidates that may be more efficacious and easier to manufacture than earlier candidates. CRISPR Therapeutics is studying them in clinical trials and expects to report an update from those studies this year.', 'At the same time, CRISPR Therapeutics has expanded into the area of autoimmune diseases and aims to launch a clinical trial in systemic lupus erythematosus in the first half of this year.', ""Now, let's get back to our question. Could investing in this innovative gene editing company help you become a millionaire down the road? The shares are on fire right now, rising 39% over the past three months."", ""But even if this momentum continues, an investment in CRISPR Therapeutics alone is unlikely to bring you millions of dollars. For example, if you put $10,000 into the stock and the shares climb 50%, your investment would be worth $15,000. That's great, but it's far from $1 million."", ""This doesn't mean you should turn your back on CRISPR Therapeutics, though. You're unlikely to reach millionaire status with any single stock -- even the most promising. Instead, through investing in many companies and holding on over time, you could reach your goal of becoming a millionaire. And as part of this kind of diversified, well-constructed portfolio, CRISPR Therapeutics, with plenty of potential for gains over the long term, could help you along the path to wealth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

So, let's dive in and see how these industry giants could put some pep in your investments, mixing tried-and-true methods with innovative twists that could really quench your thirst for solid returns."", ""Coca-Cola isn't just about that famous soda we all know. It's a global powerhouse with a knack for mixing things up in the beverage industry. Beyond the classic Coke, it's got a lineup that's as varied as our taste buds. Think Fairlife's nutritious milk and Costa Coffee's rich brews. These brands are Coca-Cola's way of showing it's not just sticking to the old script; it's out there, exploring new flavors and trends. It's Coke's way of staying ahead in the game, catering to everyone, everywhere."", ""Coca-Cola's most recent quarterly performance delivered a robust 8% leap in net revenue to a cool $12 billion, coupled with earnings per share (EPS) jumping to $0.71, delivering a 9% increase alongside an 11% surge in organic revenue. These numbers demonstrate Coca-Cola's knack for smart pricing and thriving in diverse market conditions, making it a standout pick for investors seeking both profit and stability."", 'But Coca-Cola goes beyond selling sodas to establish its dominance. Its splash at the FIFA Women\'s World Cup 2023 put its products front and center in that community, a strategic move that bolstered its share in the bustling nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sector, delivering outsize gains in the Asia Pacific region during the event. Coca-Cola said it crafted ""an innovative campaign to build on the legacy of the tournament and celebrate the changing narrative occurring in women’s football. In football fields across both co-host nations, Australia and New Zealand, Coca‑Cola has displayed and activated five powerful statements showing the progress being made."". In a beverage market where standing out is as tough as it gets, Coca-Cola once again shows it knows how to play the game and win.', ""And let's not forget how Coca-Cola stands tall against market ups and downs. With an armory of diverse products and a strong global footprint, it navigates currency swings and competition with ease. And don't forget its dividend track record -- more than 60 years of consecutive dividend growth and the stock is currently yielding around 3% and dishing out $1.84 per share annually. For anyone looking to mix some reliability into their investment blend, Coca-Cola continues serving up just the right flavor."", ""PepsiCo, renowned for its sodas like Pepsi and Mountain Dew, maintains a dominant presence in the snack world with popular names like Lay's, Doritos, and Quaker. This strategic fusion of snack and beverage brands secures a stable revenue stream and further enhances PepsiCo's resilience in a competitive market."", 'PepsiCo turned heads last quarter with a hefty 6.7% jump in net revenue, crossing the $23 billion mark, alongside a remarkable 16% uptick in EPS. What does this tell investors? Simply put, PepsiCo proves a master when it comes to steering through economic twists and turns while keeping its profit game strong, making it a choice pick for those eyeing a reliable investment.', 'PepsiCo always seems to be on the move, tuning into what consumers want. Think about the move to offer healthier snacks and jumping into the energy drink scene with its 2020 acquisition of Rockstar. This strategic alignment keeps it in sync with changing tastes and lifestyles. By diversifying its lineup, PepsiCo surges ahead of the curve.', ""Through the rough tides of global supply chain hiccups and stiff competition, PepsiCo navigates with a steady hand. Its focus on being efficient and smart in its operations and marketing keeps it sailing ahead. Looking forward, PepsiCo isn't just promising more of the same; it's plotting a course for growth and resilience, making Pepsi a name to bet on in the ever-shifting landscape of the beverage and snack market."", 'The Boston Beer Company, known for its iconic Samuel Adams beer, breaks the traditional brewery boundaries with its ""beyond beer"" category, delivering game changers including Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea.', ""In the third quarter of 2023, Boston Beer reported a net revenue increase, breaking the $601 million mark, a modest 0.9% rise. But diluted earnings per share soared to $3.70, marking a solid 9% surge. Don't forget the impressive gross margin, which now stands at a healthy 45.7%. So, while the revenue growth might not be a tea party, these numbers demonstrate it's got the knack for managing costs effectively and keeping the profits flowing, even when the market throws challenges its way."", ""The company's strategic focus on brands like Twisted Tea and Hard Mountain Dew delivered. Twisted Tea, for instance, has consistently gained popularity, becoming a leading brand in the flavored malt beverage category. Hard Mountain Dew, a recent venture with PepsiCo, is also showing promising growth."", ""Boston Beer has faced its share of challenges, with fluctuating shipment volumes and competitive pressures in the craft beer segment at the fore. However, its proactive approach toward developing strong margins and investing wisely in diverse brands has helped mitigate these issues. Its third-quarter results include no debt, a stunning feat from a company that also holds over $310 million in cash reserves. Boston Beer's strong balance sheet gives the company the resilience to overcome minor hurdles and continue to grow."", ""Looking into 2024, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Boston Beer shine as top-notch investment contenders. With their remarkable track records, these beverage companies bring a fusion of financial strength, innovative strategies, and adaptability to the table.

Recent commentary from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) management perfectly illustrates the fundamental shift it\'s talking about.', 'As one of the biggest consumer goods companies in the world, Coca-Cola naturally spends a lot of money on advertising. But in the third quarter of 2023, management shared a surprising statistic: In 2019, 30% of its media spend was dedicated to digital media. In comparison, it spent a whopping 60% on digital channels through the first three quarters of 2023.', ""In just three years, Coca-Cola has essentially doubled the money it's spending on digital advertising. This is the fundamental shift that The Trade Desk has harped on for years, and it has big implications for investors."", ""Coca-Cola knows how much it's spending on digital advertising and why. According to CEO James Quincey, members of the Gen Z generation spend seven to nine hours on screens every day. They aren't spending nearly that amount of time watching traditional TV."", ""Quincey isn't necessarily saying that Gen Z streams that much video content. After all, screen time takes many forms, including video, gaming, social media, and more. But seven to nine hours of daily screen time demands a shift in advertising strategy to reach them. That's why Coca-Cola is spending more on digital than ever before."", ""It's not just Coca-Cola -- virtually all companies are finding themselves in this same situation. And they're increasingly turning to The Trade Desk to help solve the problem."", ""The Trade Desk partners with advertising agencies and brands to help them buy available digital ad slots -- that's why it's called a buy-side (or demand-side) adtech platform. However, the company also enables programmatic advertising, which is significant."", ""In the past, almost everyone could be reached the same way -- there were only so many broadcast TV stations. Today, Gen Z is on their screens more than ever. But that screen time is spread out among a lot of services and platforms. Therefore, advertisers have a really hard time making sure they reach the people they're trying to reach."", ""This is where The Trade Desk's programmatic advertising comes in. Advertisers can determine which demographics they want to reach and only display ads to them. In theory, two people could be viewing the same digital content but see two completely different ads. Therefore, advertisers waste less and hopefully achieve better results."", ""Brands are shifting spend from traditional methods to digital channels via programmatic advertising at an incredible pace. This is why The Trade Desk's growth consistently outpaces the industry."", ""For example, The Trade Desk continues to grow quarterly revenue at more than 20% year over year. That's slowed considerably from its peak growth rate, as the chart below shows. But in the past year, growth has slowed considerably for all adtech companies. The Trade Desk's growth continues to outpace most, which is encouraging."", ""The Trade Desk is a high-growth company, and it still has plenty of room to grow. In 2023, it's on pace to generate just shy of $2 billion in full-year revenue. This is a small percentage of what management believes is an $830 billion (and growing) global opportunity."", ""The Trade Desk stock isn't cheap -- it trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 18, whereas many stocks trade at a fraction of that valuation. However, the opportunity is large, and the company is growing fast. Coca-Cola and others are shifting dollars toward digital media at an impressive pace, and the shift is ongoing.

But Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Target (NYSE: TGT) all lost value last year despite the S&P 500's gain of 24%. However, all three companies are Dividend Kings, having paid and raised their dividends for over 50 consecutive years."", ""Investors looking for safe, out-of-favor stocks have come to the right place.

There's no word yet on a dividend increase. But history shows that Coke tends to raise its dividend in February. Investors should expect the quarterly dividend to rise to at least $0.48 per share, which would mark the company's 62nd year of consecutive dividend increases."", 'The dividend is a big reason to own Coke stock. Even without assuming a dividend raise, Coke yields 3.1%, which is higher than the average stock in the S&P 500. Using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust as a benchmark, the S&P 500 yields just 1.4%.', ""Coke has a resilient business model that can perform well regardless of the market cycle. But this advantage can also be a disadvantage, as Coke doesn't have a lot of upside even if the economy is thriving."", 'To achieve steady growth over time, Coke has to grow case volumes (sales), justify price increases, and operate a portfolio of successful brands while also adding brands to the mix to retain market share and diversify into new beverage categories. Overall, Coke has executed this strategy very well.', ""In the chart, you can see that Coke's revenue is just now returning to levels seen a decade ago. The difference today is that Coke has far higher operating margins, so it's making much more operating income per dollar of sales."", 'Part of Coke\'s future success will depend on an effective marketing campaign. The company\'s ""Raising the Bar: Marketing & Innovation"" presentation in third-quarter 2023 gave investors details of what to expect from Coke in the years to come. Coke recognizes that people have changing preferences. To maintain its market share, it has to grow its non-soda portfolio while not overspending on marketing and advertising at the expense of margins.', ""Overall, Coke seems to have a good handle on what it needs to do to keep delivering shareholder returns over time. The brand is strong, the portfolio is diverse, the dividend is solid, and the valuation isn't terrible, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.5."", 'Overall, Coke is a reliable passive income source and a worthy addition to any portfolio.', ""Procter & Gamble is very similar to Coke because it is a Dividend King that can perform well in a weak economy. And although Coke is considered a consumer staple company, soda, tea, coffee, and energy drinks aren't necessities in the same way as household essentials like toothpaste, detergent, toilet paper, and diapers are."", 'I like Coke, but I love P&G. The simple reason is that P&G is truly diversified. Whereas Coke covers different parts of the beverage category, P&G sells many different household staples, including beauty and grooming, healthcare, baby, feminine, and family care products, and fabric and home care.', ""For example, in a category like toilet paper, P&G may be competing with other brands, but it's still a basic item people will buy no matter what. The same can't be said for the beverage industry, where folks aren't simply selecting different options within, say, the soda category, but are deciding between soda and another beverage altogether, as well as whether to consume a beverage out and about or at home."", ""Some may counter by saying there's limited pricing power for Tide detergent over a non-P&G competitor like Arm & Hammer (owned by Church & Dwight). But P&G's pricing power has been in full effect this past year. Despite stagnant or even lower sales volume, P&G was still able to grow sales thanks to sizable price increases."", ""Brands matter, even for consumer staples, and P&G has proven that time and time again. At 2.5%, the yield isn't as high as Coke's. But P&G also has a better track record of buybacks than Coke, as it tends to spend about the same on buybacks as it does on the dividend."", ""To top it all off, P&G has a solid free cash flow yield of 3.9%, coincidentally the same as Coke. That means that if both companies used all their free cash flow to pay dividends, the dividend yield would be 3.9%. Basically, these are cash cow businesses that directly reward shareholders in a variety of ways. P&G severely underperformed the market last year, and I don't expect that to happen again in 2024."", ""Target carries Coke and P&G products at its stores. But it also sells several higher-margin discretionary products. Target's product mix makes it more vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of the economic cycle."", 'The retailer was hit hard by weak consumer spending, a shift in mix away from discretionary toward staples, and supply chain and inventory bottlenecks that took years to resolve. Despite rebounding (big time) from a three-year low in October, Target is still down 47% from its all-time high.', 'One of the reasons Target has recovered so much in recent months -- aside from a rebound in the overall market -- is that it finally showed signs of improvement, namely in rising margins and lower inventory.', ""The company isn't out of the woods yet. But lower interest rates in 2024 should help drive higher consumer spending and economic growth, which could do wonders for Target's margins."", 'Target should have never sold off as much as it did. The company is prone to cycles, but its long-term future is bright. Target has invested heavily in improving the store experience, e-commerce, curbside pickup, and its Target Circle rewards program. The moves have boosted customer loyalty and should help drive a stickier customer base and make the company more resilient to economic cycles.', ""Target is a Dividend King, which is a testament to its brand power and financial strength, which has allowed it to raise its payout even during challenging times. What's more, Target stock has a fairly high yield of 3.1%, the same as Coke. But Target has far more growth potential."", 'Add it all up, and Target is arguably the best Dividend King on this list for folks who can stomach a little more volatility.', ""Coke, P&G, and Target aren't companies that can outperform during a growth-led bull market. After all, it's easy to ignore a 3% dividend when the market is up double digits in a single year."", ""But the true value of these companies isn't in their performance relative to the market, but in their ability to provide investors with an income stream, no matter what the market is doing."", 'Folks looking for reliable investments to add to their portfolio should consider all three stocks now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

In this article, we decided to focus on Incyte's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Incyte ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Incyte is:', '8.6% = US$425m ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""At first glance, Incyte's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 18%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Incyte grew its net income at a significant rate of 29% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Incyte's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 18% in the same period, which is great to see."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Incyte fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."", ""Incyte doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above."", ""In total, it does look like Incyte has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth.

He made his fortune by co-founding tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). However, he began transitioning away from the company in 2008 to focus his attention full-time on his charitable organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.', 'The foundation has a portfolio of stocks -- worth roughly $39 billion as of this writing -- to help fund its efforts. For investors, it may seem like a good idea to dissect this portfolio as a source of investing insight.', ""However, investing is a personal journey. And while one can learn from other investors, it's important to understand how personal situations can differ. Only once the differences are appreciated can one draw insight from the foundation's portfolio."", 'Most of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation portfolio is invested in just five stocks: Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway\xa0(NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE: CNI), Waste Management (NYSE: WM), and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT).', ""These five positions make up 86% of the foundation's holdings, a top-heavy concentration one doesn't typically see in a well-diversified portfolio. In fact, it's even more concentrated than it first looks: Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway stock comprise 52% of the total value."", 'Four of these five stocks also pay a dividend with Berkshire Hathaway being the only exception.', ""Therefore, investors looking for inspiration might conclude they should build a similarly concentrated portfolio of dividend-paying stocks if they want to succeed in the market. But that's the wrong takeaway here."", ""In the first place, these stocks don't all represent investment choices made by the portfolio managers for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates donated Microsoft stock, and his close friend Warren Buffett donated Berkshire Hathaway stock. That's why these two stocks make up so much of the holdings."", ""For most investors, it's far better to diversify a portfolio into at least 25 stocks. Such diversification protects investors from excessive downside risk in any one stock."", ""But on the flip side, the portfolio for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation isn't a good model for most investors because it might be excessively conservative."", ""Most of these five stocks are dependable blue chip companies. There's nothing wrong with that, but for investors with a long time horizon, it's good to also allocate a major portion of a portfolio toward higher growth opportunities."", ""For a non-profit organization such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, preserving capital is crucial. When looking at 10-year returns for these five stocks, their shares have rarely dipped into the negative at any point. They've pulled back from their highs, but they've rarely ever dipped enough for the investment to be in the negative."", 'This is true of many of the blue chip dividend stocks. Not all outperform the S&P 500, but few dip into negative territory.', 'This is important when thinking about portfolio construction. Investors might want to invest 1% or 2% in an opportunity with high upside potential but elevated downside risk. In contrast, anchoring a portfolio to a consistent dividend payer could provide a good foundation for the overall portfolio.', ""Waste Management is a good example of a stock that can be foundational to a portfolio. The company takes care of trash around the U.S., and it has a real competitive advantage. For example, as of the end of 2022, it owned or operated 259 landfills. When thinking about local permitting for landfills and their proximity to where trash is collected, it's hard for any competitor to come in and duplicate Waste Management's business."", ""The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's situation is a good reminder of how important a solid company like Waste Management is to a portfolio. Investors looking for growth wouldn't want to concentrate too much of their holdings in this kind of company, but reliable blue chips certainly have a place considering their record of positive long-term returns."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Countries with the Lowest Income Tax Rates in the World.', 'The revenue model of the government is based on the tax system. The structure of a country’s tax code is a major player that determines its economic performance. The collection of taxes and fees is an underlying responsibility of the government to generate public revenues that help in financing infrastructure, human capital, and services for citizens and businesses. Individuals whose income falls under the tax brackets have to pay income taxes to the state. Countries with poor tax systems can disrupt their domestic economy and impact economic decision-making. Many countries have recognized the significance of tax systems and have reformed their tax codes.\xa0', 'Over the past decades, marginal tax rates on individual and corporate incomes have dropped significantly across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. The United States continues to reduce its personal income tax rates and corporate income tax rates. In 2024, 34 US states will go through significant tax changes. 16 states with income tax cuts in 2024 have previously been covered. Other countries such as France have reduced their corporate income tax rates by several percentage points, as per the Tax Foundation. Portugal has made improvements to its corporate tax base, while Belgium has made its corporate tax base less competitive. Chile, the US, and the UK are phasing out temporary improvements to their corporate tax bases.\xa0', 'The global economies have gone through a massive shift following the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation, high interest rates, and fiscal pressures have impacted the earnings of individuals globally. This has affected the tax collection for countries. For instance, the total revenue of the US government increased from $4.19 trillion in 2015 to $4.44 trillion in 2023. This is a slight increase and if we consider the revenue increase against inflation, the total revenue has decreased over the last seven years.\xa0', 'A competitive tax code is important for a thriving economy and a competitive tax code helps in keeping the marginal tax rates low. In today’s globalized world, individuals and corporations opt for places where the rate of return is highest and they have to pay the least taxes. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are considered some of the top places for investment with the lowest income taxes. If a country’s tax rate is too high, it will repel investment elsewhere which could lead to slower economic growth.\xa0', 'According to the Tax Foundation’s International Tax Competitiveness Index, Estonia attained the top spot in 2023 among the OECD countries for having the best tax code for a straight tenth year. The ranking of the International Tax Competitiveness Index is based on several other taxes including property taxes and cross-border taxes, in addition to personal and corporate income taxes. Estonia is also one of the safest low tax countries to live in for the US citizens. Latvia has the second most competitive tax system and follows an Estonian system for corporate taxation. New Zealand, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and Turkey, are the next best countries with the most competitive tax systems, having a competitive tax score of 88.5, 86.1, 84.7, 81.2, 78.9, and 78.6, respectively.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.

In addition to this, Stryker has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder?

Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) could hardly be more diverse, but they all have the potential to deliver excellent returns for investors this year and for the next decade. Whirlpool's 6.1% dividend yield will catch the eye of investors looking to play the housing market recovery. Devon Energy's annualized 6.7% yield is similarly eye-catching, and the stock will suit energy investors. Meanwhile, PTC will appeal to investors looking to play the exciting long-term theme of the manufacturing sector digitizing. Here's why all three are highly attractive stocks."", ""There's no doubt Whirlpool's sales growth is under pressure. It's not just that rising interest rates crimp discretionary spending; it matters more how long they stay high. In Whirlpool's case, there's evidence its end markets are slowing. For example, in the third quarter of 2023, the company was forced to pull forward its return to the kind of promotional activity it undertook before the pandemic a couple of quarters earlier than expected."", 'These pressures will likely continue into 2024, so beware the near-term risk.', ""That said, there's nothing in its end markets that lower interest rates later in the year won't help, and lower interest rates are expected. In addition, management is cutting costs significantly, and the plan to combine its European business with appliance company Arçelik, creating a new entity in which Whirlpool will own a 25% stake, makes perfect sense. It also will allow Whirlpool to focus on its core North American market."", 'The reality is that Whirlpool has found it extremely tough to make money in Europe, but its North American business is fine.

Simply put, management will be freer to focus on improving North American margins to prepandemic levels.', 'Segment', '2019 EBIT Margin', '2019 EBIT', 'First 9 Months of 2023 EBIT Margin', 'First 9 Months of 2023 EBIT', 'North America', '13.3%', '$410 million', '10.1%', '$862 million', 'Europe, Middle East, and Africa', '0.9%', '$11 million', '0.9%', '$23 million', 'Latin America', '5.3%', '$42 million', '6.0%', '$146 million', 'Asia', '0.6%', '$2 million', '3.2%', '$25 million', 'Data source: Whirlpool.

There's no getting around the fact that Devon's earnings and cash flow, and ultimately its dividend payout, depend on movements in the price of oil and gas. (Devon pays a base dividend of $0.20 a quarter and a variable dividend that depends on its cash-flow generation and capital allocation priorities.)"", ""Although Devon's stock fell slightly more than 26% in 2023, there are a few good reasons to believe it could recover in 2024. First, as I have previously said, a big reason for the decline in earnings, cash flow, and, ultimately, dividends in 2023 came down to the dramatic slump in the price of gas. However, it's now stabilized, and the price of oil is still above $70 a barrel. Extrapolating from management's projection on the company's last earnings call, in early November, oil at $70 a barrel could result in a dividend yield of roughly 5% overall based on the current price."", ""Second, lower interest rates in 2024 (if they come) will make high-yield stocks more attractive, which means more interest in stocks like Devon Energy. Third, it's important to note the price of oil is currently above $70, yet the global economy is already slowing down. This suggests that the efforts of certain oil-producing countries to support the price by restricting supply are working."", ""While there's no guarantee the price of oil will stay at these levels, Devon's base dividend ($0.20 a quarter) is protected down to a price of $40 a barrel and that indicates a yield of around 2% at the current stock price. That's not bad."", ""This industrial software company's solutions lie at the heart of the digitization of the manufacturing sector. Its computer-aided design (CAD) software helps customers digitally create and modify designs. The products that are designed can be digitally analyzed and tested via simulation before they are built. This interface between the physical and digital worlds continues with PTC's product lifecycle management (PLM) software. Meanwhile, its Internet of Things (IoT) software digitally integrates products and assets."", 'Digital technology is revolutionizing manufacturing and helping reduce product development times while creating so-called ""closed loop"" manufacturing, whereby data is being constantly analyzed to improve production iteratively, and can even lead to adjustments to the product design.', ""These are hot concepts in modern manufacturing plants, and PTC is a leader in the field. The company continues to grow its annual run rate revenue, a figure that represents its recurring revenue, at a mid-teens growth rate, and it's likely to drop down into significantly more free-cash-flow generation in the coming years. Wall Street analysts have PTC growing its free cash flow to around $1 billion in 2026, putting the stock at a ratio of 20 times estimated 2026 free cash flow at the current price.

It would be best if you looked at the company's prospects in 2024 to answer that question. Here's the lowdown on what investors might expect from the company this year."", ""It will be a year of execution and change for GE. The change comes from the planned spinoff of GE Vernova (encompassing GE Power and GE Renewable Energy) in the second quarter. The execution bit comes from management's opportunity to deliver on its backlogs at GE Aerospace (which will be the remaining company as the General Electric name disappears) and improve profitability at both GE Vernova businesses."", ""If you buy GE stock now, you will get exposure to both companies after the spinoff takes place, and the good news is there's ample room for improvement in both companies in 2024."", 'GE Aerospace has excellent earnings and orders momentum, with a multiyear backlog in place, and its defense business is improving, too.', 'GE Vernova has a management with a track record of executing a game plan at GE Power that is being applied across GE Renewable Energy.', ""The aerospace recovery will naturally slow in 2024 from the torrid rates of growth achieved over the last couple of years. Management hasn't given specific guidance for GE Aerospace in 2024 yet. Still, we know the business will likely easily exceed the full-year 2023 guidance given at last March's investor day presentation."", 'Back then, management forecast a profit of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. However, a stronger-than-expected recovery led management to upgrade this estimate to $6 billion in October.', ""We also know that management's guidance (March 2023) called for $7.6 billion to $8 billion in 2025. As such, investors will expect guidance for 2024 that can act as a bridge to hitting the 2025 targets."", ""There's reason to believe it can hit these figures because 2024 will mark the year when GE sees a massive jump in internal shop visits on its LEAP engines (the sole engine option on the Boeing 737 MAX and one of two options on the Airbus A320 neo). In addition, GE Aerospace's orders remain in robust growth mode (up 28% in the first nine months on a year-over-year basis)."", 'Moreover, it was an excellent year for LEAP engine orders, with 1,455 orders in the first nine months alone -- a figure comparable with the full-year 1,515 and 1,457 achieved in the full-year figures in 2021 and 2022.', ""Finally, GE Aerospace's spare rate continues to grow exceptionally as shop visits align with flight departures."", ""In a nutshell, the industrial company's management wants to repeat the game plan that worked at GE Power with GE Renewable Energy. GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik was responsible for turning around GE Power."", 'This chart demonstrates the fundamental dynamics whereby GE Power worked through less profitable legacy contracts, deployed lean manufacturing techniques to improve margins, and improved the margin profile in its order book. The latter requires a more disciplined approach to pricing when competing for contracts.', 'Note how sales declined from 2018 to 2022, yet margin improvement meant profit improved dramatically.', ""Management wants to take a similar approach to the loss-making GE Renewable Energy business, and it's already making good progress with its grid and onshore businesses -- both profitable in the third quarter, with a dramatically improved margin profile in the onshore wind backlog."", 'That\'s why it was intriguing to hear GE CEO Larry Culp announced that Onshore Wind CEO Vic Abate\'s role would expand to cover offshore, with Culp noting, ""We\'re taking a similarly disciplined approach to writing new business like we\'ve done over at Gas, Onshore, and Grid, with increased rigor on pricing, terms, geographic exposure, and other risks.""', 'With Strazik overseeing GE Vernova and Abate charged with turning around offshore wind, the company has key executives in place to engineer improvement in the renewable energy business.', ""GE Aerospace has great momentum, and while GE Vernova likely lost money in 2023, GE Power is solidly profitable. The real problem area at GE Renewable Energy is its offshore wind business (a relatively new business for GE that it's scaling up for growth). If Strazik and Abate can repeat the GE Power and onshore wind and grid game plan, GE Vernova could significantly improve in 2024. As such, GE remains an attractive stock for investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and General Electric wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the restoration and remediation sector, you can go directly to the Best Water Damage Restoration Services in Each of 5 Biggest Cities in the US.', ""The restoration and remediation sector has witnessed significant growth in the recent past. In 2020, the global restoration sector was valued at around $210 billion. The water damage restoration sector is now projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8% from 2020 to 2025. Water damage restoration services take up the largest market share of the industry at 41%. The rise in demand for water restoration services in the United States is mainly due to the risks related to various climates and the occurrence of natural disasters across multiple regions. For example, the Midwest experiences a significant number of tornadoes, primarily during April, May, and June. Similarly, floods represent a frequent natural occurrence in the US, especially when tropical storms and hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast. However, flooding isn't confined solely to the Gulf Coast. Approximately 10% of the total land area in the United States has been classified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as high risk for flooding. This classification affects around 13 million people across the country."", 'Floods prove to be a costly challenge as they significantly impact the insurance sector, leading to high property damage payouts. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has paid out over $50 billion in claims in the last 20 years. Over 75% of flood insurance payouts have been made to just five states: New York, Texas, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Florida. Louisiana, in particular, has faced the highest flood claims, totaling $22.1 billion, mainly due to Hurricane Katrina.\xa0 The biggest flood claims in the NFIP have been from hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, and Superstorm Sandy. Such disasters often leave popular home insurers like Aon plc (NYSE:AON), The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR),\xa0and Erie Indemnity Company (NASDAQ:ERIE)\xa0with above-average payouts in the hurricane and flooding belt regions.

The period started poorly for Progressive as shares were down 13% on July 13. The company reported weak prior-year development in its first-half results as well as high costs for catastrophes. Claims inflation has been an industry problem, and investors feared Progressive would be unable to offset rising claims inflation through pricing, which could hurt policy growth. We added aggressively to our position on weakness given our confidence in Progressive’s low-cost model and excellent underwriting. Claims inflation is not a Progressive-specific issue, and we felt it would be able to pass on the costs and still retain its competitive advantage given its low-cost model. The company recently reported results that showed the business is recovering margin and still growing policies. The share price has more than recovered the July losses.”', ""The damages and claims resulting from major natural events are only part of the picture, as routine events like pipeline bursts, water seepage from leaking pipes and drains, wastewater backflows, and various other incidents can cause significant harm to both residential and commercial buildings. Regardless of the cause of water damage, there is a universal acknowledgment that time is of the essence in its management. Some forms of damage can become irreparable within as little as 24 to 48 hours. Hence, selecting the best water damage restoration services near one's residence is critical. It is important to ensure that these companies have a proven track record in water damage restoration and employ restoration water damage\xa0experts who hold licenses from the Institute of Inspection, Cleaning, and Restoration Certification (IICRC).

These products stimulate a hormone to reduce users' appetite, encouraging weight loss."", ""Intended to treat Type II diabetes, Ozempic went viral for its weight loss properties, including heavy usage among celebrities that garnished tons of media coverage. The company's Wegovy drug is very similar but is approved to treat chronic weight management. The prevalence of obesity gives Novo Nordisk a tremendous runway for growth, even with competitors like Eli Lilly releasing their own GLP-1 RA products."", ""Analysts believe Novo Nordisk can compound earnings at nearly 18% annually on average over the long term. At that rate, the earnings would double in just over three years. The stock's valuation also isn't too expensive today. A forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 32 means that it could take some time for the business to catch up to the stock, but there's enough growth here that investors should feel confident that five-year investment returns will be rewarding."", ""Telehealth caught on during the COVID-19 pandemic when patients could not travel to their doctors' offices. That trend has stuck around, which helped put Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) into its strong position today. Patients can receive virtual consultations for a variety of health conditions, ranging from mental health to sexual health, and if prescribed, purchase and have pharmaceuticals delivered to their homes."", ""The company's outstanding growth demonstrates how much Hims & Hers' branding and products have resonated with patients. Its member count has grown from 554,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 1.4 million as of the third quarter of 2023. Revenue has soared, and the business turned cash-flow positive in 2023 despite spending roughly half its revenue on marketing to drive that growth. Gross profit margins are over 80%."", 'The business is preparing to turn a bottom-line profit, which CEO Andrew Dudum believes could come as soon as Q4 of 2023. This puts the stock in a great position to impress Wall Street in a market seemingly emphasizing profits since interest rates began rising in 2022. Given that revenue growth could end 2023 at 64% year over year, earnings growth should fly once profits turn positive. Still trading at a price-to-sales ratio under two, the stock seems due for an upward rerating.', ""You can't invest in U.S. healthcare without bringing up UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). It's one of the largest health insurance companies in America and provides various services and technology throughout the broader healthcare system. In all, it does a staggering $371 billion in annual revenue. It's also one of the best-performing stocks you'll find. Shares have returned a total of 438,000% over their lifetime."", ""There isn't much of a secret sauce to this recipe. UnitedHealth's dominance in the U.S. healthcare industry means it's grown with broader healthcare for decades. It boosts earnings growth by using profits to repurchase shares and puts money in shareholders' pockets with a dividend that management has increased for 14 consecutive years."", ""Any diversified portfolio should consider holding UnitedHealth. Today, the company has a whopping $485 billion market cap, which can make growth harder to come by. Still, analysts believe earnings can compound at over 11% over the long term. The stock's forward P/E is 18, making its 1.6 price/earnings-to-growth ratio a reasonable price tag for its expected growth. Buy and hold, and investors should double their money within a decade if UnitedHealth continues doing what it's been for a long time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Novo Nordisk wasn't one of them.

However, no healthcare company has reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Perhaps that's not so surprising. After all, very few companies are part of this elite club."", ""But it's only a matter of time until one healthcare stock finally hits that goal, so which one will do it first? My money is on Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). Let's find out why."", ""Let's start with a list of some healthcare companies that have a chance at joining the trillion-dollar club within, say, a decade. These are the largest ones in the world. Eli Lilly sits on top, with a market cap of about $610 billion. Next comes insurance specialist UnitedHealth Group, valued at roughly $482 billion -- or over $100 billion less than Eli Lilly. Rounding up the top three is another leading drugmaker based in Denmark, Novo Nordisk, with a market cap of $470 billion. Johnson & Johnson ranks fourth with a business worth $390 billion, while Merck completes the top five at $300 billion."", ""Of course, there is always the possibility a much smaller healthcare company will overtake all of these and land at a valuation of $1 trillion first. Still, given that Eli Lilly is currently the largest, all it has to do is perform at least as well as all the ones within striking distance while hoping none outside this small group somehow skyrocket to the top. Let's put that second possibility aside for now."", ""Can any of Eli Lilly's direct competitors perform much better than it will before it reaches $1 trillion? Starting with Merck, the company's main growth driver for a long time has been its cancer drug Keytruda. While it will continue performing well for a bit longer, Keytruda is set to face a patent cliff by 2028. Merck is working to resolve this problem, but until the company's post-Keytruda plans are much clearer, the market is unlikely to reward the stock by bidding it up significantly."", ""Johnson & Johnson is another great company, especially for dividend investors. However, the drugmaker's legal problems should continue weighing on the stock. That doesn't mean it isn't worth holding shares of Johnson & Johnson, but the upside is somewhat limited compared to what it would have to do to overtake Eli Lilly. That leaves three stocks in the running."", ""Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have a lot in common. They operate in the same industry and are the two leaders in the markets for diabetes and obesity drugs. However, the former has an edge over its longtime foe. Eli Lilly's newest medicine for diabetes/obesity, Mounjaro (marketed as Zepbound in helping to manage weight), seems to be more effective than Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and is projected to become perhaps the best-selling therapy in the history of the industry."", ""Furthermore, Eli Lilly has a much more diversified source of revenue. Novo Nordisk relies almost entirely on its diabetes and obesity work, which is not the case for its competitor. Eli Lilly still has several important therapies in other areas in the pipeline. It is currently awaiting approval for the Alzheimer's disease treatment donanemab, which is almost destined to become a blockbuster."", ""In short, it will be difficult for Novo Nordisk to outperform Eli Lilly in terms of financial results and stock market performances from here on out. That leaves just one company in the running: UnitedHealth Group. It is harder to compare these two behemoths that operate entirely different businesses. UnitedHealth is an excellent stock in its own right. However, once again, Eli Lilly starts with an edge of more than $100 billion in market value, which isn't easy to overcome."", ""Furthermore, while analysts see UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share (EPS) growing at an average of 11.6% for the next five years, Eli Lilly's estimated EPS growth in the next half a decade is more than twice that at 28.7%. At its current valuation, Eli Lilly needs to register a compound annual growth rate of 10.4% to become a trillion-dollar company in five years. In my view, that's well within the company's powers. And once it accomplishes that goal, the drugmaker won't stop."", 'The bottom line: Eli Lilly is an excellent stock to buy and hold today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

This is a big reason behind the popularity of “dividend aristocrat” stocks, or stocks with a more than 25 year track record of dividend growth.', 'Yet while some of the highest-quality dividend stocks out there have “dividend aristocrat,” or, in some cases, “dividend king” (50 years or more of consecutive dividend growth) status, names in either category aren’t the only long-term dividend names to consider.', 'There are also plenty of “aristocrats” in the making, stocks that have ten years or more of dividend growth under their belts. In some cases, these rising-star dividend stocks may be stronger opportunities, in terms of yield and price appreciation.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With this, let’s take a look at seven long-term dividend stocks, of either the “aristocrat” or “aspiring aristocrat” variety, and see why each one is worthy of making a buy-and-hold position at current prices.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is global leader in the payroll processing industry. With its deep economic moat, the company has a strong track record of steady growth and consistent earnings, resulting in strong total returns (price appreciation and dividends) for investors.', 'As I have argued previously, this makes ADP stock a top choice among stocks to buy and hold for years, decades, or even over several generations. While arguably trading at a fair valuation (25.9 times forward earnings), given the aforementioned qualities, and assuming high single-digit earnings growth continues, this valuation is likely sustainable.', 'At current prices, ADP sports a forward yield of 2.37%. This may not sound like “high yield” to you, but with the company just a year away from reaching “dividend king” status, and the latest dividend increase coming in at 12%, these payouts are likely to continue being a significant contributor to total returns.', 'Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com', 'American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a water utility company, serving 3.4 million customers across fourteen U.S. states. With fifteen years of consecutive dividend growth, this stock is a decade away from reaching “aristocrat” status.', 'Again though, “aspiring aristocrats” like AWK stock should also be considered top choices among long-term dividend stocks. Trading for 27.4 times forward earnings, it’s not as if shares have been under-the-radar of the market. Like with ADP, AWK’s is fairly valued rather than undervalued.', 'However, with AWK representing ownership in a high-margin, recession resistant business. With sell-side forecasts calling for high-single digit earnings growth in the coming years, this valuation is likely sustainable. Shares in turn could keep moving higher, in tandem with this earnings growth. AWK has a 2.14% annual dividend yield. Payouts have grown by an average of 9.31% per year over the past five years.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is another “aspiring aristocrat” I’ve included in past coverage of top stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. As it relates to long-term capital growth, there are two strong catalysts in motion. First, geopolitical tensions are rising and aren’t likely to simmer down anytime soon.', 'This bodes well for defense stocks across the board, and LHX stock is no exception. Second, there is great potential for cost/growth synergies, as a result of L3Harris’ penchant for making “bolt-on” acquisitions of other defense contracting companies.', 'Regarding dividend growth, LHX has increased payouts 22 years in a row, hence the “aspiring aristocrat” moniker for this 2.19%-yielding stock. While the company’s last dividend increase was small (1.79%), a re-acceleration of earnings growth due to the above-mentioned catalysts could mean a return to larger dividend increases seen in the recent past.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Shares in NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) struggled during most of 2023, but make no mistake. NEE remains one of the top long-term dividend stocks, and could produce strong total returns for investors buying it today.', 'NEE stock slumped because of rising interest rates and their impact on growth, but has started to bounce back due to growing expectations about interest rate cuts later this year. Trading for 18 times estimated 2024 earnings, shares appear more than reasonably priced, given mid-to-high single digit growth forecasts. A further renewal of appreciation for NEE’s long-term potential could mean a continued re-rating to the upside.', 'Speaking of earnings growth, don’t forget such growth also points to further increases in this “aristocrat’s” quarterly payouts. The stock today has a forward annual yield of 3.06%. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy has increased its dividend payout by an average of 11% annually.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', '“Dividend aristocrat” McDonalds (NYSE:MCD) may be considered the top restaurant stock among long-term dividend investors, but instead of opting for the golden arches, you may want to select Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) instead.', 'The ubiquitous coffee chain still has a ways to go before becoming an “aristocrat” itself.', 'However, between now and when SBUX stock attains this status, shares could produce very strong returns. Shares currently have an annual dividend yield of 2.48%. This payout has grown by double-digits on average each year over the past five years.', 'More importantly, atop this baseline return, is the likely continued price appreciation, driven by earnings growth. Forecasts call for Starbucks’ earnings to increase by 15.5% this fiscal year (ending September 2024), and by between 16% and 17% during the following two fiscal years after that. Not too shabby, for a stock trading for just 22.3 times forward earnings.', 'Source: RMC42/ShutterStock.com', 'When it comes to long-term dividend stocks, Snap-On (NYSE:SNA) is another name to consider. The industrial tool maker’s dividend (current forward yield of 2.62%) has increased by 14.5% on average annually over the past five years.', 'Admittedly, this level of dividend growth may not seem sustainable. After all, forecasts call for mixed results in the coming years. So then, why make SNA stock a “set and forget” long-term buy? While encountering a rough patch today, over a longer time frame Snap-On has demonstrated consistent profitability growth.', 'Furthermore, Snap-On beat expectations when it last reported earnings. Future results could come in much stronger than sell-side estimates suggest. Reasonably-priced at 15.2 times forward earnings, there may even be room for an expansion of SNA’s forward multiple. Growth re-acceleration, success with a recent acquisition, or even greater investor awareness may result in an eventual re-rating for Snap-On shares.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'With a forward dividend yield of 0.79%, Visa (NYSE:V) at first may not seem like a noteworthy dividend stock. Yet while the company, one of the world’s leading payment technology firms, sports a low yield, said yield has been growing at a rapid clip.', 'That is, payouts for V stock have grown by around 16.3% on average annually over the past five years. Such payout growth may be poised to continue. As I argued previously, numerous factors point to the company continuing to report double-digit earnings growth in the years to come.', 'The largest factor is the global pivot away from using cash to using cards/digital payment options for consumer transactions. This long-term trend is of course also a good sign when it comes to further price appreciation. This should outweigh any near-term concerns about the stock’s valuation (26.7 times forward earnings) and low yield.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

(TSMC). The surge in semiconductor stocks contributed to the upward momentum of MSCI Inc.'s Asia Pacific index for the second consecutive day. TSMC, in particular, experienced a remarkable increase of over 6% in Taiwan, while its American depository receipts saw an impressive surge of nearly 10%, reaching the highest closing level since February 2022. The noteworthy performance of TSMC has become a focal point, acting as a catalyst for heightened expectations of a global recovery within the semiconductor sector. The positive momentum in Asia reflects the broader sentiment in equity markets, driven by the resilience and growth potential perceived in key industry players. Traders' sentiments are undergoing shifts, with a notable reduction in bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated in March. This adjustment in expectations aligns with the evolving economic landscape and signals a degree of confidence in the prevailing economic conditions. Redmond Wong, Chief China Strategist, provided insights into the outlook for the world's second-largest economy, shedding light on government policies and their implications for the stock markets. These discussions underscore the importance of staying informed about global economic dynamics and geopolitical factors that influence market trends. As markets continue to respond to changing conditions, the performance of semiconductor stocks, such as TSMC, serves as a barometer for broader economic recovery sentiments. Investors and analysts will closely monitor developments in the semiconductor sector and gauge their impact on global markets in the coming days."", ""According to Reuters, the most recent economic indicators point towards a positive trajectory for the U.S. economy as of January 18, with notable developments in jobless claims and the housing market. Weekly jobless claims have reached a 16-month low, falling by 16,000 to 187,000, showcasing a robust labor market. The decline, unexpected by economists, hints at sustained job growth in January and contributes to an optimistic economic outlook, potentially complicating expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March. The strong performance is attributed to the resilience of the labor market, where companies are demonstrating reluctance to lay off workers amidst challenges in finding skilled labor, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Though some volatility in claims data is expected during the turn of the year, the overall trend aligns with a tight labor market. In the housing sector, single-family housing starts experienced an 8.6% decline in December, attributed in part to adverse weather conditions. However, the year-on-year increase of 15.8% indicates sustained demand, fueled by a shortage of existing homes for sale. Building permits for single-family homes rose by 1.7% to the highest level since May 2022, reflecting positive sentiment among homebuilders and responding to declining mortgage rates. While the housing market shows signs of resilience and increased demand for new construction, challenges persist, particularly in addressing the inventory shortage. The gap between housing starts and completion rates and the inventory gap in the market underscore the need for additional supply to alleviate the housing affordability crisis. Overall, these economic indicators provide a multifaceted view of the U.S. economy's current state, with both the labor market and the housing sector contributing to a generally positive narrative.

In 2022, stable, dividend-paying companies were a beacon of safety amid a widespread downturn in the major indexes. Last year, mega-cap growth stocks, especially big tech, led to market exuberance and an outperforming year for the Nasdaq Composite.', ""It's too early to tell what 2024 will bring. But Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Target (NYSE: TGT) all lost value last year despite the S&P 500's gain of 24%. However, all three companies are Dividend Kings, having paid and raised their dividends for over 50 consecutive years."", ""Investors looking for safe, out-of-favor stocks have come to the right place. Here's why each stock is worth buying no matter what happens in the broader market."", ""On Jan. 11, Coca-Cola announced that it will be reporting fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings on Feb. 13. There's no word yet on a dividend increase. But history shows that Coke tends to raise its dividend in February. Investors should expect the quarterly dividend to rise to at least $0.48 per share, which would mark the company's 62nd year of consecutive dividend increases."", 'The dividend is a big reason to own Coke stock. Even without assuming a dividend raise, Coke yields 3.1%, which is higher than the average stock in the S&P 500. Using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust as a benchmark, the S&P 500 yields just 1.4%.', ""Coke has a resilient business model that can perform well regardless of the market cycle. But this advantage can also be a disadvantage, as Coke doesn't have a lot of upside even if the economy is thriving."", 'To achieve steady growth over time, Coke has to grow case volumes (sales), justify price increases, and operate a portfolio of successful brands while also adding brands to the mix to retain market share and diversify into new beverage categories. Overall, Coke has executed this strategy very well.', ""In the chart, you can see that Coke's revenue is just now returning to levels seen a decade ago. The difference today is that Coke has far higher operating margins, so it's making much more operating income per dollar of sales."", 'Part of Coke\'s future success will depend on an effective marketing campaign. The company\'s ""Raising the Bar: Marketing & Innovation"" presentation in third-quarter 2023 gave investors details of what to expect from Coke in the years to come. Coke recognizes that people have changing preferences. To maintain its market share, it has to grow its non-soda portfolio while not overspending on marketing and advertising at the expense of margins.', ""Overall, Coke seems to have a good handle on what it needs to do to keep delivering shareholder returns over time. The brand is strong, the portfolio is diverse, the dividend is solid, and the valuation isn't terrible, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.5."", 'Overall, Coke is a reliable passive income source and a worthy addition to any portfolio.', ""Procter & Gamble is very similar to Coke because it is a Dividend King that can perform well in a weak economy. And although Coke is considered a consumer staple company, soda, tea, coffee, and energy drinks aren't necessities in the same way as household essentials like toothpaste, detergent, toilet paper, and diapers are."", 'I like Coke, but I love P&G. The simple reason is that P&G is truly diversified. Whereas Coke covers different parts of the beverage category, P&G sells many different household staples, including beauty and grooming, healthcare, baby, feminine, and family care products, and fabric and home care.', ""For example, in a category like toilet paper, P&G may be competing with other brands, but it's still a basic item people will buy no matter what. The same can't be said for the beverage industry, where folks aren't simply selecting different options within, say, the soda category, but are deciding between soda and another beverage altogether, as well as whether to consume a beverage out and about or at home."", ""Some may counter by saying there's limited pricing power for Tide detergent over a non-P&G competitor like Arm & Hammer (owned by Church & Dwight). But P&G's pricing power has been in full effect this past year. Despite stagnant or even lower sales volume, P&G was still able to grow sales thanks to sizable price increases."", ""Brands matter, even for consumer staples, and P&G has proven that time and time again. At 2.5%, the yield isn't as high as Coke's. But P&G also has a better track record of buybacks than Coke, as it tends to spend about the same on buybacks as it does on the dividend."", ""To top it all off, P&G has a solid free cash flow yield of 3.9%, coincidentally the same as Coke. That means that if both companies used all their free cash flow to pay dividends, the dividend yield would be 3.9%. Basically, these are cash cow businesses that directly reward shareholders in a variety of ways. P&G severely underperformed the market last year, and I don't expect that to happen again in 2024."", ""Target carries Coke and P&G products at its stores. But it also sells several higher-margin discretionary products. Target's product mix makes it more vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of the economic cycle."", 'The retailer was hit hard by weak consumer spending, a shift in mix away from discretionary toward staples, and supply chain and inventory bottlenecks that took years to resolve. Despite rebounding (big time) from a three-year low in October, Target is still down 47% from its all-time high.', 'One of the reasons Target has recovered so much in recent months -- aside from a rebound in the overall market -- is that it finally showed signs of improvement, namely in rising margins and lower inventory.', ""The company isn't out of the woods yet. But lower interest rates in 2024 should help drive higher consumer spending and economic growth, which could do wonders for Target's margins."", 'Target should have never sold off as much as it did. The company is prone to cycles, but its long-term future is bright. Target has invested heavily in improving the store experience, e-commerce, curbside pickup, and its Target Circle rewards program. The moves have boosted customer loyalty and should help drive a stickier customer base and make the company more resilient to economic cycles.', ""Target is a Dividend King, which is a testament to its brand power and financial strength, which has allowed it to raise its payout even during challenging times. What's more, Target stock has a fairly high yield of 3.1%, the same as Coke. But Target has far more growth potential."", 'Add it all up, and Target is arguably the best Dividend King on this list for folks who can stomach a little more volatility.', ""Coke, P&G, and Target aren't companies that can outperform during a growth-led bull market. After all, it's easy to ignore a 3% dividend when the market is up double digits in a single year."", ""But the true value of these companies isn't in their performance relative to the market, but in their ability to provide investors with an income stream, no matter what the market is doing."", 'Folks looking for reliable investments to add to their portfolio should consider all three stocks now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Data collected across the 50 largest metropolitan cities suggested that cities with houses valued higher than the national average had the highest rate of homeless people. Meanwhile, cities with houses valued below the average value had 2.5 times fewer homeless people. The lack of affordable housing directly increases the demand for housing, giving landlords and corporations opportunities to raise rents and exploit low-income families.', ""Low-income families and workers face the most difficulty in finding affordable housing. The National Low Income Housing Coalition reported that a full-time worker must earn $21.25 per hour to be able to afford single-room housing in the US.\xa0 This is termed the 'housing wage' required if a person wants to spend less than 30% of their total income on housing costs. The high cost of living coupled with out-of-reach rents have made it impossible for an average low-income family to survive, resulting in an alarmingly high number ending up homeless."", 'Dr. Ken Chilton of Tennesse State University published a study on the impact of REITs on the housing market. It highlights how REITs in the US are rapidly replacing landlords by taking over low-income housing areas.

As with e-commerce, Amazon is also developing its own lower-cost ""private label"" products and services, with its Graviton, Inferentia, and Trainium in-house-designed semiconductors, and even its own in-house large language model, called Titan.', ""Basically, I don't believe Amazon has lost any of its competitive fervor or ability to innovate in the age of AI. At a relatively low valuation relative to history, it's a great buy to start the new year."", ""The economy has proved more resilient than many expected, and it's shown up in the results of credit card issuer and card network American Express (NYSE: AXP). The curious thing about American Express stock is that it garners a majority of its business from payment volumes and card fees, which are not dependent on underwriting loans. Yet at 16.9 times trailing earnings, the stock trades more like other large banks, and not card network rivals Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which trade at 32 and 37 times earnings, respectively."", ""But only 22% of American Express' revenues come from net interest income on loans and card receivables. Therefore, one might think AmEx would trade at a higher multiple than it does. This is especially true as the company's lending book has also shown very strong results."", ""Last quarter, American Express' net write-off rate remained at 1.8%, consistent with the prior quarter and still below the 2.2% write-off rate of the fourth quarter 2019 before the pandemic, when interest rates were much lower. Meanwhile, the company's payments volume continues to grow faster than GDP at 7%, thanks to inflation-protected spending and increasing card use. And AmEx has showcased its pricing power too, with card fees up 20% year-over-year-last quarter."", 'American Express has done a great job of pivoting its classic premium brand to suit the needs of millennial and Gen Z customers, with over 60% of new accounts coming from these demographics. That has come from understanding what perks these age cohorts want, and delivering it. As further evidence, J.D. Power just selected American Express as the No. 1 credit card company for the fourth year in a row.', ""In the second quarter of 2023, Buffett or his lieutenants made a big bet on three different U.S. homebuilders, but the vast majority of the investment went to just one of those names: D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI). That may be because D.R. Horton is the largest homebuilder in the country and Buffett needs to buy large stocks to make a dent in Berkshire's portfolio. But there's also a compelling case for D.R. Horton specifically in today's industry climate."", 'First on the investing thesis behind homebuilders generally. One, these stocks tend to trade at low multiples. Even after rising over 70% in 2023, D.R. Horton only trades at 11.2 times earnings today.', 'Homebuilders have tended to trade at low valuations, because of their perceived cyclicality and sensitivity to interest rates, as well as their traditional capital intensity with having to buy land up front. But Buffett seems to be making a bet that those multiples will rise.', 'There are a few good reasons for this. First, the homebuilding industry has become more concentrated, with the top 10 builders making up about 50% of all new homes built today. Moreover, top builders are using options to buy land these days, rather than outright purchases, decreasing the need for up-front capital investment and allowing for greater returns on equity.', ""And conditions may be especially favorable for homebuilders today within the housing market. There has been an undersupply of new homes built over the past 10 years, putting a floor under prices. Meanwhile, since mortgage rates have gone up so much from the pandemic and pre-pandemic low-rate era, homeowners with existing fixed rates aren't moving very much. The lack of existing homes for sale are tightening the market even further, leaving more and more of available supply coming from newly built homes."", ""That leaves conditions very favorable for homebuilders, provided, of course, buyers can still afford homes. Many buyers, especially first-timers, have been priced out of markets. But that's also why D.R. Horton specifically may find itself in a favorable position, with its focus on affordable and quick move-in homes, with more than half its customers in the form of first-time buyers. And because of Horton's scale, it can probably out-price smaller homebuilders with perks such as mortgage rate buy-downs."", ""That's why D.R. Horton has posted a string of earning beats over the past year, increased its dividend by 20% last quarter, and upped guidance for share repurchases in the upcoming year. Expect more good things from this new Buffett stock in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

As is almost always the case, there have been some market overreactions to the latest numbers, sending some great stocks downward and presenting buying opportunities for investors willing to be patient. Overall, the outlook for this earnings season is pessimistic but there are some undervalued blue-chip stocks to consider.', 'According to the latest data, analysts on Wall Street expect Q4 earnings growth of 1.30% for companies listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index. For comparison, in last year’s third-quarter, S&P 500 companies recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 13.9%, one of the strongest quarters in several years. Despite the glum outlook, there is always room for surprise, and there continue to be bargains available in this market. Here are the three most undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy in January.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) had one of the better Q4 prints among the banks. However, its stock dropped 3% immediately after its financials were released because management warned that the lender’s net interest income for 2024 could come in lower than expected.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Wells Fargo reported Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of 86 cents, which matched Wall Street forecasts. Revenue totaled $20.49 billion, which was ahead of the $20.30 billion that analysts expected.', 'Wells Fargo’s results would have been better had it not been for $1.28 billion set aside for credit losses. Unfortunately, analysts and investors chose to focus on net interest income in the quarter, which was $12.77 billion—a bit better than the expected $12.76 billion but down 5% from a year ago. That, combined with the muted forecast, pulled WFC stock down. But with a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 10 and a quarterly dividend that yields nearly 3%, Wells Fargo looks attractive at current levels.', 'In the last 12 months, WFC stock has risen 7%, performing better than many of its peers in the banking sector.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Many analysts are talking about a rebound in healthcare stocks in 2024. If that’s the case, investors should load up on shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and buy the dip after the company’s Q4 results. The largest healthcare insurer in the U.S. reported Q4 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. But, like Wells Fargo, UNH stock dropped 3% due to higher-than-expected utilization rate for medical services.', 'For the final quarter of 2023, UnitedHealth reported EPS of $6.16 and revenue of $94.4 billion. That topped consensus forecasts that called for earnings of $5.98 a share and revenue of $92.1 billion. Sadly, Wall Street didn’t like that UnitedHealth said its medical loss ratio for Q4, which tracks the proportion of premiums paid to cover medical expenses, was 85%, above the 84% estimate. A higher medical loss ratio is of concern because it means more spending on medical expenses and less room for profits.', 'The past year has been historically weak for UNH stock, which is up 6% in the last 12 months and trailing the market. Trading at 22 times future earnings estimates is also low for the stock, and it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.88 for a yield of about 1.50%. It looks like an undervalued blue-chip stock.', 'Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com', 'Now for a massive overreaction that presents a great buying opportunity. Delta Air Lines’ (NYSE:DAL) stock plunged 9% in a single trading session after the carrier announced that its Q4 profit more than doubled from a year earlier. Not only did DAL stock plunge after the airline issued its Q4 results but so too did the stocks of other U.S. carriers, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) dropping 10% on the day and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) falling 11%.', 'Airline stocks were already undervalued before Delta’s latest print, especially with air travel in the U.S. returning to pre-pandemic levels and record bookings. But after Delta’s print, the airline stocks look like bargains. Delta reported Q4 EPS of $1.28 versus Wall Street’s forecasted $1.17. Revenue came in at $13.66 billion compared to the expected $13.52 billion. Delta reported $2.04 billion in net income, more than double $828 million a year earlier.', 'Sales in the latest quarter were up 6% from a year ago, and the airline attributed the strong results to a continued rise in travel demand, particularly for international flights. The company also said that corporate travel is finally improving after the pandemic. But Delta trimmed its outlook slightly, forecasting EPS of $6 to $7, below a previous forecast of $7, and stocks in the entire airline sector crashed. DAL stock is trading at only seven times future earnings forecasts and pays a dividend yielding 1.04%.', 'On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This is a big reason behind the popularity of “dividend aristocrat” stocks, or stocks with a more than 25 year track record of dividend growth.', 'Yet while some of the highest-quality dividend stocks out there have “dividend aristocrat,” or, in some cases, “dividend king” (50 years or more of consecutive dividend growth) status, names in either category aren’t the only long-term dividend names to consider.', 'There are also plenty of “aristocrats” in the making, stocks that have ten years or more of dividend growth under their belts. In some cases, these rising-star dividend stocks may be stronger opportunities, in terms of yield and price appreciation.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With this, let’s take a look at seven long-term dividend stocks, of either the “aristocrat” or “aspiring aristocrat” variety, and see why each one is worthy of making a buy-and-hold position at current prices.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is global leader in the payroll processing industry. With its deep economic moat, the company has a strong track record of steady growth and consistent earnings, resulting in strong total returns (price appreciation and dividends) for investors.', 'As I have argued previously, this makes ADP stock a top choice among stocks to buy and hold for years, decades, or even over several generations. While arguably trading at a fair valuation (25.9 times forward earnings), given the aforementioned qualities, and assuming high single-digit earnings growth continues, this valuation is likely sustainable.', 'At current prices, ADP sports a forward yield of 2.37%. This may not sound like “high yield” to you, but with the company just a year away from reaching “dividend king” status, and the latest dividend increase coming in at 12%, these payouts are likely to continue being a significant contributor to total returns.', 'Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com', 'American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a water utility company, serving 3.4 million customers across fourteen U.S. states. With fifteen years of consecutive dividend growth, this stock is a decade away from reaching “aristocrat” status.', 'Again though, “aspiring aristocrats” like AWK stock should also be considered top choices among long-term dividend stocks. Trading for 27.4 times forward earnings, it’s not as if shares have been under-the-radar of the market. Like with ADP, AWK’s is fairly valued rather than undervalued.', 'However, with AWK representing ownership in a high-margin, recession resistant business. With sell-side forecasts calling for high-single digit earnings growth in the coming years, this valuation is likely sustainable. Shares in turn could keep moving higher, in tandem with this earnings growth. AWK has a 2.14% annual dividend yield. Payouts have grown by an average of 9.31% per year over the past five years.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is another “aspiring aristocrat” I’ve included in past coverage of top stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. As it relates to long-term capital growth, there are two strong catalysts in motion. First, geopolitical tensions are rising and aren’t likely to simmer down anytime soon.', 'This bodes well for defense stocks across the board, and LHX stock is no exception. Second, there is great potential for cost/growth synergies, as a result of L3Harris’ penchant for making “bolt-on” acquisitions of other defense contracting companies.', 'Regarding dividend growth, LHX has increased payouts 22 years in a row, hence the “aspiring aristocrat” moniker for this 2.19%-yielding stock. While the company’s last dividend increase was small (1.79%), a re-acceleration of earnings growth due to the above-mentioned catalysts could mean a return to larger dividend increases seen in the recent past.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Shares in NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) struggled during most of 2023, but make no mistake. NEE remains one of the top long-term dividend stocks, and could produce strong total returns for investors buying it today.', 'NEE stock slumped because of rising interest rates and their impact on growth, but has started to bounce back due to growing expectations about interest rate cuts later this year. Trading for 18 times estimated 2024 earnings, shares appear more than reasonably priced, given mid-to-high single digit growth forecasts. A further renewal of appreciation for NEE’s long-term potential could mean a continued re-rating to the upside.', 'Speaking of earnings growth, don’t forget such growth also points to further increases in this “aristocrat’s” quarterly payouts. The stock today has a forward annual yield of 3.06%. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy has increased its dividend payout by an average of 11% annually.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', '“Dividend aristocrat” McDonalds (NYSE:MCD) may be considered the top restaurant stock among long-term dividend investors, but instead of opting for the golden arches, you may want to select Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) instead.', 'The ubiquitous coffee chain still has a ways to go before becoming an “aristocrat” itself.', 'However, between now and when SBUX stock attains this status, shares could produce very strong returns. Shares currently have an annual dividend yield of 2.48%. This payout has grown by double-digits on average each year over the past five years.', 'More importantly, atop this baseline return, is the likely continued price appreciation, driven by earnings growth. Forecasts call for Starbucks’ earnings to increase by 15.5% this fiscal year (ending September 2024), and by between 16% and 17% during the following two fiscal years after that. Not too shabby, for a stock trading for just 22.3 times forward earnings.', 'Source: RMC42/ShutterStock.com', 'When it comes to long-term dividend stocks, Snap-On (NYSE:SNA) is another name to consider. The industrial tool maker’s dividend (current forward yield of 2.62%) has increased by 14.5% on average annually over the past five years.', 'Admittedly, this level of dividend growth may not seem sustainable. After all, forecasts call for mixed results in the coming years. So then, why make SNA stock a “set and forget” long-term buy? While encountering a rough patch today, over a longer time frame Snap-On has demonstrated consistent profitability growth.', 'Furthermore, Snap-On beat expectations when it last reported earnings. Future results could come in much stronger than sell-side estimates suggest. Reasonably-priced at 15.2 times forward earnings, there may even be room for an expansion of SNA’s forward multiple. Growth re-acceleration, success with a recent acquisition, or even greater investor awareness may result in an eventual re-rating for Snap-On shares.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'With a forward dividend yield of 0.79%, Visa (NYSE:V) at first may not seem like a noteworthy dividend stock. Yet while the company, one of the world’s leading payment technology firms, sports a low yield, said yield has been growing at a rapid clip.', 'That is, payouts for V stock have grown by around 16.3% on average annually over the past five years. Such payout growth may be poised to continue. As I argued previously, numerous factors point to the company continuing to report double-digit earnings growth in the years to come.', 'The largest factor is the global pivot away from using cash to using cards/digital payment options for consumer transactions. This long-term trend is of course also a good sign when it comes to further price appreciation. This should outweigh any near-term concerns about the stock’s valuation (26.7 times forward earnings) and low yield.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

At the forefront: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), and Boston Beer\xa0(NYSE: SAM). These drink kings have mastered the art of staying fresh. This year, they look less like everyday investment opportunities and more like golden tickets for your portfolio. So, let's dive in and see how these industry giants could put some pep in your investments, mixing tried-and-true methods with innovative twists that could really quench your thirst for solid returns."", ""Coca-Cola isn't just about that famous soda we all know. It's a global powerhouse with a knack for mixing things up in the beverage industry. Beyond the classic Coke, it's got a lineup that's as varied as our taste buds. Think Fairlife's nutritious milk and Costa Coffee's rich brews. These brands are Coca-Cola's way of showing it's not just sticking to the old script; it's out there, exploring new flavors and trends. It's Coke's way of staying ahead in the game, catering to everyone, everywhere."", ""Coca-Cola's most recent quarterly performance delivered a robust 8% leap in net revenue to a cool $12 billion, coupled with earnings per share (EPS) jumping to $0.71, delivering a 9% increase alongside an 11% surge in organic revenue. These numbers demonstrate Coca-Cola's knack for smart pricing and thriving in diverse market conditions, making it a standout pick for investors seeking both profit and stability."", 'But Coca-Cola goes beyond selling sodas to establish its dominance. Its splash at the FIFA Women\'s World Cup 2023 put its products front and center in that community, a strategic move that bolstered its share in the bustling nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sector, delivering outsize gains in the Asia Pacific region during the event. Coca-Cola said it crafted ""an innovative campaign to build on the legacy of the tournament and celebrate the changing narrative occurring in women’s football. In football fields across both co-host nations, Australia and New Zealand, Coca‑Cola has displayed and activated five powerful statements showing the progress being made."". In a beverage market where standing out is as tough as it gets, Coca-Cola once again shows it knows how to play the game and win.', ""And let's not forget how Coca-Cola stands tall against market ups and downs. With an armory of diverse products and a strong global footprint, it navigates currency swings and competition with ease. And don't forget its dividend track record -- more than 60 years of consecutive dividend growth and the stock is currently yielding around 3% and dishing out $1.84 per share annually. For anyone looking to mix some reliability into their investment blend, Coca-Cola continues serving up just the right flavor."", ""PepsiCo, renowned for its sodas like Pepsi and Mountain Dew, maintains a dominant presence in the snack world with popular names like Lay's, Doritos, and Quaker. This strategic fusion of snack and beverage brands secures a stable revenue stream and further enhances PepsiCo's resilience in a competitive market."", 'PepsiCo turned heads last quarter with a hefty 6.7% jump in net revenue, crossing the $23 billion mark, alongside a remarkable 16% uptick in EPS. What does this tell investors? Simply put, PepsiCo proves a master when it comes to steering through economic twists and turns while keeping its profit game strong, making it a choice pick for those eyeing a reliable investment.', 'PepsiCo always seems to be on the move, tuning into what consumers want. Think about the move to offer healthier snacks and jumping into the energy drink scene with its 2020 acquisition of Rockstar. This strategic alignment keeps it in sync with changing tastes and lifestyles. By diversifying its lineup, PepsiCo surges ahead of the curve.', ""Through the rough tides of global supply chain hiccups and stiff competition, PepsiCo navigates with a steady hand. Its focus on being efficient and smart in its operations and marketing keeps it sailing ahead. Looking forward, PepsiCo isn't just promising more of the same; it's plotting a course for growth and resilience, making Pepsi a name to bet on in the ever-shifting landscape of the beverage and snack market."", 'The Boston Beer Company, known for its iconic Samuel Adams beer, breaks the traditional brewery boundaries with its ""beyond beer"" category, delivering game changers including Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea.', ""In the third quarter of 2023, Boston Beer reported a net revenue increase, breaking the $601 million mark, a modest 0.9% rise. But diluted earnings per share soared to $3.70, marking a solid 9% surge. Don't forget the impressive gross margin, which now stands at a healthy 45.7%. So, while the revenue growth might not be a tea party, these numbers demonstrate it's got the knack for managing costs effectively and keeping the profits flowing, even when the market throws challenges its way."", ""The company's strategic focus on brands like Twisted Tea and Hard Mountain Dew delivered. Twisted Tea, for instance, has consistently gained popularity, becoming a leading brand in the flavored malt beverage category. Hard Mountain Dew, a recent venture with PepsiCo, is also showing promising growth."", ""Boston Beer has faced its share of challenges, with fluctuating shipment volumes and competitive pressures in the craft beer segment at the fore. However, its proactive approach toward developing strong margins and investing wisely in diverse brands has helped mitigate these issues. Its third-quarter results include no debt, a stunning feat from a company that also holds over $310 million in cash reserves. Boston Beer's strong balance sheet gives the company the resilience to overcome minor hurdles and continue to grow."", ""Looking into 2024, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Boston Beer shine as top-notch investment contenders. With their remarkable track records, these beverage companies bring a fusion of financial strength, innovative strategies, and adaptability to the table. So, as you think about where to invest your money, remember this: In a world where change is the only sure thing, it's smart to put your trust in those who've mastered the art of adaptation."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

The three stocks we explore today all report their quarterly results during the week of January 22.', 'The downturn heading into fourth-quarter earnings season has been sparked by a mixture of much-deserved profit-taking and slightly recalibrated interest rate outlooks.', 'Thankfully, the Fed is certain to cut rates in 2024 and the outlook for Q4 earnings has improved since the big banks started reporting last week. Plus, current Zacks estimates showcase impressive earnings expansion in 2024 and 2025.

Everyone still needs clothes and shoes to go outside unless they want some curious (or horrified) looks. But this ongoing digitization is forcing apparel and footwear retailers–that once only had brick-and-mortar stores–to respond with omnichannel offerings.
