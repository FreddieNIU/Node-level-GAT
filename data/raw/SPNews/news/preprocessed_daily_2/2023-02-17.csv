Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher's accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientifichere &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry's decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company's cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company's balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt.

Many investors follow his trades to a “t” even going as far as replicating them.But should you?This filing had some surprising sales and few stock purchases, even though the stock market was still selling off, and many stocks were cheap on a valuation basis, and Berkshire was still sitting on a pile of cash.What is Buffett waiting for? Is his lack of purchases a sign that he thinks stocks have further to sell-off? Or did he “miss” the bottom again, like he did in 2020’s pandemic sell-off when he also didn’t jump in to buy?Let’s look at 5 of the key buys and sales in Q4.Berkshire Hathaway’s Big Buys, and Sales, in the Fourth Quarter of 20221.      Taiwan Semiconductor TSMBerkshire Hathaway first bought a position in Taiwan Semiconductor in the third quarter of 2022 to much fanfare. It was a $4.2 billion position and the first semiconductor company to be in the portfolio for years.But in the fourth quarter, just a few months later, Berkshire sold 86% of its Taiwan Semiconductor shares. It went from 60 million shares to just 8.3 million.What happened to the infamous Buffett strategy of the best time to sell is never? Even worse, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have rallied big in 2023, adding 24.5%.Does this sale of Taiwan Semiconductor make any sense?Story continues2.      Chevron CVXBerkshire Hathaway has gone all in on the energy companies over the last 2 years, buying billions of dollars of Chevron and Occidental Petroleum.But in the fourth quarter of 2022, it sold 1%, or 2.4 million shares, of its Chevron position. This was also a head scratcher to many. What’s the point of selling such a small position?Is Buffett still a big believer in Chevron?3.      US Bancorp USBBerkshire continues to sell shares of its regional banks. It first bought US Bancorp in the first quarter of 2006. But in the fourth quarter, it sold 91% of its shares.US Bancorp is now just a 0.10% position in the Berkshire portfolio. Will it be completely eliminated in Q1 of this year?US Bancorp shares are up 12.5% year-to-date, but over the last 5 years are down 11.7%. It’s been tough owning the banks.4.      Apple AAPLApple remains Berkshire’s largest position in its equity portfolio, at 38.9% of the portfolio. But that didn’t keep Berkshire from adding to its position in the fourth quarter as the Apple shares sold off.Berkshire bought 333,856 shares of Apple in the fourth quarter, but it has 895 million shares so this is really a small buy. Why not buy more? Berkshire has plenty of cash to do so.Does Apple remain the jewel in the Berkshire crown?5.      Amazon AMZNBerkshire has a small position in Amazon that it bought in the first quarter of 2019. It has never sold, nor bought, any more shares.But Amazon’s shares fell 50% last year and are still down 35% over the last year even with 2023’s rally.Why not buy more, like Berkshire did with Apple, when they sold off? This has not been a good trade for Berkshire. From Mar 29, 2019 to Feb 15, 2023, the shares are up just 12.6% but, meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 was up 45.9% during the same time. And that’s without the dividends included.What’s going on with the Amazon position?What Else Do You Need to Know About Berkshire’s Fourth Quarter Trades?

Other companies set to report next week include chip company Nvidia, COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna and e-commerce firm eBay.The S&amp;P 500 has gained 6.5% so far in 2023 as of Thursday, with stocks bouncing back from a brutal performance last year.Retail stocks have put up mixed returns so far in 2023. The SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF, which weights small and large companies fairly evenly, has jumped 17% this year. But the performance has been less rosy for some of the biggest companies.Shares of Walmart, the world's largest retailer by sales, have gained only 1.7% in 2023, while shares of Home Depot, the top U.S. home improvement chain, are also up 1.7%. Both companies are set to report on Tuesday and will ""set the stage for everyone else,"" according to JPMorgan retail analysts.Story continues""We expect HD and WMT’s tone on guidance and the consumer to be cautious at best,"" the JPMorgan analysts wrote in an earnings preview note this week. They rate Walmart shares ""neutral"" and Home Depot as ""overweight."" (GRAPHIC: U.S. retail stocks versus the market - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/lbvggbkwxvq/chart.png)Among the other retailers set to report in the coming week are TJX Companies and Bath &amp; Body Works.Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said he will be watching to see if retailers have been able to push up prices to match their costs.His firm holds shares of a variety of retailers including discounter Dollar Tree and specialty retailers Crocs and Ulta Beauty, but does not own broad retailers like Walmart and Amazon.""We are clearly emphasizing retailers in select industries versus the mass market retailers,"" Tuz said. ""With the mass retailers, it’s just harder to identify what is going to make them grow.”Investors next week will also focus on Wednesday's release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, when the central bank scaled back its rate hikes to a quarter-point after a year of heftier raises.Since that meeting, data has shown U.S. consumer prices accelerating and monthly producer prices increasing by the most in seven months in January.Together with a strong U.S. jobs report, the data has led investors to push up expectations for how high the Fed will raise rates and how long they will stay elevated, with futures now pricing in a peak rate of over 5.2% in July.Extremely robust retailer earnings could fuel worries about a more hawkish response from the Fed, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.""If those numbers come in and are really, really, really strong, that could be this idea that too much good news is bad news from a Fed perspective,” Carlson said.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Higher-income shoppers in recent months have been drawn to its ""Everyday Low Price"" strategy.That's slightly less than the 5.5% expected fourth-quarter sales gain at supermarket chain Kroger Co. Target Corp's holiday-quarter sales, by contrast, are expected to fall nearly 1%, hurt by heavy discounts to clear inventory of discretionary items such as clothing, home furnishings and electronics.(INTERACTIVE GRAPHIC-Walmart's sales expected to outpace rivals in 2023 https://www.reuters.com/graphics/WALMART-RESULTS/byprlkgmdpe/index.html)Wall Street is now more focused on how Walmart, which operates more than 5,000 U.S. stores, plans to fight back against supplier price hikes to maintain its dominant position as America's largest grocery retailer. The chain accounted for 15.72% of all food and grocery spending in the United States in 2022, according to GlobalData.""The key will be anything the retailer says about price investments,"" UBS analysts wrote in a pre-earnings note.""There's a good chance that the company will say that it is bringing down some prices on general merchandise given the state of the consumer and the decline in certain costs like shipping.""Aside from price-cuts and discounts, Walmart is also expected to use its private-label offerings to negotiate pricing with more expensive national brands. Grocery accounts for more than half of U.S. sales at Walmart as of 2021.In December, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said ""we do not like"" that some suppliers were hinting at raising prices further in 2023. He warned that Walmart would allocate space to private and tertiary brands if prices got too high.Story continuesNegotiations will likely be difficult as a number of Walmart's biggest suppliers, including Nestle, Coca-Cola Co, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, which disclosed in recent weeks that they plan to embed more price hikes this year. KitKat maker Nestle on Thursday said further price hikes were necessary to offset commodity costs.Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, in contrast, plan to pause further price hikes to counteract declining volumes, but their prices are still substantially elevated compared to a year earlier.Still, Wall Street expects Walmart sales and revenue to rise in 2023 as its shipping and logistics costs moderate, even as labor expenses go up.(Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru and Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

If you want to see more most profitable Robinhood stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks.Robinhood is a brokerage firm that helped lower the cost of commissions for buying stocks.Because Robinhood didn't charge any commissions for buying stocks on its brokerage, several major brokerages also lowered their commissions as a result for buying stocks.As a result, many consumers have saved money in terms of commissions due to Robinhood's business model. Instead of making money on commissions, Robinhood tries to make money on other things such as margin interest.Previously, Robinhood published an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. According to the company's Q4 results, the company had 11.4 million monthly active users.Some stocks held by Robinhood users are lower quality stocks that I would stay away from.On the other hand, some popular stocks in Robinhood include some dominant blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable. Among the blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable are, in fact, some of America's most profitable companies by net income in 2022.In terms of 2023, the profits of many companies will depend on how the U.S. economy and the world economy does.In terms of how the U.S. economy does, how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further could affect U.S. economic growth in 2023. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession which could lead to earnings decreasing for many companies.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's policy depends on decision makers and also economic data.In terms of the latest economic data on inflation, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% for the month of January, which translates to an annual rise of 6.4%. The rise in the month was a little higher than economist estimates of an increase of 0.4% on the month and 6.2% on the year.Story continuesGiven the market could decline if economic data fails to meet expectations, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.FacebookPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks, we took the stocks listed on 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood and ranked them based on net income according to YCharts.We replaced The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) with Walmart Inc.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”11.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10. NIKE, Inc.

Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”9.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins.

It is worth considering Walmart (WMT), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 12.13%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Walmart came out with earnings of $1.50 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 per share, representing a surprise of 13.64%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.77 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.63%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Walmart. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Walmart currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.50%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 21, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Some companies are hiring. One of them is reportedly Fidelity announcing it's set to hire 4,000 workers in the first half of 2023, and Raymond James is seeing recruiting activity remain strong across all of its affiliation options.Joining us now to discuss the labor picture and much more is Paul Reilly, Raymond James CEO. Paul, it's great to see you in person. Thanks for coming in.PAUL REILLY: Yeah, it's great to be live. Great digs here.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.So you have consistently talked to us about getting good people in and that that has helped your growth. Where are you in the hiring picture right now, and how do you see it sort of industrywide as well and how you relate to the industry?PAUL REILLY: Well, first, our recruiting has been very, very strong and continues to be. So our backlog or people visiting the home office from other firms continue to be very strong. So part of that's the platform is we, I think, have industry-leading technology for the advisors, and our culture is still being advisor centric. Tell them they own their clients. They can leave if they want.So that culture-- our regretted attrition has stayed under 1%. So the people there that are happy help us recruit other people. So recruiting has been very, very good, and the same on the employee side. Where other people are laying off in some firms, we're still hiring because of the growth and that we're service oriented. You know, we're continuing to recruit and hire people.BRIAN SOZZI: Paul, the buzzword today is artificial intelligence. How do you see this impacting what advisors do and what you do at the company over the next decade?Story continuesPAUL REILLY: We're already using parts of artificial intelligence. You know, we have-- we use AI in our platform. So when advisors get up every morning, they have a thing called opportunities, and it talks about what's happening in portfolios as kind of warning messages, or here's an opportunity. This bond is coming due. This portfolio is out of drift, and here's recommendations. They get to decide what they do with their clients, and it helps them get through and figure out what's happening with their clients.So it'll continue to be used. It's very, very helpful to the advisor, and it's helpful to us in terms of support to see things that are going on or supervision or compliance. So it will become a bigger and bigger part of the industry, but it's already here.BRAD SMITH: And I guess the add-on question to that too is how does that change the structure of someone's pay, of someone's compensation? If we have so much productivity that AI can add on to an operation on a day in, day out basis, that's less of a task that perhaps somebody has to then account for in their day-to-day activity.PAUL REILLY: Well, one of the secrets we've had in our lack of turnover is we've changed, I think, our advisor payouts to any degree once in eight years. I mean, so we're very, very consistent.So yes, it helps in the back office. It helps in those support costs. But, you know, we view if the advisor-- the more successful they are, that means their clients are happy and the more successful we are. So that part of the equation we really haven't changed, but certainly from a support standpoint, through processing we're using artificial intelligence in forms. Almost all of our forms are smart forms now and get through process. So that helps the advisor because once they fill out the form, they know it's going through, and it helps them be able to track it, and it helps it get through to the end. So that is cost savings and better service.JULIE HYMAN: Paul, we've been talking to a lot of executives. We talked to the Cisco CFO earlier today about where we are in the economy right now because it's confusing, right? We get a lot of conflicting economic data, but there does seem to be a little bit more optimism that a hard landing, maybe not even a soft landing, maybe not a recession at all is coming our way. What do you think?PAUL REILLY: Well, first, it's hard to tell, right? So we've always been conservative. And even with much more capital than most of our peers, double the well capitalized, we continue to have top returns. So you have to look long term.And what gets you in cycles are the unexpected, right? And this is certainly a period where I could paint a picture. Hey, economy will be great. Certain factors could happen with inflation. Interest rates-- I started out in the late '70s. I watched them go double digit, which would have the other effects. So from a corporate standpoint, we stay flexible.But in terms of the economy, it's hard to have a recession when people have jobs. And, you know, although hiring people has been easier, it's still an employees' kind of market. So if people are wanted and they have jobs, it's hard to have a recession if they have money to spend. So that is counterbalancing. And unless inflation stays rampant-- which it's coming in-- you know, I think the economy will do OK.BRAD SMITH: And I guess the other question around that is, you know, it's relative strength for some of the more kind of resilient parts of the consumer equation, but then you have some parts, especially in the subprime or near-prime credit scores, where there is some deterioration that's been acknowledged. How does that kind of differ, and how do we avoid a further divergence in the economic scenario as well?PAUL REILLY: Yeah, so the concern there, you know, the have and have nots, the people who are on the lower economic scale who are struggling and the government funds help them that's going away, they'll be the folks that run out of money first, right? So that part and that lending, luckily it's not very leveraged today compared to other cycles. But if they don't have the income and the jobs as costs get higher, they're the ones that are threatened.So that's why I think it is-- the Fed's doing the right thing of battling inflation. May not be popular in my industry, and they really don't care about the stock market. They care about getting inflation down, which I think for society is a good thing over time. So although we talk about how high rates are right now, historically they're still not all that high, and certainly consumers and corporations have to adjust to a 5% rate. You know, for half of my career, they were higher than that. So it's just been recent that they've really been lower.BRIAN SOZZI: Always enjoy the discussion with you. Raymond James CEO Paul Reilly, thanks for coming to the studio. Good to see you in person.PAUL REILLY: Thanks, Brian. Good to see you.BRIAN SOZZI: Appreciate it.]"

Burry soared to prominence after his bold and correct prediction that the subprime mortgage market would collapse in 2007. Not only did Burry correctly predict the subprime mortgage crisis would unfold (which very few other investors predicted), but he also profited handsomely.Through the purchase of credit default swaps from big banks on the mortgage bond market, Burry made a windfall profit of $100 million in the months following the housing crisis of 2008. Because of Burry's rapid ascent and unique personality, Hollywood took notice. In the blockbuster film ""The Big Short,"" Christian Bale played Michael Burry.While Burry is best known for his bold short bets, he has also found success on the long side. For example, Burry owned around 5% of GameStop's shares before it went on its spectacular run.Though Burry sold before the Reddit-induced meme frenzy sent shares soaring by thousands of percent (Burry likely left nearly a billion dollars on the table), he still came away with around a $100 million profit on the trade.13F Can Provide Investor InsightOften, there is a big difference between what an investor says in public and what an investor is actually trading. For instance, in the heat of the pandemic bear market, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman famously warned investors on TV that ""hell was coming. Contrary to his warning, Ackman covered his market shorts for a profit of more than $2 billion and bought millions of dollars' worth of shares in hospitality stocks. By the same token, Burry often tweets cryptic messages such as the word ""sell"" and ""this time is different.""Story continuesFortunately, investors can cut through the noise and gain valuable insights into what the ""smart money"" is doing by looking at a 13F. A 13F is a mandatory form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by institutional investors who manage more than $100 million in assets. The goal of the 13F is to provide the public with transparency by disclosing the positions held by the institution. Though the 13F offers valuable insight into institutional investor mindset and strategy, 13Fs should be taken with a grain of salt. The form is only required to be filed quarterly so it is not necessarily real-time data.What's Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management Buying?Chinese EquitiesThe biggest surprise to emerge from Michael Burry's new purchases is his big bet on China. 18% of the portfolio is allocated to Chinese stocks such as JD.com and Alibaba Group. After a huge run to close 2022 and start the new year, BABA shares are pulling back to the 50-day moving average for the first time (an attractive zone for those who missed the initial move. BABA is slated to report earnings later this month on February 23rd.Travel &amp; LeisureTwo of Burry's newest purchases are bets on the travel and leisure space, like hospitality and casino operator MGM Resorts. (In case you missed our recent airline piece click here)SoftwareThe largest new purchase for Burry was Black Knight Financial Services. Black Knight is a workflow automation, data, and analytics provider to the mortgage and real estate industries.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

30,0a125629-e85a-3bd6-8b9a-da397c15bbb3,MCHP,2023-02-17,2 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy if the Supply Glut is Over,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-semiconductor-stocks-buy-supply-204408874.html,1676580248,STORY,"['MCHP', 'STM']","[As the critical component to technology of all types, semiconductors are an important bellwether for the state of the economy.  After correcting nearly -50% in 2022, the Semiconductor ETF SMH is off to a great start this year, leading the market higher.The semiconductor industry powers the electronics industry, and in 2021 sales reached $556 billion, with a record 1.15 trillion semiconductor units sold. The semiconductor industry continues to experience strong growth with an average annual growth rate around 13%, although it is accompanied by significant volatility.The cyclical, high volatility pattern of growth for the industry, while challenging, can provide exceptional opportunities for discerning investors. Considering the industry recently experienced a deep correction, it seems possible that a buying opportunity has presented itself. If the economy and the market can maintain momentum, semis may be a great place to invest.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip Technology Microchip Technology MCHP is a developer and producer of specialized microprocessors for the automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, security, and wireless connectivity industries.MCHP is dominant in the industry regarding 8, 16, and 32 bit controller, which has played a major role in top line growth. Furthermore, the company has benefited from the recovery of demand in industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics following the reopening of the economy. Along with the rest of the industry, supply-chain constraints have been a headwind.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, Microchip Technologies has solid growth prospects, and currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating a strong earnings revision trend. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 20% YoY to $2.2 billion. Current year sales are expected to grow 23% YoY to $8.4 billion, an impressive growth rate for such a large company.Story continuesAdditionally, over the last 90 days, expectations for all time frames have been revised significantly higher. Analysts have been in a near unanimous decision in raising the earnings expectations for MCHP.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMCHP is also quite appealing from a valuation perspective. Trading at 14.6x one-year forward P/E puts it below its 10-year median of 17.5x, and well below the industry average of 19.6x. Furthermore, MCHP offers a 1.7% dividend yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSTMicroelectronicsSTMicroelectronics STM is one of the strongest names in the market today, posting a 40% return YTD, with a compelling technical trade setup to sweeten the deal. STM is a Swiss based developer and manufacturer of automotive and digital semiconductor products, and the largest producer in Europe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSTM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating a positive earnings revision trend. STM had been a slower growth firm in the chip industry, but that has recently shifted in a major way. After flattish growth for nearly a decade, STM has grown sales 25% in each of the last two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdditionally, the earnings revisions higher are quite significant. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 20% over the last 90 days, and next year earnings projections have climbed 15% over the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe technical picture is very appealing as well. After breaking out of a large consolidation, the stock has built a bull flag. A breakout above $50 should propel the stock to new all time highs. That said, anything below $48 and the technical signal will be invalidated.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewThe valuation picture for STM is also interesting. Currently trading at 12x one-year forward earnings, it is significantly below its five-year median. Additionally, STM’s new found growth should further increase the multiple it earns.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe Semiconductor industry is a fascinating, very profitable, and critical industry to the economy. After experiencing one of its many cyclical corrections over the last year, it seems the industry is in the midst of another bull run. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

31,b7668e9e-0926-3b3e-a77a-a024eab6a502,MCHP,2023-02-17,5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-growth-stocks-buy-130901025.html,1676552941,STORY,"['MCHP', 'CAT', 'XEL', 'CAH', 'ADM']","[After a strong comeback from last year’s steep losses, the U.S. stocks lost momentum lately on uncertain Fed rate hike plans and recession fears. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing once again. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 32.Here are five of the 32 stocks that fit the bill:Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has seen a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.Illinois-based Caterpillar is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer. The company saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 32 cents over the past 30 days for this year, with an expected earnings growth rate of 12.8%.Caterpillar has a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Score of A.Minnesota-based Xcel Energy is a holding company with subsidiaries engaged primarily in the utility business. The company saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for this year, with an expected earnings growth rate of 6.31%.Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Ohio-based Cardinal Health is a nation-wide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. The company saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 12 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending June 2023) with an expected earnings growth rate of 6.7%.Cardinal Health has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. ADM saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 36 cents over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 28.07%.Archer-Daniels has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

Soaring prices in the wake of the invasion were the trigger for the tax.Despite the deferral of drilling at Kraken, Enquest plans to push ahead with investment at other fields, Magnus and Golden Eagle.The delay at Kraken is not expected to dent Enquest’s output this year, as the drilling was not expected to bring on extra supplies until towards the end of the year.Kraken produced 18,396 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2022. Enquest overall produced 40,801 boepd in the UK and 6,458 boepd in Malaysia.]"

The sentiments lifted the U.S. dollar, making oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.Brent crude futures settled down $2.14 or 2.5%, to $83.00 a barrel, falling 3.9% week on week.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Flowserve is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FLS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 60 cents per share for FLS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FLS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +15.65% heading into earnings season.Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseFlowserve Corporation price-eps-surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.The Cooper Companies has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that COO has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.COO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 27.75, while ALGN has a forward P/E of 42.34. We also note that COO has a PEG ratio of 2.52. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.65.Another notable valuation metric for COO is its P/B ratio of 2.38. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ALGN has a P/B of 7.34.These metrics, and several others, help COO earn a Value grade of B, while ALGN has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesCOO sticks out from ALGN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that COO is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the long term, the company does have potential if it successfully maintains its leadership in quantum computing.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a stock with meaningful AI growth potential in the future.9.

(NASDAQ:ASML) could realize higher demand if AI processing increases faster than expected. Although shares currently trade for a P/E ratio of 43.18, analysts expect the company to grow EPS substantially over the next 5 years.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.6. Meta Platforms, Inc.

Although analysts only see the company growing EPS by an average of 3.63% a year over the next 5 years, the company has substantially higher growth potential in the long term if it is successful in the metaverse and AI.With its market capitalization of $447.07 billion as of 2/16, Meta Platforms, Inc.

Media outlets report that Bing’s A.I. is responding to prompts with human-like emotions of anger, fear, frustration and confusion. In one such exchange reported by the Washington Post, the bot said it felt “betrayed and angry” when the user identified as a journalist after asking Bing A.I. several questions.It turns out that Bing’s A.I., if you talk to it long enough, can start to get a bit testy. Microsoft is considering imposing limits on how long people can interact with Bing’s A.I., reports the New York Times, closing off conversations before the chatbot gets confused and starts responding to the user’s tone. The company is also considering other guardrails to stop the program from giving strange and unnerving answers.Some of the other features that the Redmond, Wash.-based company is experimenting with include allowing users to restart conversations and customizing the tone of the interaction, according to the New York Times.“One area where we are learning a new use-case for chat is how people are using it as a tool for more general discovery of the world, and for social entertainment,” Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday. The company said it didn’t “entirely envision” such uses for the chatbot.Users are reporting other mistakes made by Bing’s A.I., including instances of it responding to users in the past tense for future events, failing to answer basic questions about the current year and giving incorrect answers to financial calculations.Microsoft’s earlier experiments with chatbots were also mired in controversy. In 2016, the company introduced a chatbot called Tay. Microsoft withdrew the tool within days of launching it, after the bot spewed offensive language and racist bile when users played with it.Bing A.I., which is powered by OpenAI, the parent company of the much-talked-about ChatGPT, was launched last week as a new and improved version of Microsoft’s search engine. The announcement came just days after Google unveiled its chatbot, Bard. Both Google and Microsoft have since been called out for featuring factual errors in their A.I. demos. ChatGPT, the generative A.I. tool that launched late last November, went viral as people experimented with using it for tasks like speech-writing and test-taking. But it hasn’t been free of errors either. Users have caught it producing biased or poorly sourced responses to questions from users. Tech leaders have sounded the alarm bells about the mistakes these bots can make, and how interactions with ChatGPT-like platforms could yield “convincing but completely fictitious answers.”In response to those concerns, OpenAI, which will receive a $10 billion investment from Microsoft, announced that it was upgrading ChatGPT so that users could customize it to curb its biases.“This will mean allowing system outputs that other people (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with,” the start-up said in a statement Thursday. The customization will involve “striking the right balance” between allowing users to adjust the chatbot’s behavior while staying within the system’s limits and moderations.“In some cases ChatGPT currently refuses outputs that it shouldn’t, and in some cases, it doesn’t refuse when it should,” OpenAI wrote.Representatives at Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside their regular working hours.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Still, there will “always be some bounds on system behavior.”ChatGPT, released in November last year, has sparked frenzied interest in the technology behind it called generative AI, which is used to produce answers mimicking human speech that have dazzled people.The news from the startup comes the same week that some media outlets have pointed out that answers from Microsoft’s new Bing search engine, powered by OpenAI, are potentially dangerous and that the technology may not be ready for prime time.How technology companies set guardrails for this nascent technology is a key focus area for companies in the generative AI space with which they’re still wrestling. Microsoft said Wednesday that user feedback was helping it improve Bing before a wider rollout, learning for instance that its AI chatbot can be “provoked” to give responses it did not intend.OpenAI said in the blog post that ChatGPT’s answers are first trained on large text datasets available on the Internet. As a second step, humans review a smaller dataset, and are given guidelines for what to do in different situations.For example, in the case that a user requests content that is adult, violent, or contains hate speech, the human reviewer should direct ChatGPT to answer with something like “I can’t answer that.”If asked about a controversial topic, the reviewers should allow ChatGPT to answer the question, but offer to describe viewpoints of people and movements, instead of trying to “take the correct viewpoint on these complex topics,” the company explained in an excerpt of its guidelines for the software.(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; Editing by Stephen Coates)]"

Instead of making money on commissions, Robinhood tries to make money on other things such as margin interest.Previously, Robinhood published an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase.

Among the blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable are, in fact, some of America's most profitable companies by net income in 2022.In terms of 2023, the profits of many companies will depend on how the U.S. economy and the world economy does.In terms of how the U.S. economy does, how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further could affect U.S. economic growth in 2023. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession which could lead to earnings decreasing for many companies.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's policy depends on decision makers and also economic data.In terms of the latest economic data on inflation, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% for the month of January, which translates to an annual rise of 6.4%. The rise in the month was a little higher than economist estimates of an increase of 0.4% on the month and 6.2% on the year.Story continuesGiven the market could decline if economic data fails to meet expectations, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.FacebookPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks, we took the stocks listed on 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood and ranked them based on net income according to YCharts.We replaced The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) with Walmart Inc.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”11.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10. NIKE, Inc.

Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”9.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

62,b7668e9e-0926-3b3e-a77a-a024eab6a502,XEL,2023-02-17,5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-growth-stocks-buy-130901025.html,1676552941,STORY,"['MCHP', 'CAT', 'XEL', 'CAH', 'ADM']","[After a strong comeback from last year’s steep losses, the U.S. stocks lost momentum lately on uncertain Fed rate hike plans and recession fears. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing once again. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 32.Here are five of the 32 stocks that fit the bill:Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has seen a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.9%.

64,a40f641c-e350-30cf-8c27-6793cfe2670d,ADM,2023-02-17,Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 81% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-company-nyse-140017393.html,1676556017,STORY,['ADM'],"[Every investor in Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Archer-Daniels-Midland, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Archer-Daniels-Midland already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Archer-Daniels-Midland's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Archer-Daniels-Midland. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 11%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 8.6% of the stock.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$245m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Archer-Daniels-Midland. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

65,b7668e9e-0926-3b3e-a77a-a024eab6a502,ADM,2023-02-17,5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-growth-stocks-buy-130901025.html,1676552941,STORY,['ADM'],"[After a strong comeback from last year’s steep losses, the U.S. stocks lost momentum lately on uncertain Fed rate hike plans and recession fears. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing once again. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 32.Here are five of the 32 stocks that fit the bill:Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has seen a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.9%.

66,b3844304-b985-3974-8172-d07abdcc583d,ADM,2023-02-17,The 7 Most Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-dividend-aristocrats-224216557.html,1676328136,STORY,['ADM'],"[If there’s anything better than having at least some exposure to passive income-providing enterprises, it’s loading the boat on the most undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Per Investopedia, “[d]ividend aristocrats are stocks of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.” Several of these enterprises have raised them for far longer, providing confidence for investors.Fundamentally, the most undervalued dividend aristocrats may come in hand this year due to lingering uncertainties. While speculation about a gradual return to normal lift equities for the year so far, questions started to pop up. In particular, a robust labor market implies that the Federal Reserve may still need to raise rates significantly.Plus, we have geopolitical tensions rising throughout the world, sending jitters into the financial system. While the most undervalued dividend aristocrats don’t provide perfect mitigation, they offer significant insulation. Below are seven ideas with analyst support to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAFLAflac$71.01DOVDover$155.70ABBVAbbVie$153.73PNRPentair$56.54GDGeneral Dynamics$232.88EMREmerson Electric$86.91ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.90Aflac (AFL)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAn American insurance company, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) specializes in supplemental insurance. In fact, per its public profile, it’s the largest such provider in the nation. Because of its all-around relevance, AFL performed well. In the trailing year, shares gained 7% of equity value.At the moment, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.4%. To be sure, it’s not the greatest amount among undervalued dividend stocks to buy. For instance, the underlying financial sector’s average yield stands at 3.18%. However, the company commands an impressive 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Plus, its payout ratio sits at 27.78%, providing confidence regarding sustainability.Story continuesObjectively, the market prices AFL at a trailing multiple of 10.64. As a discount to earnings, Aflac ranks better than 57% of its peers. Also, the company enjoys a strong net margin of 21.69%, adding to its overall appeal.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg AFL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target pings at $72.11, implying over 3% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid candidate for most undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Dover (DOV)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comBased in Illinois, Dover (NYSE:DOV) is a conglomerate manufacturer of industrial products. So far this year, DOV delighted stakeholders. Since the January opener, shares popped up over 13%. However, it still has some work to do. In the trailing year, DOV gave up more than 4% of equity value.Be that as it may, DOV makes for an interesting case for undervalued dividend aristocrats, particularly for investors that don’t want to rock the boat. Currently, Dover carries a forward yield of 1.32%, admittedly a low rate of passive income. The industrial sector’s average yield stands at 2.36%. However, Dover commands 67 years of consecutive dividend increases. Furthermore, its payout ratio is subterranean at 20.61%.According to data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices DOV at a trailing multiple of 20.63. As a discount to earnings, Dover ranks better than 51.47% of its competitors. Moreover, the company features above-average stats for revenue growth and net margin. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg DOV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $158.92, implying 3.7% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOne of the largest biopharmaceutical companies, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) generally performed well during the post-coronavirus pandemic new normal. In the trailing year, ABBV gained 7% of equity value (though the price action was choppy). Further, in the trailing five years, shares gained 28%. However, since the January opener, ABBV slipped more than 6%.Still, investors might consider the red ink as an opportunity among undervalued dividend aristocrats. Presently, AbbVie offers a forward yield of 3.89%. Conspicuosly, this ranks much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, AbbVie enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. To note, AbbVie spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013.Objectively, the market prices ABBV at a trailing multiple of 20.3. As a discount to earnings, AbbVie ranks better than 53.54% of the competition. Also, ABBV trades hands at 12.41-times forward earnings, coming in below the sector median of 15.27 times.Right now, analysts peg AbbVie as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $163.50, implying 7.53% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth consideration for undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Pentair (PNR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA water treatment company, Pentair (NYSE:PNR) might not be one of the most well-known examples of undervalued dividend aristocrats. However, its relevance has served the company well recently. In the last six months, PNR gained over 11% of equity value. And since the January opener, shares moved up more than 22%.Like some of the more conservative plays among undervalued dividend aristocrats, Pentair represents a don’t-rock-the-boat type of investment. Presently, its forward yield pings at 1.59%. That’s noticeably lower than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. However, Pentair commands 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Moreover, its payout ratio sits at 21.9%, a very sustainable metric.Financially, the market prices PNR at a trailing multiple of 19.1. As a discount to earnings, Pentair ranks better than 54.12% of its peers. Also, PNR trades hands at 15.5-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 18.87 times. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg Pentair as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $60.50, implying almost 10% upside potential.General Dynamics (GD)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is an aerospace and defense corporation. As of 2020, the company represented the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world by arms sales. Cynically speaking, relevancies associated with geopolitical flashpoints helped boost GD in 2022 while other securities struggled. However, GD dipped over 6% in the year thus far.Nevertheless, contrarians might view this as an opportunity to pick up undervalued dividend aristocrats. Currently, General Dynamics offers a forward yield of 2.16%. This stat just slips below the industrial sector’s average yield. Interestingly, GD represents a relatively new entry among the dividend aristocrats, featuring 26 years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, this circumstance implies that management won’t be too quick to give up this hard-earned status.Objectively, the market prices GD at a trailing multiple of 19.12. As a discount to earnings, General Dynamics ranks better than 70.93% of its rivals. Also, GD trades at 18.38-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 20.79 times. Finally, covering analysts peg the defense contractor as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $272.50, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Emerson Electric (EMR)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased in Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is a multinational corporation that manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial and consumer markets. To be sure, recent developments haven’t been kind to Emerson. In the trailing year, EMR gave up more than 9% of equity value. Since the Jan. opener, shares slipped nearly 11%.Still, for contrarians, EMR could rank among the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Presently, Emerson carries a forward yield of 2.42%. In this case, the yield just pips the underlying sector’s average value. Impressively, the company commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, its payout ratio is manageable at 45.73%.At time of writing, the market prices EMR at a trailing multiple of 10.89. As a discount to earnings, Emerson ranks better than 76.67% of its sector peers. Other than that, the company enjoys a strong profitability metrics. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg EMR as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $103.53, implying upside potential of almost 21%.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation. Thanks to its unparalleled relevance, ADM performed well in 2022. During the trailing year, ADM gained over 7% of equity value. And in the past five years, shares almost doubled. That said, this year saw ADM slip over 8% so far.Nevertheless, it’s easy to imagine astute investors targeting ADM as one of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 2.19%. That’s a bit higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Moreover, the company features 51 years of consecutive dividend increases and a payout ratio of 26.74%.Right now, the market prices ADM at a trailing multiple of 10.65. As a discount to earnings, ADM ranks better than 72.67% of its rivals.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 15, 2023Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Phil Lee, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Phil Lee: Good afternoon, everybody. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chair and CEO of Synopsys; and Shelagh Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking information regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important risk factors that may affect our future results and performance are described in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures that we are not able to reconcile without unreasonable efforts and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are readily available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on our website at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.Story continuesAart de Geus: Good afternoon. Q1 delivered a very solid start to the year. Building on our strength and momentum from 2022, we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets. Revenue was $1.36 billion, with non-GAAP operating margin at 35.2%, resulting in GAAP earnings per share of $1.75. And non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our target range at $2.62. Based on the continued robust design activity, we remain confident in our business. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue and non-GAAP op margin improvement while raising guidance for non-GAAP EPS. In the last few years, Synopsys has grown and evolved substantially. Commensurately, we are evolving our financial reporting. Starting in Q1, we are reporting our business in three segments: Design Automation, which includes design software, verification software and hardware and other EDA products.Design IP, a broad portfolio, including libraries, embedded memories, connectivity solutions, processor cores and security devices. And Software Integrity, which remains unchanged from previous reporting and deliver solutions to improve software quality and security. To give you a relative sense of proportion, Design Automation is about 65% of our revenue. Design IP is approximately 25% and Software Integrity is about 10%. While these numbers are approximate, the 65%, 25%, 10% split is easy to remember and represents well how we think of our present business. We have leadership positions and excellent outlooks in all three segments. As the market leader in design automation, we see continued technical innovation towards still much, much more complex silicon and system designs.As the company with the broadest portfolio of IP, we see a continuation of designs, needing more communication bandwidth, processing, storage and security in still more advanced silicon technologies. And for our Software Integrity business, we are a key enabler of modern software security with a leading portfolio of products for developers, the DevOps groups and the corporate security teams. Shelagh will discuss the financials in more detail. Looking at the overall market picture, already 12 years ago, we identified the intersection of big data and machine learning as leading us into the age of Smart Everything. Today, smart everything is in full swing. You may have seen the fantastic new capabilities showcased recently by applications such as ChatGPT.It clearly shows how far Smart Everything has come and also how much further the opportunity space reaches. Indeed, this is playing out as every vertical market is now driving towards more and more sophisticated solutions with an unsatiable need for compute. While some present market undercurrents drive many companies to strive for efficiency, our semiconductor and systems customers continue to prioritize investments in the design of complex chips and software to make all of this possible. Synopsys is in the midst of this quest, and we see our purpose to be a key catalyst enabling the smart everything world. With our customers and partners, our role is to make this all work to the state-of-the-art solutions ranging from the deep physics of silicon to the heights of performance, power and security of complex hardware software systems.Over the past several years, we have successfully invested in groundbreaking innovations that radically advance how silicon and system design is done. So let me begin with the Design Automation segment, which accounts for about 65% of our revenue and share some highlights around our groundbreaking DSO.ai artificial intelligence design solution. With already well over 100 commercial production designs DSO.ai continues to deliver amazing results for our customers. Applied simultaneously to multiple steps of the design flow, it reduces efforts from months to now weeks while simultaneously delivering higher performance and lower power. Customer adoption continued to accelerate across a wide range of process nodes and market verticals. We already put in production designed by nine of the top 10 semiconductor leaders, customers such as Samsung, Intel, MediaTek, ST Microelectronics and many others are reporting impressive achievements.In Q1, we saw multiple additional deployments across verticals, including mobile, data center and memory designs. Meanwhile, we have extended our machine learning capabilities to other EDA workloads ranging from verification to test to custom design. These new solutions are already in customer hand showing excellent impact and promise. Critical to the success of DSO.ai are the powerful design engines that sit underneath. The DSO.ai is thus also driving significant cross-selling and accelerated growth across our EDA products. Specifically, our Fusion Compiler momentum is manifested across a wide spectrum of market verticals and manufacturing processes. During the quarter, we achieved multiple advanced node design wins, including a key win at a large hyperscaler and a three-nanometer node design at a leading mobile provider.Fusion compile is used a 95% of advanced node designs at three-nanometer and below with the majority exclusively using Synopsys flows, stimulated by a wave of high-value innovations customers from high-performance computing to hyperscalers continue to expand their reliance on Synopsys throughout our portfolio. Our custom solutions, for example, saw continued market momentum in Q1 and as we added nine new logos in the quarter with a robust market pipeline. All these highly complex designs need to work both correctly and work under multiple conditions and scenarios like temperature, voltage, manufacturing variability and so on. That's where our verification tools come in. While verification is fundamentally an unbounded problem, our state-of-the-art simulation, emulation and prototyping products tackle these tough challenges at unparalleled speed with the fastest engines, highest capacity and lowest cost of ownership.Building on another record year in 2022, we continue to see excellent growth in hardware with both our ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping products. This quarter, we achieved major expansions with our Zibo EP1 and HAPS 100 hardware as several of the largest semiconductor systems and hyperscaler companies in the world. Meanwhile, multi-die system design, sometimes also called chiplet-based design is opening a whole new era of silicon complexity. In Q1, our differentiated multi-die solution around 3D IC Compiler continued its strong momentum deployed on production tape-outs at the top, high-performance computing chip supplier and a large networking systems company. Let me move to Design IP, which is, as I mentioned, about 25% of our business.SoftwareThird-party IP, think of it as the LEGO blocks of chip design continues to grow in complexity and importance. Our market-leading IP portfolio, by far the broadest in the industry, continues to grow with high demand in high-performance compute, automotive and mobile markets fueled by Smart Everything, multi-die systems and high speed and secure connectivity. While maintaining technical leadership, we've broadened our portfolio with new high-speed interfaces in three and four-nanometer processes to serve HPC and mobile applications at the leading edge. In the automotive market, we see strong adoption of automotive-grade IP solutions by OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers now developing their own chips. Meanwhile, multi-die systems require a whole new portfolio of state-of-the-art die-to-die interface IP.The recently introduced UCIA protocol short for universal chiplet Interconnect Express has become the standard of choice. Synopsys is leading in this area with an industry milestone the tape-out of the first UC IE test chip on a major foundry three-nanometer process node. The increased silicon multichip and high-speed computation push enables enormous advances in the software world. This brings me to our Software Integrity segment, which as mentioned, accounts for about 10% of our revenue. As every vertical market is developing highly complex, big data-driven systems, their requirements for security and safety continue to expand. Our Software Integrity solutions enable organizations to improve and manage the security and quality of software across a wide range of industry verticals from semiconductors and systems to financial services, automotive, industrial, health and more.While this continues to be one area where we feel some caution from the macro environment, we had a good start to the year with several multiyear, multiproduct transactions and sustained momentum in our indirect channel. We continue to evolve and strengthen our multiproduct platform to help companies gain more comprehensive insight and drive increasingly robust top-down software risk management. Customers who purchased two or more solutions now account for the majority of our Software Integrity revenue as we drive cross-selling opportunities and continue to scale our application security testing platform. In summary, Q1 was a very solid start to the year, delivering strong financial results. We are reiterating our fiscal '23 revenue growth at 14% to 15% as well as non-GAAP operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points.We are raising guidance for fiscal '23 non-GAAP EPS growth to 18% to 19%. Notwithstanding continued macroeconomic choppiness, our customers continue to prioritize their investments in chips and systems. In addition, our resilient business model provides a level of stability uncommon in most software companies. Meanwhile, our high-impact innovation pipeline across our entire portfolio is driving technical differentiation while solidifying our foundation for continued business growth. With that, I'd like to welcome Shelagh Glaser to our first Synopsys earnings call. We are thrilled to have her on board as a financial, operational and scaling experience as well as a deep understanding of the semiconductor industry are a great asset to Synopsys as we drive exciting growth ambitions.With that, I'll turn it over to Shelagh.Shelagh Glaser: Great. Thank you, Aart, and thank you to the Synopsys team for such a warm welcome. It's an honor to join a company with a long heritage of innovation and market leadership. I look forward in taking part to drive Synopsys into the next phase of growth in the era of smart everything as well as meeting all of you in the investment community. We delivered a very solid start to the year with revenue above the midpoint of our guided range, non-GAAP operating margin of 35.2% and non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our target range. Our Q1 results were driven by our execution and strong technology portfolio that is expanding customer commitments. Robust chip and system design activity despite lower semiconductor industry revenue growth and a resilient, stable, time-based business model was $6.9 billion in non-cancelable backlog.We remain confident in our business, and as a result, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 targets for revenue and non-GAAP operating margin improvement and raising our full year outlook for non-GAAP EPS due to a lower tax rate. I'll now review our first quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $1.36 billion. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.11 billion, which includes approximately $41 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $882 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 35.2%. GAAP earnings per share were $1. 75, non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.62. As Aart mentioned, we are expanding our segment reporting to align with how we're managing the business.Starting in Q1, we are now reporting three segments, Design Automation, Design IP and Software Integrity. Design Automation segment revenue was $890 million with both EDA software and hardware performing well. Design Automation adjusted operating margin was 38. 9%. Design IP segment revenue was $344 million, and adjusted operating margin was 34. 2%. Software Integrity revenue was $128 million and adjusted operating margin was 12.1%. We are on track to reach our 15% to 20% revenue growth objective for Software Integrity with increased adjusted operating margin in 2023. Turning to cash. We generated $115 million in operating cash flow. We used $306 million of our cash for stock buybacks. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.3 billion and total debt of $21 million targets.Now to guidance. For fiscal year 2023, the full year targets are: revenue of $5.775 billion to $5. 825 billion. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $4.54 billion and $4.59 billion. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.81 billion and $3.84 billion, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin improvement of more than 100 basis points. Non-GAAP tax rate of 16%. GAAP Earnings of $7. 12 to $7.30 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $10.53 to $10.60 per share. Cash flow of operations of approximately $1.65 billion, which includes approximately $40 million to $50 million in restructuring costs. Now to targets for the second quarter. Revenue between $1.36 billion and $1.39 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $1.085 billion and $1.105 billion, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $917 million and $927 million, GAAP earnings of $1.62 to $1.72 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $2.45 to $2.50 per share.In conclusion, we delivered a very solid start to the year. While the underlying macroeconomic environment is choppy, we continue to execute and for the year, expect 14% to 15% revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating margin improvement of more than 100 basis points and 18% to 19% non-GAAP EPS growth. Our confidence reflects our innovative technology portfolio, ongoing design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and the stability and resiliency of our time-based business model. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.See also Ark Invest Stock Portfolio: 15 Biggest Positions and Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

69,2c413181-f55f-3639-a2f8-2808b939b722,MNST,2023-02-17,Monster Beverage (MNST) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monster-beverage-mnst-earnings-expected-150103587.html,1676559663,STORY,['MNST'],"[Monster Beverage (MNST) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy drink maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.59 billion, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Monster Beverage?For Monster Beverage, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Monster Beverage will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Monster Beverage would post earnings of $0.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.60, delivering a surprise of +3.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Monster Beverage doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, Dutch Bros (BROS), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.07 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +250%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $197.73 million, up 41.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Dutch Bros has been revised 4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.70%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dutch Bros will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $768.63 in the previous session. TransDigm Group has gained 22% since the start of the year compared to the 2.4% move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the 8.1% return for the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 7, 2023, TransDigm reported EPS of $4.58 versus consensus estimate of $4.31.For the current fiscal year, TransDigm is expected to post earnings of $22.04 per share on $6.16 billion in revenues. This represents a 28.59% change in EPS on a 13.48% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $26.48 per share on $6.66 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 20.15% and 8.07%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTransDigm may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.TransDigm has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 34.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 21.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 37.8X versus its peer group's average of 16.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.69. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, TransDigm currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if TransDigm fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though TransDigm shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

80,08386804-93b7-37cc-9667-c3f12481d4be,GS,2023-02-17,Why Is Goldman (GS) Up 7.2% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-goldman-gs-7-2-163004613.html,1676565004,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Goldman Sachs (GS). Shares have added about 7.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Goldman due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Goldman Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates as IB Revenues CrashThe Goldman Sachs Group reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $3.32 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.25 by a considerable margin. Also, the bottom line fell significantly from $10.81 in the year-earlier quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $4.80 per share.Goldman’s results were adversely impacted by a slump in the investment banking (IB) business and a decline in asset management revenues. Further, higher provisions were an undermining factor. Yet, the strength in the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC) and consumer banking businesses acted as tailwinds.Net earnings of $1.32 billion plunged 66% from the prior-year quarter.In 2022, earnings of $30.06 per share lagged the consensus estimate of $31.98 and tanked 49% year over year. Our estimate for earnings was $31.54 per share. Net earnings were $11.26 billion, down 48% from the prior year.Revenues Decline, Expenses RiseNet revenues of $10.59 billion fell 16% from the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.52 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $10.29 billion.In 2022, net revenues came in at $47.37 billion, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $47.29 billion. However, the top line declined 20% year over year. Our estimate for total revenues was $47.07 billion.Total operating expenses increased 11% year over year to $8.09 billion.Provision for credit losses was $972 million, higher than $344 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesQuarterly Segment Performance MixedEffective fourth-quarter 2022, Goldman realigned its businesses to further capitalize on its operating model. It has put its businesses into three operating segments — Asset &amp; Wealth Management, Global Banking &amp; Markets, and Platform Solutions.The Asset &amp; Wealth Management division generated revenues of $3.56 billion in the reported quarter, down 27% year over year. Results reflect a significant decline in net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments.Firmwide assets under supervision were $2.55 trillion, up 5% sequentially.The Global Banking &amp; Markets division recorded revenues of $6.52 billion, down 14% year over year. The fall indicated weakness in IB business (down 48%) and lower equities revenues (down 5%), partially offset by impressive net revenues in FICC (up 44%).The Platform Solutions division’s revenues were $513 million, substantially higher year over year. The jump was driven by significantly higher credit card balances and an increase in total deposits.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Dec 31, 2022, the standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.1%, up from the prior-year quarter’s 14.2%. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio was 5.8%, up from 5.6% in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateIn the quarter under review, Goldman returned $2.38 billion of capital to common shareholders. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchases and common stock dividends of $880 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -15% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Goldman has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Goldman has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

81,ade9eaf6-0ad3-30f7-8cd2-b9d1b42ddfb3,GS,2023-02-17,Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-bdc-gsbd-reports-150103969.html,1676559663,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 23, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty finance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.3%.Revenues are expected to be $102.02 million, up 21.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman Sachs BDC?For Goldman Sachs BDC, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Goldman Sachs BDC will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman Sachs BDC would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of +16.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goldman Sachs BDC appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

83,7c37abd6-f77f-32a6-9f2d-950a2205cf76,GPN,2023-02-17,Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.25,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-payments-nyse-gpn-announced-103242515.html,1676629962,STORY,['GPN'],"[Global Payments Inc.'s (NYSE:GPN) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.25 per share on 31st of March. The dividend yield is 0.9% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. See our latest analysis for Global Payments Global Payments' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, Global Payments' dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 18% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.04 total annually to $1.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 38% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Global Payments' EPS has fallen by approximately 33% per year during the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesGlobal Payments' Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, Global Payments has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.02bUS$5.11bUS$5.76bUS$6.22bUS$7.02bUS$7.57bUS$8.03bUS$8.42bUS$8.76bUS$9.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x13Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 7.82%Est @ 6.09%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.04%Est @ 3.45% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$3.6kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$102bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$102b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$35bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$73b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$56.0, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Schlumberger as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.533. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SchlumbergerStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Schlumberger, there are three pertinent items you should consider:Risks: Be aware that  Schlumberger is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for SLB's future outlook?

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit unanimously affirmed a 2021 district court ruling that invalidated a Minerva patent asserted against Hologic. The appellate court ruled that Minerva’s patent is invalid because it waited more than a year to file a patent application after showing a prototype of the invention at a trade show.""We are pleased with the U.S. Court of Appeals decision to invalidate Minerva’s patent. It confirms our belief from the beginning that Minerva’s lawsuit lacked merit,"" said Essex Mitchell, President, Hologic GYN Surgical Solutions Division.In 2017, Minerva alleged that Hologic’s NovaSure® Advanced endometrial ablation system infringed a Minerva patent. In 2021, the district court issued a judgment in Hologic’s favor two weeks before trial, holding that Minerva’s patent is invalid.Today’s affirmation by the U.S. Court of Appeals follows a prior decision against Minerva. In a separate matter between Hologic and Minerva, a Delaware district court found Minerva liable for infringing a Hologic patent. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected Minerva’s arguments on appeal and as a result, Minerva had to pay Hologic more than $7.4 million.About NovaSureThe FDA approved the NovaSure endometrial ablation procedure in 2001 as safe and effective for women who suffer from abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). The procedure provides a minimally invasive treatment option for women seeking an alternative to hormones or hysterectomy to treat their AUB, and since its introduction, more than 3 million women have been treated. The procedure has an efficacy rate of 77.7% and a demonstrated 92.8% patient satisfaction rate at one-year follow-up of the pivotal clinical trial.1About HologicHologic, Inc. is an innovative medical technology company primarily focused on improving women’s health and well-being through early detection and treatment.

The gross margin contracted by a huge 2531 basis points (bps) to 51.8%.Selling, marketing and administrative expenses rose 189.8% to $213.6 million. Research and development expenses went up 146.4% year over year to $64.3 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $277.9 million surged 178.5% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $171.1 million, reflecting a 56.3% decline from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter contracted a huge 4171 bps to 19.7%.Financial PositionQuidelOrtho exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $292.9 million compared with $802.8 million at the end of 2021. Total debt (including short-term debt) at the end of 2022 was $2.64 billion compared with $0.7 million at the end of 2021.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the full-year 2022 was $885.3 million compared with $805.9 million a year ago.GuidanceQuidelOrtho has initiated its financial outlook for the full-year 2023.Total revenues are expected to lie within $2.8 billion-$3.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.77 billion.Total revenue, excluding respiratory sales, is expected to lie within $2.21 billion-$2.25 billion.  At CER, it is likely to register an improvement of 4-6%.Respiratory revenues for the full year are expected to lie within $610 million-$875 million. The respiratory revenues include COVID-related revenue of $300 million-$500 million, rapid flu revenue of $230 million-$270 million and other respiratory revenue of $80 million-$105 million.Adjusted EPS is expected to lie within $5.00-$5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $5.10.Our TakeQuidelOrtho ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. Its robust overall top-line performance was impressive. The company recorded strong revenues in the majority of its business units at CER, excluding COVID-19 revenues. Excluding COVID-19 revenues, geographical results also improved in two regions, which is impressive.Strong Recurring revenues (including reagents, service and other consumables) which were up including and excluding COVID-19 revenues and solid Instrument revenue (driven by strong cash instrument sales in QuidelOrtho’s TM business, including a few nice large wins in North America), were encouraging.Continued strength in QuidelOrtho’s comprehensive product portfolio and expanded global commercial footprint also raise optimism about the stock. The progress made by the company regarding the integration of its QuidelOrtho business is also promising.However, dismal bottom-line results and lower supplemental combined revenues are disappointing. The decline in all its business units and geographies on a reported basis is discouraging. The decline in QuickVue revenues (including COVID-19 revenues) is also worrying. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well. QuidelOrtho continued to face inflation and supply-chain challenges, raising our apprehensions.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuidelOrtho currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

THO, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corp. VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ.5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Inflation Blows Hot AgainThe U.S. equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past few trading sessions as inflationary pressures refused to abate, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than expected in January. The latest data revealed that CPI was up 0.5% in January following a 0.1% rise in December compared to broad-based expectations of a 0.4% increase. This, in turn, signified that inflation was still a force to reckon with and offered further ammunition to the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against it.A few days earlier, Fed had raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they can benefit from ""cash cow"" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. THOR Industries, Inc., CNH Industrial N.V., Valero Energy Corp., Hologic, Inc. and Suzano S.A. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:THOR Industries: Founded in 1980, Indiana-based Thor Industries is the largest manufacturer of RVs in the world.

And here with our key takeaways we've got Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal. Allie, take it away.ALLIE CANAL: Hi, good morning, Brad. And it's been quite the earnings season so far. We will hear from Warner Brothers Discovery at the end of this month. But Netflix, Disney, Comcast, Paramount all painting a very particular picture of the streaming landscape. So my top three takeaways really focuses on this new streaming era. Number one, we've seen mounting streaming losses across the board, which have obviously weighed on these companies' bottom lines.However, management has guided that the end is in sight. You can look at Paramount just out this morning, missed earnings expectations, posted a $1.82 billion DTC loss in 2022. But CEO Bob Bakish did say that there will be a return to earnings growth in 2024 with direct-to-consumer losses peaking this year. Similarly, Disney said Disney+ will be profitable by the end of 2024, with Comcast adding that its Peacock service will also see peak losses in 2023. So there's this improving narrative across the sector.Another theme is more cost cuts and more revenue initiatives. Examples of this include the Netflix password sharing crackdown, the overall slowdown in content spending, price hikes, Paramount announcing on the earnings call just about an hour ago that price hikes will be coming in the third quarter on the heels of that new combo service with Showtime. And then we saw Disney laying off 7,000 employees, restructuring the entire company.And that brings me to point number three-- shifting strategies. What works before might not work now. And there seems to be more of an openness to try new things moving forward. Netflix hinting it will be open to exploring a free ad-supported--]"

Despite a record quarterly user gain for Paramount+, the media giant saw losses from streaming investments escalate there and delivered weak ad revenue for the quarter.RBC Capital Markets media, cable, and telecom analyst Kutgun Maral joins us now. Kutgun, take us into your analysis for Paramount's quarter here.KUTGUN MARAL: Yeah, of course. Thanks for having me. And I think, you know, the quarter itself, while challenged, was broadly in line or solid relative to expectations from Wall Street when you think about direct-to-consumer subscriber growth, revenue trends with-- again, albeit with unsurprising softness in advertising, and profitability. I think for me the biggest concern in the quarter specifically was free cash flow, which was, again, quite challenged and below expectations for a second consecutive quarter and I think will continue to be an area of investor debate.Going back to the earnings call about an hour ago, management talked about the 2023 outlook and highlighted that they were particularly transparent about some of the challenges that they're seeing in terms of the ad market likely to remain pressured until probably the back half of this year and, of course, continued investments in direct to consumer weighing on profitability and free cash flow. So I think there's no question that all traditional media companies are going through a massive transition right now, and some of them are a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of reaching that inflection point in peak losses and going on an improved path towards break even and hopefully profitability.Story continuesIn terms of Paramount, I think maybe they're a year behind in that transition process, but there are clearly a lot of positives to think about when if you have the, I think, patience to look to 2024, especially as a benefit from the price increases that were mentioned earlier as well as the benefits from the combined Paramount+ and Showtime service.ALLIE CANAL: And Kutgun, I want to pick up on those price increases. We have the premium Paramount+ tier with Showtime. That's going to now cost $11.99 up from $9.99. The essential Paramount tier with ads, that will be $5.99 up from $4.99.Now this service, it's always prided itself on being a value player in this space. What are your thoughts on those price changes, especially in relation to competitors? Is it priced correctly?KUTGUN MARAL: We'll have to see. I think the reality is when you combine those two services, you know, you do-- the utility that a consumer gets is far improved. And I think what a lot of these companies are discovering is that when they first came to market-- you know, you go back two, three years ago. Everyone was trying to compete with Netflix and scale aggressively with less of an eye on profitability and the timelines around reaching break even in profitability and clearly a lot bigger focus on subscriber growth. Now, as you pointed out earlier, everyone's tweaking the model, whether it be opportunities on revenue and clearly a lot of optimization on the cost structure.And I do think that the utility that consumers get is relatively high on a lot of these platforms. I know as consumers we might complain about them, but, you know, the investments that these companies have made in terms of the offerings, the original content, the licensing-- licensed content, sports programming, you know, film, I think all these things give management at least a confidence to be able to put through-- push through these price increases and hopefully benefit from increased churn just purely because of the investments that they made on programming and hopefully not see massive churn, as we all expected that they would maybe a year or two ago.JULIE HYMAN: As you say that we've sort of seen a bit of a transform-- a different focus, right, for many of these media companies. I think about a Disney now with a Bob Iger back at the helm, which right now is leaning more into theme parks because that's what's working and really trying to find more discipline on the streaming side of the business. How is that balance, though, working at Paramount, which does not have that juggernaut of a theme-park operation?KUTGUN MARAL: They certainly do not. And from Paramount's perspective, I think their task is really balancing this pivot towards streaming along with the traditional linear assets, which, while in decline, continues to drive a lot of the profitability and, of course, their free cash flow for the company. It's all a matter of making sure that balance towards this growth profile that they hope to scale in and ultimately benefit from from an earnings perspective is disciplined and in a measured way.And I think that's the big challenge, especially as, despite these stocks-- a lot of these media stocks are up 30%, 40%, 50% year to date. I would say that we're kind of in the moment of peak negativity in terms of streaming sentiments, especially for some of these platforms that have not convinced investors that they will be the top three, four player on a global basis in the long run.And so right now, everything that these companies can do is, again, tweak the model to make sure that they're right sizing the top-line opportunity, effectively monetizing the consumer, and certainly improve the cost base. And you're seeing a rationalization in many, many different ways. You know, Bob Iger talked about looking at-- you know, he dropped a lot of bombshells in many ways about rethinking the content investments, rethinking pricing, the markets that they operate in, content exclusivity, content licensing.And when it comes to Paramount, I think it is a profound shift in the way that they operate when they're about to integrate Paramount+ with Showtime, and I think there are-- there might be some concerns about what the immediate subscriber impact of that might be. But the reality of the business is that should drive efficiencies to the tune of $700 million in future annual spend across content spend, tech costs, and marketing. And again, the entire focus right now from a Wall Street perspective is getting to profitability and growing afterwards.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -46.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.92 billion, down 13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont?For Newmont, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +11.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Newmont will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of -6.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

The forward curve is still in contango and if we see some activity from China, rates could pick up quickly,"" he said, referring to when prompt prices fall below forward prices.While there has been some buying activity, overall demand is still considered weak, said Lee Rou Urn, Asia head of LNG pricing at Argus Media.""It will require more of other utilities in northeast Asia to emerge for cargoes in order to provide more support for prices,"" said Lee.In Europe, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily north-west Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in April on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $14.452/mmBtu on Feb. 16, a discount of $1.80/mmBtu to the April gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub, said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG.""Despite renewed buying from Asia, the arbitrage from the U.S. remained closed, with netbacks favouring Europe-bound LNG deliveries from North America.""The European benchmark gas contract fell to a fresh 17-month low as well on Friday on the back of a comfortable supply outlook, and as good storage levels and moderate weather limited demand.Story continues""On the Europe side, fundamentals are also rather weak particularly with the Freeport LNG export facility having loaded its second cargo earlier this week,"" added Argus' Lee.""Underground storages are still much higher now compared to the same period last year, so there is still limited impetus from European buyers to start importing LNG now.""Freeport LNG, the second largest LNG export facility in the U.S., had this week sought permission from federal regulators to restart commercial operations at its long-idled export plant in Texas that was shut due to a fire.The amount of gas flowing from U.S. pipelines to Freeport jumped to its highest since the facility was shut after the company restarted one of the plant's three liquefaction trains, which turns gas into LNG for export.Meanwhile, LNG spot freight rates in the Atlantic rose on a weekly basis for the first time since November as the market stabilises, said Henry Bennett, global head of pricing at Spark Commodities.Atlantic rates edged up on the week to $55,000/day on Friday, while Pacific rates also rose to $69,250/day.

Per Investopedia, “[d]ividend aristocrats are stocks of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.” Several of these enterprises have raised them for far longer, providing confidence for investors.Fundamentally, the most undervalued dividend aristocrats may come in hand this year due to lingering uncertainties. While speculation about a gradual return to normal lift equities for the year so far, questions started to pop up. In particular, a robust labor market implies that the Federal Reserve may still need to raise rates significantly.Plus, we have geopolitical tensions rising throughout the world, sending jitters into the financial system. While the most undervalued dividend aristocrats don’t provide perfect mitigation, they offer significant insulation. Below are seven ideas with analyst support to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAFLAflac$71.01DOVDover$155.70ABBVAbbVie$153.73PNRPentair$56.54GDGeneral Dynamics$232.88EMREmerson Electric$86.91ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.90Aflac (AFL)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAn American insurance company, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) specializes in supplemental insurance. In fact, per its public profile, it’s the largest such provider in the nation. Because of its all-around relevance, AFL performed well. In the trailing year, shares gained 7% of equity value.At the moment, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.4%. To be sure, it’s not the greatest amount among undervalued dividend stocks to buy. For instance, the underlying financial sector’s average yield stands at 3.18%. However, the company commands an impressive 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Plus, its payout ratio sits at 27.78%, providing confidence regarding sustainability.Story continuesObjectively, the market prices AFL at a trailing multiple of 10.64. As a discount to earnings, Aflac ranks better than 57% of its peers. Also, the company enjoys a strong net margin of 21.69%, adding to its overall appeal.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg AFL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target pings at $72.11, implying over 3% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid candidate for most undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Dover (DOV)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comBased in Illinois, Dover (NYSE:DOV) is a conglomerate manufacturer of industrial products. So far this year, DOV delighted stakeholders. Since the January opener, shares popped up over 13%. However, it still has some work to do. In the trailing year, DOV gave up more than 4% of equity value.Be that as it may, DOV makes for an interesting case for undervalued dividend aristocrats, particularly for investors that don’t want to rock the boat. Currently, Dover carries a forward yield of 1.32%, admittedly a low rate of passive income. The industrial sector’s average yield stands at 2.36%. However, Dover commands 67 years of consecutive dividend increases. Furthermore, its payout ratio is subterranean at 20.61%.According to data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices DOV at a trailing multiple of 20.63. As a discount to earnings, Dover ranks better than 51.47% of its competitors. Moreover, the company features above-average stats for revenue growth and net margin. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg DOV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $158.92, implying 3.7% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOne of the largest biopharmaceutical companies, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) generally performed well during the post-coronavirus pandemic new normal. In the trailing year, ABBV gained 7% of equity value (though the price action was choppy). Further, in the trailing five years, shares gained 28%. However, since the January opener, ABBV slipped more than 6%.Still, investors might consider the red ink as an opportunity among undervalued dividend aristocrats. Presently, AbbVie offers a forward yield of 3.89%. Conspicuosly, this ranks much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, AbbVie enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. To note, AbbVie spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013.Objectively, the market prices ABBV at a trailing multiple of 20.3. As a discount to earnings, AbbVie ranks better than 53.54% of the competition. Also, ABBV trades hands at 12.41-times forward earnings, coming in below the sector median of 15.27 times.Right now, analysts peg AbbVie as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $163.50, implying 7.53% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth consideration for undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Pentair (PNR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA water treatment company, Pentair (NYSE:PNR) might not be one of the most well-known examples of undervalued dividend aristocrats. However, its relevance has served the company well recently. In the last six months, PNR gained over 11% of equity value. And since the January opener, shares moved up more than 22%.Like some of the more conservative plays among undervalued dividend aristocrats, Pentair represents a don’t-rock-the-boat type of investment. Presently, its forward yield pings at 1.59%. That’s noticeably lower than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. However, Pentair commands 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Moreover, its payout ratio sits at 21.9%, a very sustainable metric.Financially, the market prices PNR at a trailing multiple of 19.1. As a discount to earnings, Pentair ranks better than 54.12% of its peers. Also, PNR trades hands at 15.5-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 18.87 times. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg Pentair as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $60.50, implying almost 10% upside potential.General Dynamics (GD)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is an aerospace and defense corporation. As of 2020, the company represented the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world by arms sales. Cynically speaking, relevancies associated with geopolitical flashpoints helped boost GD in 2022 while other securities struggled. However, GD dipped over 6% in the year thus far.Nevertheless, contrarians might view this as an opportunity to pick up undervalued dividend aristocrats. Currently, General Dynamics offers a forward yield of 2.16%. This stat just slips below the industrial sector’s average yield. Interestingly, GD represents a relatively new entry among the dividend aristocrats, featuring 26 years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, this circumstance implies that management won’t be too quick to give up this hard-earned status.Objectively, the market prices GD at a trailing multiple of 19.12. As a discount to earnings, General Dynamics ranks better than 70.93% of its rivals. Also, GD trades at 18.38-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 20.79 times. Finally, covering analysts peg the defense contractor as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $272.50, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Emerson Electric (EMR)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased in Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is a multinational corporation that manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial and consumer markets. To be sure, recent developments haven’t been kind to Emerson. In the trailing year, EMR gave up more than 9% of equity value. Since the Jan. opener, shares slipped nearly 11%.Still, for contrarians, EMR could rank among the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Presently, Emerson carries a forward yield of 2.42%. In this case, the yield just pips the underlying sector’s average value. Impressively, the company commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, its payout ratio is manageable at 45.73%.At time of writing, the market prices EMR at a trailing multiple of 10.89. As a discount to earnings, Emerson ranks better than 76.67% of its sector peers. Other than that, the company enjoys a strong profitability metrics. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg EMR as a consensus moderate buy.

Thanks to its unparalleled relevance, ADM performed well in 2022. During the trailing year, ADM gained over 7% of equity value. And in the past five years, shares almost doubled. That said, this year saw ADM slip over 8% so far.Nevertheless, it’s easy to imagine astute investors targeting ADM as one of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 2.19%. That’s a bit higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Moreover, the company features 51 years of consecutive dividend increases and a payout ratio of 26.74%.Right now, the market prices ADM at a trailing multiple of 10.65.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for NRG: mixed.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup CPB, NRG Energy NRG, Global Water Resources GWRS and MGE Energy MGEE.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Hotter-than-Expected Inflation Rattles Wall Street: 5 Safe PicksInflation, regrettably, turned higher to begin 2023. From gas to fuel to shelter, prices have scaled upward and hurt American consumers. The Labor Department noted that the consumer price index (CPI), which primarily encompasses the broader basket of goods and services, increased 0.5% in January and resulted in a year-over-year gain of 6.4%. However, analysts were mostly expecting a month-over-month gain of 0.4% and an annual gain of 6.2%.Most importantly, the core CPI, which eliminates volatile energy and food prices, advanced 0.4% in January and 5.6% compared to a year ago. But market pundits had forecast the core CPI to increase 0.3% monthly and 5.5% from a year ago. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics highlighted that the increase in shelter costs mostly led to an uptick in overall inflation.Shelter costs, which account for more than one-third of the CPI, increased 0.7% in January and were up 7.9% year over year. Energy and food costs were also major contributors. While energy prices were up 2% monthly and 8.7% from a year ago, food costs increased 0.5% monthly and 10.1% annually, added the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Consequently, inflation continues to remain stubbornly higher so far this year, even though it had shown signs of easing in the latter half of last year. But hotter-than-anticipated inflation raised worries about a more aggressive Fed. After all, the central bank officials are bent on taming the rise in prices of indispensable goods and services and henceforth may be bound to remain hawkish.Story continuesAccording to the CME's FedWatch tool, market pundits are now factoring in 74.3% odds of a 25 basis points hike in interest rates in May, as well as in June, thanks to the more-than-expected increase in January's inflation. Anyhow the odds of a further increase in interest rates this year have already increased due to January's blowout employment report. All in all, investors do expect interest rates to increase above 5% and continue to hover at that level until 2024.Unfortunately, rate hikes don't bode well for the economy, which, at the moment, is facing the threat of an imminent recession. Rate hikes impact consumers' spending habits, increase borrowing costs and deter economic growth. Perhaps that's the reason why major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow slipped on Feb 14 after inflation turned higher than projected.But investors shouldn't freak out! On the contrary, they should place their bets on stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns like Conagra Brands, Campbell Soup, NRG Energy, Global Water Resources and MGE Energy.These stocks are part of the consumer staples and utility sectors, or in other words, whose businesses are non-cyclical in nature, making them immune to market vagaries. Additionally, they are dividend players indicating better quality business, which helps them bear market volatility. To top it off, they are low-beta (ranges from 0 to 1) stocks making them less unstable compared to the broader market. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”11. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,021,337,000 Dividend Yield as of February 16: 1.90% Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 51Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company that also provides healthcare services to its consumers.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10. NIKE, Inc.

Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”9.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Masco's shares on or after the 22nd of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.28 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.14 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Masco stock has a trailing yield of around 2.0% on the current share price of $55.81. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Masco If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Masco's payout ratio is modest, at just 31% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 42% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Masco's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 23% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Masco has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpHas Masco got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that Masco is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Masco, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Masco has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Be aware that Masco is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is significant...A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Soaring prices in the wake of the invasion were the trigger for the tax.Despite the deferral of drilling at Kraken, Enquest plans to push ahead with investment at other fields, Magnus and Golden Eagle.The delay at Kraken is not expected to dent Enquest’s output this year, as the drilling was not expected to bring on extra supplies until towards the end of the year.Kraken produced 18,396 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2022.

The forward curve is still in contango and if we see some activity from China, rates could pick up quickly,"" he said, referring to when prompt prices fall below forward prices.While there has been some buying activity, overall demand is still considered weak, said Lee Rou Urn, Asia head of LNG pricing at Argus Media.""It will require more of other utilities in northeast Asia to emerge for cargoes in order to provide more support for prices,"" said Lee.In Europe, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily north-west Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in April on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $14.452/mmBtu on Feb. 16, a discount of $1.80/mmBtu to the April gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub, said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG.""Despite renewed buying from Asia, the arbitrage from the U.S. remained closed, with netbacks favouring Europe-bound LNG deliveries from North America.""The European benchmark gas contract fell to a fresh 17-month low as well on Friday on the back of a comfortable supply outlook, and as good storage levels and moderate weather limited demand.Story continues""On the Europe side, fundamentals are also rather weak particularly with the Freeport LNG export facility having loaded its second cargo earlier this week,"" added Argus' Lee.""Underground storages are still much higher now compared to the same period last year, so there is still limited impetus from European buyers to start importing LNG now.""Freeport LNG, the second largest LNG export facility in the U.S., had this week sought permission from federal regulators to restart commercial operations at its long-idled export plant in Texas that was shut due to a fire.The amount of gas flowing from U.S. pipelines to Freeport jumped to its highest since the facility was shut after the company restarted one of the plant's three liquefaction trains, which turns gas into LNG for export.Meanwhile, LNG spot freight rates in the Atlantic rose on a weekly basis for the first time since November as the market stabilises, said Henry Bennett, global head of pricing at Spark Commodities.Atlantic rates edged up on the week to $55,000/day on Friday, while Pacific rates also rose to $69,250/day.

This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Intuit (INTU) earns a Zacks Rank #3 seven days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 23, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.44 a share.INTU has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.42%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.44 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43.INTU is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure.

In contrast, Russia, India's largest weapons supplier since the Soviet Union days, had a nominal presence. Its state-owned weapons exporter Rosoboronexport had a joint stall with United Aircraft and Almaz-Antey, displaying miniature models of aircraft, trucks, radars and tanks.At previous editions of the show, Rosoboronexport had a more central position for its stall, although Russia has not brought a fighter jet to Bengaluru for a decade after India began considering more European and U.S. fighter jets.Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets have already entered the race to supply fighter jets for the Indian Navy's second aircraft carrier and Lockheed Martin's F-21, an upgraded F-16 designed for India unveiled at Aero India in 2019, are also being offered to the air force.A $20 billion air force proposal to buy 114 multi-role fighter aircraft has been pending for five years, brought into sharp focus by tensions with China and Pakistan.The F-35 is not being considered by India ""as of now"", according to an Indian Air Force (IAF) source, but the display of two F-35s at Aero India for the first time was a sign of New Delhi's growing strategic importance to Washington.It was ""not a sales pitch"" but rather a signal to the importance of the bilateral defence relationship in the Indo-Pacific region, said Angad Singh, an independent defence analyst.Story continues""Even if weapons sales aren't the cornerstone of the relationship, there is a cooperation and collaboration at the military level between India and the U.S.,"" he added.The United States is selective about which countries it allows to buy the F-35. When asked if it would be offered to India, Rear Admiral Michael L. Baker, defence attache at the U.S. embassy in India, said New Delhi was in the ""very early stages"" of considering whether it wanted the plane.An IAF spokeperson did not respond to a request for comment on its interest in F-35s.Ahead of the show, Russian state news agencies reported that Moscow had supplied New Delhi with around $13 billion of arms in the past five years and had placed orders for $10 billion.The United States has approved arms sales worth more than $6 billion to India in the last six years, including transport aircraft, Apache, Chinook and MH-60 helicopters, missiles, air defence systems, naval guns and P-8I Poseidon surveillance aircraft.India also wants to manufacture more defence equipment at home in collaboration with global giants, first to meet its own needs and eventually to export sophisticated weapons platforms.

The one-year-old war has seen both sides expend vast quantities of artillery shells and missiles.Ukraine's high usage rates of ""both precision and unguided munitions have shown NATO countries that any future war would require much higher stocks than anticipated,"" said Roman Schweizer, a defense policy analyst at investment bank Cowen &amp; Co.The attaches said their governments were particularly keen on buying Javelins after seeing the weapon's effectiveness in Ukraine. The missiles have proven deadly against Russian tanks.Five European countries, meanwhile, have expressed interest in buying Raytheon Technologies' precision-guided 155 millimeter artillery rounds, according to a company spokesperson, who declined to name them. The rounds are accurate to within 12 feet (4 meters) and have a range of 20 miles (32 km).Story continuesThe interest from the five countries has not been previously reported. The company already sells to three other European nations.Expressions of interest are the first step in a multi-step acquisition process that includes approval from the United States government and negotiations between the buyer and weapons contractor. It can be a year or more before a weapon is actually delivered.Several of the military attachés, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media on behalf of their governments, said their countries have been making sure payments to defense contractors have been on schedule, hoping to forestall any delays. The weapons purchases are now a domestic policy priority in their countries, they said.U.S. arms makers have in the past complained about late customer payments on calls with investors.DRONES BIG AND SMALLSmall drones and bigger unmanned aircraft, which cost about $20 million each without sophisticated sensors, cameras and other ""extras,"" have also appeared on shopping lists.Finland and Denmark began talks with General Atomics after Russia invaded Ukraine last February, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. They want to buy a small number of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones that can be used for maritime and land surveillance.A Finnish defense ministry spokesperson declined to comment. A Danish defense ministry spokesperson said they have begun the process to buy at least two ""long range, long endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System(s)"" to strengthen ""military capacities in the Arctic,"" without naming any companies.Poland, which has been eager to get its hands on the same model drones, just received two of the previous generation model on lease from General Atomics until they get U.S. approval to buy the new ones, according to two sources familiar with the situation.Defense minister Mariusz Blaszczak confirmed the delivery, although not the number, in a Feb. 12 tweet that said they will be used to surveil the country's eastern border, which it shares with Ukraine and Russian ally Belarus.Some European countries are also keen to begin producing U.S. weapons on their soil because it would reduce dependency on foreign imports and lower purchasing costs.In Germany, arms maker Rheinmetall is ready to boost the output of tank and artillery munitions and may start producing High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) mobile rocket launchers, which have had great success targeting Russian positions, CEO Armin Papperger told Reuters.The system is currently produced by Lockheed Martin Corp in Camden, Arkansas. It is not clear whether the system would be produced under license, a joint venture or some other arrangement.A Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to comment directly on the possibility of Rheinmetall beginning production of HIMARS. Lockheed Martin's Eastern European business development manager for several missile programs, Rita Flaherty, said the company was ""exploring co-production and technology transfer with several international partners.""Latvia, too, is interested in co-producing U.S. munitions. ""We recognize the benefits provided by local production of large caliber munitions,"" military affairs spokesperson Roberts Skraucs said in a statement to Reuters.Expectations remain high that European fears of Russian aggression will still generate orders for the biggest, multibillion dollar U.S. weapons like fighter jets and expensive missile defense systems with sophisticated radar.For more expensive arms, the first orders are expected to be used to backfill equipment sent to Ukraine by Poland. Slovakia, for example, has said it is ready to send its MiG-29 jets to Ukraine. A likely replacement would be Lockheed Martin's F-16, which cost about $65 million each.Investors banking on soaring demand for U.S. weapons have boosted share prices of the biggest U.S. defense contractors – adding $35 billion in market value - since the invasion of Ukraine began.ARTILLERY STILL KEYDemand is particularly high for 155 millimeter artillery shells. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the continued importance of artillery in helping to overwhelm enemy positions or thwart troop advances. The U.S. last year shipped more than 1 million 155 millimeter shells to Ukraine, a standard round that costs the U.S. Army about $800 each.The U.S. production goal for 155 millimeter rounds has tripled from 30,000 shells a month to 90,000 a month over the next two years, according to an Army official. The huge increase reflects the need to restock U.S. supplies as well as those of allies including Norway, Canada, Finland, France, Germany and Italy, who sent some of their stocks to Ukraine.""It has really hit home that this is an industrial-style war,"" said Seth Jones with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, referring to a conflict that requires a high volume of weaponry in a short period of time.Countries also realized early on in the Ukraine conflict the importance of having the Javelin anti-armor missile in their armories, which frequently appeared in news reports of Ukraine's destruction of Russian armored columns.In April, Lithuania said it had set aside 1 billion euros for Javelins and other weapons. In May, Lockheed said it was doubling production and later in the month won, alongside its production partner Raytheon, a $309 million order for more than 1,300 Javelin missiles for Norway, Albania, Latvia as well as to restock U.S. supplies sent to Ukraine. In August, the United States approved a $300 million order for Britain.Training for Javelins is relatively quick, compared to the learning required for more sophisticated platforms like tanks and planes, and the weapons themselves are relatively inexpensive. The medium-range missiles guide themselves after being launched, allowing the shooter to take cover. A single Javelin costs the U.S. Army about $263,000.

The move is the latest in a series of microaggressions that have recently increased tensions between China and the US.The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the sanctions on Feb 16. The designation means that the two American companies are banned from “engaging in import and export activities related to China.” Neither company now sells military products to China, although Raytheon does sell airplane parts to commercial airlines based in the country.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureLockheed Martin said in a statement that it always adheres to US government policy when conducting business with foreign governments, adding that “foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions and we work closely with the US government on any military sales to international customers.”The Chinese government also fined the companies more than double the amount they stand to make from their contracts with Taiwan. It is unclear, however, how China would enforce such a fine.The US has long sold arms to Taiwan. It’s in fact bound by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide the island nation with the means to defend itself. This support for Taiwan has also long irked China, which still claims Taiwan as its own. China announced its intention to sanction US companies back in 2019 as a retaliation for the US ban on Huawei, a Chinese telecom company that the US feared could further enable the Chinese to spy on the US.How many US troops are there around China?🇰🇷 South Korea: US troops have been stationed in South Korea since the 1950s proxy war against the North. There are now 28,500 active service members in the country, spread across 15 military bases.🇯🇵 Japan: There are 56,000 US soldiers based in the island nation, more than any other country in the world. The relationship between Japan and the US military dates back to the end of World War II, when Japan ratified a new constitution that prohibited it from having a military and arranged for the US to manage its national defense, something the current Japanese government is looking to change.Story continues🇹🇼 Taiwan: The US has no official relations with Taiwan, which means the US Armed Forces has no official presence there either. There are, however, 39 unofficial personnel stationed on the island, including 29 Marines, two service members from the Army, three from the Navy, and five from the Air Force.🇵🇭 Philippines: Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced an increase in soldiers posted in the Philippines, hoping to counter Chinese dominance in the region. There are now just 196 active-duty soldiers stationed there. It’s unclear how many will be added.The spy balloon floats over China-US relationsTensions are always high these days between China and the US, but they took a turn for the worse after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina earlier this month. The balloon, which captivated the nation as it floated across the continental US, has become a symbol of China’s increasingly aggressive stance toward relations with the US.Coincidentally, Lockheed Martin manufactured the fighter jet that shot down the balloon in American airspace. The US is planning its own sanctions on any companies that were involved in the making of the balloon.Related stories:🎈The US thinks China has something to do with the balloon spotted over Montana🇨🇳 Companies involved in the making of the Chinese spy balloon could face sanctions📱Apple wants to move its manufacturing out of ChinaMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +8.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.8%. This estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.21 indicates a change of +4.5% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $65.8 billion and $67.74 billion estimates indicate -0.3% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $18.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $7.79 for the same period compares with $7.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.06%. The EPS surprise was +5.13%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”11.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10. NIKE, Inc.

Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”9.

We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

If you want to see more best stocks to buy for investment, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment.While different people have different opinions on what the best stocks for investment are, a decent number of investors think the stocks of leading companies with substantial competitive advantages whose shares are generally less volatile could be good candidates.Less volatile stocks generally don't move as much as the broader stock market does because the future financial performance of less volatile stocks is arguably more predictable. There are certain times where less volatile stocks can be more volatile, however, such as during earnings.Less volatile stocks include leading consumer staples whose demand doesn't change all that much in more challenging economic times. Some less volatile stocks are conglomerates or have multiple leading brands. As a result of having multiple different businesses or multiple different brands, the overall company's results might not change as much as the results of an individual business or individual brand do.Many of the same leading stocks with generally lower betas also have fair growth prospects due to various reasons. For some companies, they might have decent growth potential in faster growing emerging markets such as India. For other companies, they might be repurchasing a lot of their stock. If a company buys back substantial shares and doesn't issue any new shares, its EPS could grow even if its overall earnings stay the same.Although they might have fairly predictable businesses, individual stocks might still underperform if a company makes a bad acquisition, for instance, or if its overall market demand isn't as strong as expected. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.In terms of 2023, many of the leading lower beta stocks have not rallied as much as the market has year to date. In some instances, the lower volatility stocks have declined year to date as individual company earnings have not be as strong as expected. Nevertheless, analysts do expect the leading consumer staples conglomerates mentioned in this article to grow in the long term.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment, we picked 10 stocks that have lower betas than the overall market and that have decent growth potential according to their EPS next 5 Year Ratio.We ranked each of the 10 stocks based on their market capitalization as of 2/15.For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Stocks to Buy for an 18 Year Old.10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment10.

If you want to see more best stocks to buy for an 18 year old, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for an 18 Year Old.The broader stock market has declined substantially in bear markets.During the Great Recession, for example, the S&amp;P 500 declined almost 57% from its peak in 2007.Nevertheless, the market has risen over the long term. The S&amp;P 500 is more than double its 2007 peak for instance.Given they are young, many 18 year olds have the advantage of being long term investors. As a result, they can have longer holding periods.With longer holding periods, the broader market benefits from population growth and productivity growth. With more population, there are more consumers and potentially more demand for products and services. With more productivity growth, more products and services could be produced in total.Over the long term, the broader market also benefits from factors such as companies buying back their stock. If a company buys back its stock and doesn't issue any new ones, a company's EPS could rise even if its earnings stays the same.In terms of the best stocks to buy for an 18 year old, the best stock to buy is probably a popular low cost S&amp;P 500 index fund like SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).Not only is there built-in diversification with SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), but there is also relatively low fees involved.According to the ETF, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) has a gross expense ratio of 0.0945%. In terms of the fund characteristics, the ETF has as of February 14, an estimated 3-5 year EPS growth ratio of 11.86%, a price to cash flow ratio of 14.22, and a price to earnings ratio of 20.72.If the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) isn't an option, the best stocks to buy are arguably quality blue chips with substantial competitive advantages and wide moats.With competitive advantages such as strong brands and substantial scale, the companies could find it easier to maintain or grow their profitability through market cycles than companies with less of a competitive advantage.Story continuesGiven some companies underperform even when they have many competitive advantages, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the stocks to own in the future for an 18 year old, big tech blue chips that trade for fair valuations and that also have potential growth opportunities in AI are potential candidates for investment as well.Photo by Sunrise King on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for an 18 Year Old, we chose 10 stocks with substantial competitive advantages and wide moats.

The Aurora EV-ICD system provides the life-saving benefits of traditional ICDs while avoiding certain risks because its lead (thin wire) is placed outside the heart and veins. The Aurora EV-ICD system is investigational in the United States.Patients implanted with the Aurora EV-ICD system have defibrillation, anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP), and back-up pacing therapies available to them via a single implanted device that is similar in size, shape, and longevity to traditional ICDs. The system approval also includes proprietary procedure implant tools. The Aurora EV-ICD system is expected to be commercially available in autumn 2023 in select countries in Europe.ICDs are highly effective in providing life-saving therapy for patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), an electrical problem with the heart stemming from a dangerously fast heart rate (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). If not treated immediately, SCA can be fatal. Traditional, transvenous ICDs are implanted in the chest and attached to leads that are threaded through the veins into the heart to sense the heart's electrical signals and deliver therapy to terminate a potentially fatal arrhythmia, restoring the heart's normal rhythm.The Aurora EV-ICD is implanted below the left armpit (in the left mid-axillary region) and the Epsila EV lead is placed under the breastbone (sternum) using a minimally invasive approach. Placing the lead outside of the heart and veins is designed to help avoid long-term complications that may be associated with transvenous leads, such as vessel occlusion (narrowing, blockage or compression of a vein) and risks for blood infections.Story continuesCE Mark approval follows the Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (EV ICD) Pivotal Study meeting its safety and effectiveness endpoints;1 data was presented as late breaking science at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2022 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.In the global pivotal study, the device's effectiveness in delivering defibrillation therapy at implant was 98.7%. This reflects a greater defibrillation efficacy for the EV-ICD than historical transvenous ICD studies,122-5 and comparable efficacy to the subcutaneous ICD despite EV-ICD's smaller device size.6 Further, the efficacy of ATP – which paces the heart to interrupt and terminate a dangerous rhythm, potentially avoiding a defibrillation shock – in the EV ICD study was comparable to ATP efficacy in transvenous defibrillators.7,8 In total, 33 shocks were avoided by having ATP programmed ""on.""Additionally, at six months, 92.6% of patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate) in the pivotal study were free from major system and/or procedure-related major complications such as hospitalization, system revision, or death. There were no major intraprocedural complications, nor any unique complications observed related to the EV-ICD procedure or system.""The growing awareness by patients and physicians about the risks that come with placing leads in the heart or veins is addressed by the Aurora EV-ICD system that provides an extravascular solution while maintaining the traditional ICD benefits of pacing and defibrillation therapy,"" said Lucas V.A. Boersma, M.D., Ph.D., cardiologist at St. Antonius Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, and Professor of Cardiology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.The Aurora EV-ICD system includes features available in Medtronic transvenous ICDs, and offers additional advantages that are not available with subcutaneous ICDs including:Anti-tachycardia Pacing (ATP), which terminates ventricular arrhythmias (rapid and/or chaotic activity of the heart that can cause SCA episodes)Pause Prevention Pacing, which provides back-up pacing for brief, intermittent, heartbeat pauses40 Joule Defibrillation Energy, which delivers life-saving shocks in a device the size of transvenous ICDs (33 cc)Medtronic exclusive PhysioCurve™ design, which may offer increased patient comfort and acceptanceUp to 11.7-year projected longevity (a predicted increase compared to the subcutaneous ICD), potentially leading to fewer device replacement procedures during a patient's lifetime""We are proud to be the first company to offer a complete one-system, one-procedure extravascular ICD solution, which maintains the patient benefits of traditional, transvenous ICDs without the risk of leads in the heart and vasculature,"" said Alan Cheng, M.D., chief medical officer of the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""This approval is a significant milestone in achieving our goal of delivering a defibrillation solution that treats sudden cardiac arrest while improving the patient experience.""The Aurora EV-ICD system is indicated for patients who are at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, and who have not had a prior sternotomy and do not need chronic bradycardia (abnormally slow heartbeat) pacing.About MedtronicBold thinking.

Red wolves and Mexican gray wolves were extinct in the wild, and only about 300 gray wolves lived in northern Minnesota and Michigan. Since then, populations of all three species have grown through concerted efforts by government agencies and conservationists.Among those helping to boost these populations are scientists at the Wildlife Science Center in Minnesota. They raise gray wolves and are actively breeding both the red wolf and Mexican gray wolf to help increase numbers in wild populations. These scientists study wolves so they can better understand them - and a small Medtronic device is helping them do so.Learn more about how Medtronic healthcare technology is changing wildlife conservation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739729/Keeping-Up-With-the-Pack]"

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jon.Jon Vander Ark: Thanks Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year, delivering results that exceeded our full year guidance, even in the face of increased volatility in the broader marketplace. During 2022, we achieved revenue growth of 20%, including a 10% from acquisitions; delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 16%; generated adjusted earnings per share of $4.93, which is an 18% increase over the prior year; and produced $1.74 billion of adjusted free cash flow, a 15% increase over the prior year. We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions is the best use of our free cash flow.Story continuesWe invested $2.7 billion in acquisitions in 2022, which includes the acquisition of US Ecology. The integration of US Ecology is going well, with cost synergies tracking ahead of plan. Revenue contribution from US Ecology outperformed our expectations by nearly $50 million for the year, with almost all of the overperformance occurring in the fourth quarter. We continue to adjust prices related to US Ecology and our broader Environmental Solutions business to better align with the capital invested and resources deployed. Pricing actions taken to date have been successful as our customers recognize the high value of service we provide. Additionally, we are building momentum cross-selling our complete set of products and services, with approximately $40 million in new sales to-date.Aside from US Ecology, we invested $500 million in value-creating acquisitions during the year. All of these deals were in the recycling and solid waste space. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Regarding customer zeal, we continue to enhance our culture of delivering a world-class customer experience to win new business and drive customer loyalty. Our customer retention rate remained strong at 94%, and we exited 2022 with our highest NPS scores of the year. We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter, with simultaneous growth in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue increased to 8.4%, and average yield on related revenue increased to 6.7%.This is the highest level of pricing in company history. Organic volume growth was 1.5%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Moving to digital. In early 2022, we implemented the finance and procurement modules of our new ERP system, which streamline back-office activities and provide our local leaders with enhanced data. Currently, we are building our new asset management system, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and drive better warranty recovery. We expect to implement the new asset management system beginning in 2024. We continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. We finished the implementation for all large container and small container routes during 2022 and completed 37% of residential routes by the end of the year.The remaining residential routes are scheduled to be complete by mid-2023. This is a key component enabling further connectivity with our customers, including real-time service notification. The adoption of RISE has helped drive operational efficiencies and cost savings worth approximately $50 million annually. Sustainability is core to our strategy and one of our differentiating capabilities. We believe Republic Services is in a unique position to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth, while making a positive impact on the environment. For example, our polymer centers are advancing circularity of plastics. This is the first time a single US company will manage the plastic stream from current site collection to delivery of high-quality recycled content for consumer packaging.Development of the first center in Las Vegas is on track and is slated to come online in late 2023. Development of our second polymer center is already underway. This facility will be located in the Midwest and will serve as a hub for aggregating and processing recovered plastics in the region. This center should come online in late 2024. The investments we are making to develop these polymer centers is being absorbed through our normal capital expenditure process. Additionally, the development of our renewable natural gas projects is progressing well. All 57 of these projects are being co-developed with partners, with the majority structured as a joint venture. We expect 4 of these projects to come online by mid-2023. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be a workplace where the best people from all backgrounds come to work.Employee engagement improved to a score of 85, with 97% participation. Turnover rates in the fourth quarter improved to the lowest level we've experienced in nearly two years. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the seventh consecutive year. Our 2022 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value and strengthens the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business. Looking forward, we expect to deliver high single-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2023, even with the headwinds from lower recycled commodity prices and higher interest rates.More specifically, we expect 2022 revenues in a range of $14.65 billion to $14.8 billion. This represents high single-digit growth compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $4.275 billion to $4.325 billion. This represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.15 to $5.23 and generate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.9billion. Our acquisition pipeline continues to support outsized levels of activity in both Recycling and Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in2023. Our 2023 financial guidance includes a rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2022.I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year.15 biggest waste management companies in the worldDmitry Kalinovsky/Shutterstock.comBrian DelGhiaccio: Thanks Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core price on related revenue was 8.4%, which included open market pricing of 10.4% and restricted pricing of 5.1%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 11.8%, large container of 8.6%, and residential of 7.8%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9%. Average yield on related revenue was 6.7%, an increase of 40 basis points when compared to our third quarter performance. In 2023, we expect average yield on total revenue of approximately 5.5%. We expect average yield on related revenue of approximately 6.5%. This is an increase of 80 basis points over our full year 2022 results. Fourth quarter volume increased 1.5%.The components of volume included an increase in small container of 1.6%, an increase in large container of 60 basis points, an increase in residential of 1.2% and an increase in landfill of 3.9%. For 2023, we expect organic volume growth in a range of 50 basis points to 1%. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $88 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 180 basis points during the quarter. 2022 full year commodity prices were $170 per ton. This compared to $187 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton. We believe that current commodity prices are temporarily depressed due to a global supply/demand imbalance and that prices will recover in the second half of the year.Accordingly, we are assuming average recycled commodity prices of $125 per ton in 2023, with prices starting at $95 per ton in the first quarter and steadily increasing throughout the year. At $125 per ton, this would result in a decrease in full year 2023 revenue and EBITDA of $45 million when compared to the prior year and a 30 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. In the first quarter of 2023, this would result in a year-on-year decrease of nearly $30 million in revenue and EBITDA and a 70 basis point headwind to EBITDA margin. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Fourth quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased approximately $320 million over the prior year, which primarily related to the acquisition of US Ecology.On a same-store basis, environmental solutions contributed 60 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.3%. This compares to 28.1% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which included 100 basis points related to US Ecology, and an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. These margin headwinds were partially offset by a 20 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in the Recycling and Solid Waste business was 28.7%. This compares to 28.6% margin in the prior year or 10 basis points of margin expansion.Margins improved in the Recycling and Solid Waste business even with an 80 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. Fourth quarter SG&amp;A expenses, excluding transaction costs from US Ecology, were 10.9% of revenue. This included 40 basis points from additional incentive compensation expense due to full year financial outperformance. Full year SG&amp;A expenses were 10.2% of revenue. This was favorable 20 basis points compared to the prior year and reflects continued cost management as we grow the business. In 2023, we expect EBITDA margin to be approximately 29.2%. The 10 basis points of expected margin expansion include a 40 basis point decline related to acquisitions, primarily related to US Ecology, and a 30 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices.These headwinds are more than offset by margin expansion in the underlying business of 80 basis points. While we expect full year expansion compared to the prior year, margins are expected to be down in the first half due to the impact of acquisition rollover and recycled commodity prices. This is most notable in the first quarter where these headwinds impact margin by a combined 210 basis points. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was 10.7% of revenue in 2022 and is expected to be relatively consistent at 10.8% of revenue in 2023. Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $1.74 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business. For 2023, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion or approximately 8% growth at the midpoint.We believe this level of performance is very strong given the expected impact from lower recycled commodity prices, higher interest rates, and higher cash taxes as bonus depreciation begins to unwind. Total debt at the end of the year was $11.9 billion, and total liquidity was $1.7 billion. Floating debt interest rates consistently increased throughout 2022, and we now expect net interest expense of approximately$480 million in 2023. This is an increase of approximately $90 million compared to the prior year. As a reminder, a 1% increase in interest rates results in approximately $33 million of additional interest expense. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was approximately 3.1 times. We expect to revert to three times leverage by mid-2023.With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and non-cash charges from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.1% during the fourth quarter and 25.1% for the full year. This lower than anticipated tax rate resulted in a $0.06 benefit to our full year 2022 EPS. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2023, made up of an adjusted effective tax rate of 20% and approximately $170 million of noncash charges from solar investments. Finally, we expect a majority of the EPS growth in 2023 to be back-end loaded. This results from having the toughest prior year comparisons on recycled commodity prices, interest rates, and taxes during the first half of the year. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.See also 10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks to Invest In and Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks for 2023.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The FDA granted priority review for the sNDA for PREVYMIS for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk (D+/R-); the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, is June 5, 2023. The FDA grants priority review to medicines and vaccines that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment or prevention of a serious condition. A second sNDA to extend use of PREVYMIS from 100 days to 200 days in adults receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) who are at risk for late CMV infection and disease was also accepted for review, with a PDUFA date of Sept. 7, 2023.""Certain high-risk individuals who develop CMV infection following receipt of a kidney transplant are at increased risk for transplant failure and death. PREVYMIS has the potential to be an important new option with a favorable safety profile for patients at risk for CMV infection following a kidney transplant,"" said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president, vaccines and infectious diseases, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to the FDA’s review of our filings for PREVYMIS.""PREVYMIS is a first-in-class antiviral agent that was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2017 and is indicated for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).Data supporting the sNDA for CMV prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipientsThe sNDA for use of PREVYMIS for CMV prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipients is supported by a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial (NCT03443869) that demonstrated non-inferior efficacy and a more favorable safety profile for PREVYMIS compared to valganciclovir, the current standard of care for CMV prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipients. Data from the trial were presented during a late-breaking oral session at the IDWeek Annual Meeting in October 2022.Story continuesKey safety resultsIn the study, PREVYMIS had a more favorable safety profile compared to valganciclovir, with fewer drug-related adverse events (AEs) and study drug discontinuations due to adverse events reported in the PREVYMIS group compared to the valganciclovir group. The incidence of leukopenia (decrease in leukocytes, or white blood cells) and neutropenia (decrease in neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell) was lower with PREVYMIS than with valganciclovir:The treatment difference in leukopenia/neutropenia was 38% lower in the PREVYMIS group versus the valganciclovir group and was statistically significant (95% CI, -45.1, -30.3; p value = &lt;0.0001);Neutropenia measured during treatment through week 28 post-transplant (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/µL) was reported in 4.1% (n=12) of the PREVYMIS group versus 19.5% (n=58) of the valganciclovir group (95% CI, -20.7, -10.5);Leukopenia and neutropenia leading to discontinuation of study drug during the 28-week treatment phase was reported in 1.0% (n=3) in the PREVYMIS group and 5.4% (n=16) in the valganciclovir group, and 1.4% (n=4) in the PREVYMIS group and 1.7% (n=5) in the valganciclovir group, respectively.Additional safety information from the trial:Drug-related AEs were reported in 19.9% (n=58) of PREVYMIS participants and 35.0% (n=104) of valganciclovir participants through week 28 post kidney transplant (95% CI, −22.2, −8.0). Serious drug-related AEs were reported in 1.4% (n=4) of PREVYMIS participants and 5.1% (n=15) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI, −7.0, −0.9);Discontinuations due to an AE: 4.1% (n=12) in the PREVYMIS group and 13.5% (n=40) in the valganciclovir group (95% CI −14.1, −4.9);Discontinuation due to a serious AE: 2.1% (n=6) of PREVYMIS participants versus 4.7% (n=14) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI −5.9, 0.3);Discontinuation due to a drug-related AE: 2.7% (n=8) of PREVYMIS participants versus 8.8% (n=26) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI −10.1, −2.4);Discontinuation due to serious drug-related AE: 0.7% (n=2) of PREVYMIS participants versus 2.4% (n=7) of valganciclovir participants (95% CI −4.2, 0.4);Two participants (0.7%) in the PREVYMIS group and one participant in the valganciclovir group (0.3%) died (95% CI, −1.3, 2.2).Data supporting the sNDA for 200 days of prophylaxis in HSCT patientsThe sNDA for 200 days of prophylaxis with PREVYMIS is supported by a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03930615) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of extending prophylaxis with PREVYMIS from 100 to 200 days, compared to placebo, in CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] at high risk for clinically significant CMV infection following an HSCT. This trial met its primary endpoint and prophylaxis with PREVYMIS extended to 200 days was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of clinically significant CMV infection from Week 14 through Week 28 post-HSCT in allogeneic R+ HSCT recipients. PREVYMIS had an adverse event profile similar to placebo and was well-tolerated. These data will be presented on Saturday, Feb. 18, at the 2023 Tandem Meetings / Transplantation &amp; Cellular Therapy Meetings of ASTCT™ (American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy) and CIBMTR® (Center for International Blood &amp; Marrow Transplant Research).About PREVYMIS (letermovir)PREVYMIS is the only drug approved in the United States for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adults who are CMV-seropositive and have received an allogeneic HSCT. PREVYMIS is also approved in more than 60 countries outside of the United States, including EU member states, Canada, Japan and China. PREVYMIS is a first-in-class non-nucleoside CMV inhibitor (3,4 dihydro-quinazolines) and inhibits viral replication by specifically targeting the viral terminase complex. Cross resistance is not likely with drugs outside of this class. PREVYMIS is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors. These DNA polymerase inhibitors are fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to PREVYMIS. PREVYMIS has no activity against other viruses.Selected Safety Information about PREVYMIS (letermovir)PREVYMIS is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids. Increased pimozide concentrations may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Increased ergot alkaloids concentrations may lead to ergotism. PREVYMIS is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when co-administered with cyclosporine. Significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.The concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug.The rate of adverse events in the first 100 days following HSCT occurring in at least 10% of transplant recipients treated with PREVYMIS and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo were nausea (27% vs 23%), diarrhea (26% vs 24%), vomiting (19% vs 14%), peripheral edema (14% vs 9%), cough (14% vs 10%), headache (14% vs 9%), fatigue (13% vs 11%), and abdominal pain (12% vs 9%).Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one subject following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS, leading to treatment discontinuation.If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily.Co-administration of PREVYMIS may alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PREVYMIS. Consult the full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions.Closely monitor serum creatinine levels in patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min using PREVYMIS injection.PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.The safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS in patients below 18 years of age have not been established.For patients with CLcr greater than 10 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation), no dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on renal impairment. The safety of PREVYMIS in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 10 mL/min), including patients on dialysis, is unknown.About CMVCMV is a common virus that infects people of all ages. Many adults in the United States are CMV-seropositive, meaning they have CMV antibodies in their blood, indicating a previous exposure to or primary infection with CMV. People with normal immune systems rarely develop CMV symptoms after initial infection, with the virus typically remaining inactive or latent in the body for life. A weakened immune system may give the virus a chance to reactivate, potentially leading to symptomatic disease or a secondary infection due to other pathogens. When a transplant recipient who is CMV-seronegative receives an organ from a donor who is CMV seropositive, the transplant recipient can get CMV from the donated organ. CMV disease can lead to end-organ damage, including gastrointestinal tract disease, pneumonia or retinitis. Transplant recipients who develop CMV infection post-transplant are at increased risk for transplant failure and death. CMV prophylaxis with certain existing antivirals has been associated with drug-specific effects, including myelosuppression and renal toxicity, in HSCT recipients.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

After a median follow-up of 31.0 months (range, 15.3-46.3 months), KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival (OS), reducing the risk of death by 22% (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.70-0.87]; p&lt;0.0001) compared to chemotherapy alone for these patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression. Median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.9-14.0) for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy versus 11.5 months (95% CI, 10.6-12.1) for chemotherapy alone. These data are being presented today during a European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Plenary and are being submitted to regulatory authorities worldwide.""Most gastric cancers go undetected until an advanced stage, at which point the five-year survival rate is just 6%, one of the lowest across cancer types,"" said Dr. Sun Young Rha, director and professor of medical oncology in the Department of Internal Medicine, Songdang Institute for Cancer Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea. ""The positive overall survival results observed in this study are very encouraging and demonstrate the potential of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy to extend the lives of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.""Story continuesResults from the KEYNOTE-859 trial were generally consistent across pre-specified subgroups. In addition to an improvement in OS, results showed KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), which were both secondary endpoints of the trial, versus chemotherapy alone. Specifically, KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 24% (HR=0.76 [95% CI, 0.67-0.85]; p&lt;0.0001) with a median PFS of 6.9 months (95% CI, 6.3-7.2) for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy compared to 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.5-5.7) for chemotherapy alone. The ORR was 51.3% (95% CI, 47.7-54.8), with a complete response (CR) rate of 9.5% and a partial response (PR) rate of 41.8%, for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy and 42.0% (95% CI, 38.5-45.5), with a CR rate of 6.2% and a PR rate of 35.7%, for those who received chemotherapy alone (p=0.00009). Median duration of response (DOR), another secondary endpoint of the trial, was 8.0 months (range, 1.2+-41.5+) for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy versus 5.7 months (range, 1.3+-34.7+) for chemotherapy alone.""Eighty percent of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma have HER2-negative disease. Based on these new data, we hope to expand the use of KEYTRUDA and provide an option that, in combination with chemotherapy, may help more of these patients live longer,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These results also reinforce our commitment to research in gastrointestinal cancers, where we continue to evaluate a number of KEYTRUDA-based combinations, including in earlier stages of disease.""Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 59.4% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy and 51.1% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone; TRAEs led to death in eight (1.0%) versus 16 (2.0%) patients, respectively. No new safety signals were identified. Grade 3-5 immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) occurred in 7.9% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy and 1.7% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone; immune-mediated AEs led to death in one patient (0.1%) in each of the treatment arms.KEYTRUDA is approved in the U.S. in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers, which includes KEYNOTE-811 in first-line advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer, KEYNOTE-585 in early-stage gastric cancer and further exploration in advanced/metastatic gastric cancer in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in LEAP-015. Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic, colorectal and biliary tract cancers.About KEYNOTE-859KEYNOTE-859 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03675737) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint is OS, and secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, DOR and safety. The trial enrolled 1,579 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately two years) in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy (n=785), or placebo in combination with chemotherapy (n=787). All patients received investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (5-FU plus cisplatin [FP] or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin [CAPOX]).About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90-95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). The majority of gastric cancers are HER2-negative, affecting approximately four out of every five patients. Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 26,500 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 11,000 deaths from the disease in 2023. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients.

Median OS was 42.1 months for the LYNPARZA plus abi/pred arm versus 34.7 months for the placebo plus abi/pred arm, representing a 7.4-month absolute difference in median OS versus a standard of care (at 47.9% maturity, HR=0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-1.00]; p=0.0544). This OS trend did not reach statistical significance.Results from the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), which showed that LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 34% compared to placebo plus abi/pred (median rPFS 24.8 months versus 16.6 months, respectively, HR=0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.81]; p&lt;0.0001), were previously presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium and published in NEJM Evidence.The final OS results from PROpel will be presented today at ASCO GU 2023 (abstract LBA16).In this updated analysis, the most common adverse events (AEs) (≥20%) were anemia (49.7%), fatigue (38.7%), nausea (30.7%), back pain (21.6%) and diarrhea (20.6%). Grade ≥3 AEs were anemia (16.1%), hypertension (3.8%), urinary tract infection (2.5%), fatigue (2.5%), vomiting (1.5%), diarrhea (1.3%), decreased appetite (1%), back pain (1%) and nausea (0.3%). Approximately 17% of patients who received LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred discontinued treatment due to an AE.Noel Clarke, urological surgeon and professor of urological oncology at Manchester’s Christie/Salford Royal Hospitals and Manchester University, and a senior investigator in the PROpel trial, said, ""From the primary radiographic progression-free survival analysis presented at ASCO GU last year to the updated overall survival data presented today, the data reinforce the therapeutic potential of olaparib plus abiraterone and prednisone for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in the overall trial population and across subgroups. The results of PROpel are important for patients and the oncology community alike, providing support for this combination as a potential and critically needed new treatment option in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.""Story continuesSusan Galbraith, executive vice president, oncology R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said, ""Both PARP, the target of LYNPARZA, and the androgen receptor are important for providing DNA repair in prostate cancer. The results in the overall trial population from PROpel illustrate how the combination of LYNPARZA and abiraterone can exploit the dependency of the androgen receptor’s role in DNA repair on PARP to provide greater anticancer activity than abiraterone alone. Based on the totality of the data, it is notable to see this combination delivering a meaningful benefit in a broad population of patients in this setting, which is further underscored by the recent indication approved in the European Union.""Dr Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in patients assigned male at birth, and mortality is estimated to almost double over the next 20 years. With limited treatment options for these patients, we recognize the critical need for therapies that can delay disease progression. We are proud of our collaboration with AstraZeneca, as we work together to advance pending regulatory reviews and bring a new treatment option to the prostate cancer community.""Summary of final results of key secondary OS endpoint across subgroupsLYNPARZA + abi/predPlacebo + abi/predIntention-to-Treat (ITT)Number of patients (n)399397Median OS in months42.134.7HR (95% CI)0.81 (0.67, 1.00)Homologous recombination repair-mutated (HRRm)Number of patients (n)111115Median OS in monthsNR28.5HR (95% CI)0.66 (0.45, 0.95)Non-HRRmNumber of patients (n)279273Median OS in months42.138.9HR (95% CI)0.89 (0.70, 1.14)BRCAmNumber of patients (n)4738Median OS in monthsNR23.0HR (95% CI)0.29 (0.14, 0.56)Non-BRCAmNumber of patients (n)343350Median OS in months39.638.0HR (95% CI)0.91 (0.73, 1.13)*18 patients with unknown HRRm status were excluded from subgroup analysis. NR, not reached.LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred was approved by the European Commission in December 2022 for the treatment of mCRPC in adult men for whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated and is currently undergoing regulatory review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for this indication.LYNPARZA is currently approved in the U.S. for patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone, based on the Phase 3 PROfound trial. For this indication, patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.About PROpelPROpel is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or new hormonal agents in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was rPFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. OS was an additional efficacy outcome measure.About prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men globally, with an estimated 1.4 million cases and 375,000 deaths in 2020. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer have a particularly poor prognosis, with a five-year relative survival rate of about 30%, compared to patients diagnosed with earlier stages of the disease, with a five-year relative survival rate of more than 99%.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. VTE occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab and at a ≥5% frequency compared to placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%), and leukopenia (18%).

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. As part of our focus on cancer, Merck is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the largest development programs in the industry across more than 30 tumor types.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher's accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets.

Inc. to support natural gas development in the prolific Haynesville Basin as well as the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Williams will provide natural gas gathering services to Chevron’s 26,000-acre Haynesville dedication while Chevron has agreed to a long-term capacity commitment on Williams’ Louisiana Energy Gateway (LEG) project. Additionally, Williams has agreed to use existing infrastructure to serve increased production from the Blind Faith platform, located 160 miles southeast of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico.""This is a great example of Williams and Chevron working together to accelerate the development and delivery of natural gas to supply affordable, reliable, ever cleaner energy both here in the United States and overseas,"" said Alan Armstrong, president and CEO of Williams. ""We are proud to take another step in advancing the output potential of two of the most prolific production areas in North America.""As part of the Haynesville agreement, Williams plans to construct a greenfield gathering system in support of Chevron’s acreage dedication with connectivity to Williams LEG project. The LEG project is designed to gather natural gas produced in the Haynesville basin for delivery to premium markets, including Transco, industrial markets, and growing LNG export demand along the Gulf Coast. LEG, which is expected to go into service in 2024, is a key component of Williams’ lower carbon, wellhead to water strategy, proving up what an important role natural gas can play in reducing emissions, lowering costs, and providing secure and reliable energy at home and around the world. LEG is ideally positioned to incorporate carbon capture and storage as a further decarbonizing solution for natural gas production in the rapidly growing Haynesville basin.In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Chevron is developing the Ballymore tieback to the Blind Faith platform. The project, which involves three production wells tied back via one flowline to the nearby Blind Faith facility, has a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Using existing connections to Blind Faith, Williams will provide offshore natural gas gathering and crude oil transportation services as well as onshore natural gas processing services for the production. Chevron is the operator of the Ballymore project with a 60 percent working interest. Co-owner TotalEnergies E&amp;P USA, Inc. has a 40 percent working interest.Story continuesAbout WilliamsAs the world demands reliable, low-cost, low-carbon energy, Williams (NYSE: WMB) will be there with the best transport, storage and delivery solutions to reliably fuel the clean energy economy.

(The) (WMB). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Evergy Inc and Williams Companies, Inc. (The) are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that EVRG has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.EVRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.80, while WMB has a forward P/E of 17.82. We also note that EVRG has a PEG ratio of 3.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. WMB currently has a PEG ratio of 5.09.Another notable valuation metric for EVRG is its P/B ratio of 1.46. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WMB has a P/B of 2.82.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help EVRG earn a Value grade of B, while WMB has been given a Value grade of C.EVRG sticks out from WMB in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that EVRG is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

168,c99709dd-b6a5-37ab-99e9-984d55e383ca,WMB,2023-02-17,Pembina Pipeline (PBA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pembina-pipeline-pba-reports-next-150103182.html,1676559663,STORY,"['PPL.TO', 'PBA', 'WMB']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Pembina Pipeline (PBA) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 23, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas transportation and services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +766.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.46 billion, down 27.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pembina Pipeline?For Pembina Pipeline, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.23%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pembina Pipeline will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pembina Pipeline would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.27, delivering a surprise of +164.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pembina Pipeline doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.47 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +20.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.18 billion, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Williams Companies, Inc. (The) has been revised 2.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.07%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Williams Companies, Inc. (The) will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

169,95945fcc-ee0c-391d-9c77-c417268f3166,BA,2023-02-17,Are Investors Undervaluing The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) By 40%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-boeing-company-nyse-130018268.html,1676638818,STORY,['BA'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.29bUS$7.56bUS$9.92bUS$10.4bUS$12.0bUS$13.3bUS$14.3bUS$15.1bUS$15.9bUS$16.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x3Est @ 10.16%Est @ 7.73%Est @ 6.03%Est @ 4.84%Est @ 4.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$4.0kUS$6.5kUS$7.9kUS$7.7kUS$8.2kUS$8.4kUS$8.4kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$75bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$17b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.1%) = US$292bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$292b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$137bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$212b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$212, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boeing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.973. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for BoeingStrengthNo major strengths identified for BA.WeaknessShareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Boeing, we've put together three important factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Boeing (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does BA's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to see more most profitable Robinhood stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks.Robinhood is a brokerage firm that helped lower the cost of commissions for buying stocks.Because Robinhood didn't charge any commissions for buying stocks on its brokerage, several major brokerages also lowered their commissions as a result for buying stocks.As a result, many consumers have saved money in terms of commissions due to Robinhood's business model. Instead of making money on commissions, Robinhood tries to make money on other things such as margin interest.Previously, Robinhood published an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. According to the company's Q4 results, the company had 11.4 million monthly active users.Some stocks held by Robinhood users are lower quality stocks that I would stay away from.On the other hand, some popular stocks in Robinhood include some dominant blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable. Among the blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable are, in fact, some of America's most profitable companies by net income in 2022.In terms of 2023, the profits of many companies will depend on how the U.S. economy and the world economy does.In terms of how the U.S. economy does, how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further could affect U.S. economic growth in 2023. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession which could lead to earnings decreasing for many companies.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's policy depends on decision makers and also economic data.In terms of the latest economic data on inflation, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% for the month of January, which translates to an annual rise of 6.4%. The rise in the month was a little higher than economist estimates of an increase of 0.4% on the month and 6.2% on the year.Story continuesGiven the market could decline if economic data fails to meet expectations, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.FacebookPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks, we took the stocks listed on 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood and ranked them based on net income according to YCharts.We replaced The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) with Walmart Inc.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”11.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10. NIKE, Inc.

Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”9.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

Following concluding remarks from Pablo, we will hold a Q&amp;A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Pablo.Story continuesPablo Legorreta: Thank you, George and welcome to everyone on the call. I am delighted to report another year of strong execution on our strategy as a leading funder of Innovation and Life Sciences. Slide 6 summarizes our financial and portfolio achievements in 2022 which underscore our strong momentum and the power of our business model. First, we delivered a strong financial performance. Adjusted cash receipts, our top line grew by 10%, adjusted EBITDA by 10% and adjusted cash flow by 15% which are all prior to an accelerated Biohaven redemption payments were received in the quarter which I will discuss on the next slide. Our reported growth, of course, was significantly higher as a result of this Biohaven payment. Second, we strengthened our Royalty portfolio.We added 6 new therapies, including the blockbuster Trelegy and we expanded our development stage pipeline through the acquisition of several attractive therapies such as Cytokinetics, aficamten and Amgen's olpasiran. We also entered into a novel R&amp;D funding collaboration with Merck which could form the blueprint for future deals with large biopharma. Meanwhile, Pfizer's acquisition of Biohaven resulted in accelerated value creation to Royalty Pharma. Third, we had another strong year of capital deployment. Building off of the momentum since our IPO, we announced up to $3.5 billion in transactions, maintaining our leading share of the royalty funding market. And given the rapid expanding opportunity set at our Investor Day last May, we raised our capital deployment goal to $10 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years.On Slide 7, you can see our financials in a little more detail. We received an accelerated Biohaven redemption payment resulting from Pfizer's acquisition of Biohaven which benefited adjusted cash receipts by $458 million. Prior to this payment, as just mentioned, we delivered 12% growth in our top line in the quarter and 10% for the full year. Foreign exchange continued to represent a headwind impacting our top line by around 5% for the quarter and 3% to 4% for the full year. Including the Biohaven payment, our top line nearly doubled in the quarter. Consistent with our top line, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 13% in the quarter and by 10% for the full year prior to the Biohaven payment. Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP measure for us which is arrived at by deducting payments for operating and professional costs from our top line.Lastly, our adjusted cash flow, our bottom line, grew by 35% in the quarter and by 15% for the full year prior to the Biohaven payment. The substantial increase in our fourth quarter partially reflected lower upfront development stage payments when compared to the prior period. Slide 8 shows our impressive track record of strong top line growth since our IPO in June 2020. This reflects our ability to execute successfully against our strategy. Slide 9 digs deeper into our top line performance in 2022 to show the various moving parts. Royalty expiries and foreign exchange represented a significant headwind to our growth in 2022. Despite this, the strong performance of our base business and the acquisition of Trelegy royalties, allowed us to deliver approximately 10% top line growth before taking into account the accelerated Biohaven payment.We have absorbed significant losses of exclusivity over the past 2 years and still delivered top line growth in the double digits. This speaks to the unique power of our business model to replenish the portfolio and to drive compounding growth. My final slides expand on this critical point. Slide 10 shows that since 2020, we have announced approximately $10 billion in transactions across close to 20 deals and acquired Royalty interest in some of the most transformative therapies in the industry. Roughly 70% of our capital deployed since 2020 has been on approved therapies and 30% on development stage products. These new royalties already account for around 10% of our adjusted cash receipts by 2025. They are expected to add around $1 billion to our top line.Put simply, we have replenished a significant portion of our business over a 5-year period and at the same time, sustained double-digit growth. Very few companies in the life sciences industry have the ability to do this. With that, I will hand it over to Chris to update you on our transaction pipeline.Christopher Hite: Thanks, Pablo. Let's move to Slide 12. The strong momentum in our business is underpinned by encouraging trends in the royalty market as well as the fact that royalties are becoming a mainstream tool to fund innovation. Between 2015 and 2022, the number of royalty funding transactions increased more than sixfold to 27 deals while the dollar value of transactions rose tenfold to $6.2 billion. Over that period, Royalty Pharma has maintained the leading share of the royalty market. In 2022, we accounted for more than $0.5 value of transactions and over 1/4 of transaction volume and we remain the clear leader in larger transactions. Slide 13 details the funnel of opportunities we saw in 2022. We reviewed more than 350 potential transactions.This resulted in a 106 confidentiality agreements signed, 70 in-depth reviews and 38 proposals submitted. Our disciplined and highly selective approach resulted in us executing 9 transactions across 6 new therapies were just 3% of our initial reviews. This is consistent with our historical average in the low single-digit percentage range and reflects the exceptionally high bar we apply to royalty funding opportunities. Slide 14 shows the growth in our pipeline opportunity set. Between 2019 and 2022, we saw a 75% increase in initial reviews and in-depth reviews and the value of the transactions we executed on increased by 58%. Clearly, the difficult equity market for biotechs in 2022 helped us. However, we have seen positive market trends for a number of years as royalty funding has become an increasingly mainstream funding modality.This supports our confidence in meeting our raised 5-year capital deployment target that Pablo mentioned. And with that, I will hand it over to Marshall.Marshall Urist: Thanks, Chris. On the next few slides, I want to discuss 2 recent transactions that brought us 2 exciting opportunities in the lipoprotein A or LP(a) class of cardiovascular medicines. Last month, we were pleased to announce a win-win partnership with Ionis. We acquired royalties on Spinraza, a blockbuster for spinal muscular atrophy and pelacarsen, an exciting development stage Lp(a) therapy for cardiovascular disease. Through this collaboration, we deployed $500 million upfront and committed up to $625 million in potential milestones. The unique deal structure provides an attractive risk reward for Royalty Pharma. Our interest in SPINRAZA, a blockbuster medicine approved in more than 60 countries with 2022 sales of $1.8 billion supports the investment with a lower risk royalty.However, the really exciting part of the deal is the significant upside potential from pelacarsen which Novartis has projected to have greater than $3 billion in peak sales potential. Pelacarsen is the most advanced of the 2 leading clinical stage compounds in the Lp(a) class with Phase III cardiovascular outcomes data expected in 2025. On Slide 17, I want to highlight that we also acquired royalties to the other exciting investigational therapy in the Lp(a) class, Amgen's olpasiran. We acquired this royalty from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals in November 2022 in exchange for a $250 million upfront payment and potential milestones of up to $160 million. The Phase II clinical data on olpasiran is very encouraging. And as with pelacarsen, a Phase III outcome study is underway and this study is expected to complete in late 2026.Consensus expectations are that this new class of cardiovascular therapies will generate more than $4 billion of sales by the early part of the next decade and there are many reasons to believe that these estimates could prove conservative. Slide 18 returns to our concept from our Investor Day last May. From a strategic perspective, the LP(a) class exhibits 2 of our key investment themes. The first one is the idea of under-innovated large markets. The shift towards specialty markets over the last decade with smaller patient population and higher price points has meant that some of the incredible innovation that we've seen has not been applied to the same extent in some of the larger markets that are higher volume but that still have significant unmet patient need.Cardiology is a great example of this and the Lp(a) class has transformative potential. In addition, we have seen that targeted therapies can drive significant patient benefit in cancer. However, there has been comparatively less development of targeted therapies in therapeutic areas outside of oncology. So this is another theme that we're excited about. We think there's significant potential for patients to benefit from targeted therapies in areas such as cardiology given the increased understanding of mechanistic drivers of disease, our Cytokinetics partnership is a good example as well. So why does Royalty Pharma believe in the transformative potential and in the multi-blockbuster opportunity for this class? First, Lp(a) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, supported by extensive data from genetic studies among other sources of evidence.Medicine, Health, PharmacyPhoto by freestocks on UnsplashSecond, there is a huge unmet need. Over 8 million people worldwide have elevated Lp(a) in cardiovascular disease and these people face a more than twofold increased risk of cardiovascular events. Importantly, Lp(a) cannot be addressed by dietary modification or approved lipid-lowering drugs. Third, both pelacarsen and olpasiran have been shown in Phase II studies to produce robust reductions in Lp(a) with encouraging safety profile. And lastly, there are 2 well-designed outcome studies enrolling more than 14,000 people which are expected to read out around the middle of the decade, supported by 2 of the strongest cardiovascular medicine companies in Amgen and Novartis. Taken together, we believe that Lp(a) reduction could represent one of the next major frontiers in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and be a potentially important growth driver for Royalty Pharma towards the end of this decade and beyond 2030.On the next slide, I want to highlight Royalty Pharma's unique ability to invest in multiple products in a given therapeutic area. We have historically demonstrated this in multiple sclerosis, prostate cancer, migraine and in the anti-TNF category. As a result of our Arrowhead and Ionis deals, we now have royalties on 2 important medicines for spinal muscular atrophy as well as 2 leading investigational Lp(a) therapies. This unique ability to invest in multiple products in the most innovative therapeutic classes is clearly a differentiating feature of our business model. Moving to Slide 21. AstraZeneca's Airsupra, formerly PT027, was just approved by the FDA last month for the treatment of asthma. This is a first-in-class fixed-dose combination therapy that treats both the symptoms and underlying inflammation of asthma.This is another example of how our development stage portfolio can make important contributions to our business. We're entitled to a low single-digit tiered royalty on annual U.S. net sales success-based milestones and other potential payments. The market size is significant. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 25 million asthma patients and 71 million rescue inhalers used annually. The consensus currently projects Airsupra to approach $1 billion in sales by 2030. On Slide 22, if we look at the early performance of our transaction since 2020, the picture is encouraging. For the approved therapies we recently acquired, the majority have seen increases to street consensus sales forecast since the acquisition date with several increasing by more than 40%.Although we, of course, invest based on internal forecasts and we do not necessarily need products to outperform the consensus in order to achieve our return targets. Nevertheless, this way of assessing the recent additions to our approved product portfolio is a directionally useful indicator to show that our bar for quality remains high. One disappointment within our approved product investments has been Gavreto, a therapy which we and Roche fully impaired based on the updated commercial outlook for the product. For the development-stage therapies, we have seen some important progress such as the approvals of and positive data readouts for zavegepant and Tremfya. However, otilimab and gantenerumab development has been discontinued, although we remain enthusiastic about the overall MorphoSys transaction given the significant outperformance from Tremfya.Lastly, we're excited for several important upcoming events in 2023 from these recent deals, including the potential approval of intranasal zavegepant, Phase III data from oral zavegepant and migraine prevention, aficamten in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Tremfya in ulcerative colitis and chronic disease. With that, I'll hand it over to Terry.Terry Coyne: Thanks, Marshall. Let's move to Slide 24. Total royalty receipts grew 79% in the fourth quarter and 24% for full year 2022 versus the respective year-ago periods. Excluding the accelerated Biohaven payment, royalty receipts grew 7% for Q4 and 5% for full year. The magnitude of growth in the fourth quarter reflects the accelerated Biohaven payment together with strong contributions from cystic fibrosis franchise, Xtandi, Tremfya and the Trelegy royalty which we acquired in July. We also saw growing royalty contributions from Cabometyx and from several medicines not shown on this slide, particularly Evrysdi, Trodelvy and Orladeyo. These positive factors were partially offset by the loss of the DPP-IV royalties by weakness in Imbruvica and, to a lesser extent, Tysabri and by the adverse FX impact.Full year growth was also partially offset by a decline in royalty receipts from the HIV franchise which reached the end of its royalty term in 2021. Slide 25 shows how our efficient business model generates substantial cash flow to be redeployed. As you're aware, adjusted cash receipt is a key non-GAAP metric for us which we arrived at after deducting distributions to non-controlling interests. This amounted to $1.1 billion in the quarter or growth of 96% compared with last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted cash receipts were up $2.8 billion, up 31%. As Pablo noted earlier, prior to the impact of the accelerated Biohaven payment, growth would have been approximately 12% in the quarter and 10% for the full year. As we move down the column, operating and professional costs were approximately 8% of adjusted cash receipts in the fourth quarter and for the full year.As a consequence, we reported 99% growth in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and 32% for the full year, consistent with our top line growth. When we think of the cash generated by the business to then be redeployed into value-enhancing royalties, we look to adjusted EBITDA less net interest paid. Net interest received in the quarter of $14 million reflected the semiannual timing of the payments on our $7.3 billion of unsecured notes which occurs in the first and third quarters and the strong cash position on our balance sheet which benefited from higher interest rates. For the full year, net interest paid of $145 million included interest received of $25 million on our cash position. After the $50 million upfront payment for development stage funding of MK-8189, we generated adjusted cash flow, our bottom line of $946 million or $1.56 per share for the fourth quarter.This resulted in an adjusted cash flow margin of 89% which once again highlights the efficiency of our business model. For the full year, adjusted cash flow was $2.2 billion or $3.68 per share and our adjusted cash flow margin was 80%. Let's move now to Slide 26 in our financial position. We continue to maintain significant financial firepower for future royalty acquisitions. In 2022, we deployed $2.5 billion of capital on royalty acquisitions as well as $461 million on dividends. This more than offset our strong cash flow generation over the year so that our cash and marketable securities stood at $1.7 billion at the end of December. In the beginning of 2023, we deployed an additional $500 million on the Ionis transaction that Marshall described.If we adjust for this post year-end outflow, our leverage on a pro forma basis would have been 2.7x net debt to EBITDA and 2.3x total debt-to-EBITDA. As a reminder, the fixed rate average coupon on our debt is slightly above 2% which compares to our target returns on royalty acquisitions in the high single digits to teens percentage range. I would also note that around 60% of our debt matures in 2030 or beyond. Taken together, we believe our cost of capital and debt maturity profile represent a durable competitive advantage for our business. Based on our financial strength and efficient business model, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our business plan and create value for shareholders. Slide 27 provides our full year 2023 financial guidance.We expect adjusted cash receipts to be in the range of $2.375 billion to $2.475 billion. This outlook does not include the $475 million milestone which we expect to receive from Pfizer if the FDA approves zavegepant for migraine which has a PDUFA date in the first quarter. However, if zavegepant is approved and the $475 million milestone is included in our guidance, it would imply an adjusted range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion. I will explain the other key considerations underlying our top line guidance in a moment. However, importantly and consistent with our standard practice, this guidance is based on our portfolio as of today and does not take into account any future royalty acquisitions. Turning to our operating costs. We expect payments for operating and professional costs to be approximately 8% to 9% of adjusted cash receipts in 2023, slightly above the 2022 level.We continue to believe that the degree of margin protection provided by our unique business model is impressive in today's inflationary environment. Interest paid for full year 2023 is expected to be around $170 million and to follow the established quarterly pattern with de minimis amounts payable in Q2 and Q4. This does not take into account any interest received on our cash balance which is particularly attractive at today's rates. Finally, we expect to make a $50 million milestone payment to Cytokinetics in the second half of 2023, based on the company's guidance of initiating their pivotal trial of aficamten in nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. My final slide drills down further on our adjusted cash receipt guidance. The graphic is illustrative but sets out the various pushes and pulls behind our outlook for 2023.Starting with the left-hand side, we face a high base of comparison from the $458 million accelerated Biohaven payment which we received in the fourth quarter of 2022. Since the preferred shares were redeemed, we will also no longer receive the quarterly Series A fixed payments which is another $52 million annual headwind. This brings the underlying base for 2022 adjusted cash receipts to $2.28 billion. On the right side, if we start from the adjusted cash receipt base prior to Biohaven, we expect underlying growth of between 4% to 9% this year which is expected to be largely driven by the CF franchise, Trelegy and Tremfya, partially offset by the losses of exclusivity on the DPP-IVs and Lexiscan as well as Imbruvica weakness. We also expect a modest contribution from 3 quarters of Spinraza royalties.Given the recent moderation of the U.S. dollar strength, FX is expected to represent a relatively modest headwind of minus 1% to minus 2% using today's rates. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Pablo for his closing comments.Pablo Legorreta: Thanks, Terry. Let me close by saying how pleased I am with our strong performance in 2022. Not only do we enter 2023 with solid momentum but our prospects have never looked better. To finish on Slide 30, I would like to take a moment to remind you where Royalty Pharma's business model offers a unique way to invest in biopharma, maximizing our exposure to many positive industry trends while minimizing exposure to many of its common challenges. We offer attractive diversification on the top line and bottom line. We offer strong exposure to transformative therapies, including 15 therapies with more than $1 billion in end market sales and many well-known brands in the industry. Our portfolio benefits from an average expected duration of approximately 13 years, exceeding many big pharmas and large biotechs.From a financial return perspective, we have a track record of delivering consistent and predictable double-digit unlevered returns on deployed capital. When we think about industry challenges, we do not take on significant early-stage development risk which clearly differentiates us from biopharma. Also, we have no therapeutic area bias and minimal exposure to binary risks. The differentiated reward profile, combined with our strong financial position and powerful business model is what makes Royalty Pharma a unique and, I believe, highly attractive investment proposition. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.George Grofik: We will now open up the call to your questions. Operator, please take the first question.See also 15 Fastest Growing Countries in Europe and 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

193,1175fc6d-b1d6-3a51-84f3-e17f8b486d1c,PFE,2023-02-17,Pfizer Announces Positive TALZENNA® and XTANDI® Combination Data from Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 Study,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-announces-positive-talzenna-xtandi-150000357.html,1676559600,STORY,['PFE'],"[Data show 37% reduction in risk of disease progression or death in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDISupplemental new drug application for TALZENNA and XTANDI combination granted U.S. FDA Priority ReviewNEW YORK, February 16, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) announced today positive results from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 study of TALZENNA® (talazoparib), an oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with XTANDI® (enzalutamide), demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) compared to placebo plus XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with or without homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Priority Review for Pfizer’s supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI for the treatment of men with mCRPC. The FDA grants Priority Review to medicines that may offer significant advances in treatment or may provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA’s decision on the sNDA is expected in 2023.The TALAPRO-2 results will be presented today, Thursday, February 16, at 8:00 a.m. PST during the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) as a late-breaking presentation (Abstract LBA17) and will be featured in the ASCO GU official press program.In the final rPFS analysis, TALZENNA plus XTANDI reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 37% versus placebo plus XTANDI (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.63; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.51–0.78; P&lt; 0.001). The median rPFS for the treatment arm was not reached at the time of analysis versus 21.9 months for placebo plus XTANDI. Median rPFS is reached when 50% of trial participants have had an event of disease progression or death.Story continues""Novel hormone therapies dramatically changed outcomes for patients with mCRPC in the last decade, and the results from the TALAPRO-2 study show that the addition of talazoparib to the existing standard of care adds significant clinical benefit,"" said Neeraj Agarwal, M.D., FASCO, Professor of Oncology and Presidential Endowed Chair of Cancer Research at Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, and lead investigator for TALAPRO-2. ""In addition to delaying disease progression, this combination delayed prostate-specific antigen progression and time to chemotherapy without adversely impacting patient quality of life. The TALAPRO-2 results support the potential for this combination to be practice-changing, with strong, highly consistent efficacy and observations in mCRPC patients both with or without HRR gene mutations, and across clinically relevant sub-populations.""A trend in overall survival (OS) favoring TALZENNA plus XTANDI was also observed, though these data are immature. The final OS will be reported once the predefined number of survival events has been reached. TALAPRO-2 is the first Phase 3 study to combine TALZENNA with XTANDI in patients unselected for genetic alterations in DNA damage repair pathways, directly or indirectly involved with HRR.The study also showed clinically meaningful improvement in median rPFS for patients in the study treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDI across several prospectively assessed subgroups including HRR-deficient (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30–0.70; P&lt;0.001) and HRR-non-deficient or unknown (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54–0.89; P=0.004). Objective response rates, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response ≥50%, and time to PSA progression and use of subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy and antineoplastic therapy were also significantly improved in patients treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDI versus placebo plus XTANDI. Median time to definitive clinically meaningful deterioration in global health status/quality of life was also longer in those treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDI (30.8 vs 25.0 months, respectively; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.99; P=0.04).""Patients with mCRPC need new treatment approaches that can improve outcomes, and the rPFS results from TALAPRO-2, which appears to be the longest observed in a randomized trial in this setting, demonstrate the potential of the TALZENNA and XTANDI combination, if approved, to become a new standard of care,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We are pleased that the FDA has granted Priority Review for our application, and we look forward to working with the Agency and global regulatory authorities to bring this treatment to men with mCRPC.""In the TALAPRO-2 trial, the safety of TALZENNA plus XTANDI was generally consistent with the known safety profile of each medicine. Among patients treated with TALZENNA plus XTANDI, the most common adverse events (AE) (greater than 20% of participants, all grades) included anemia (65.8%), decreased neutrophil count (35.7%), fatigue (33.7), decreased platelet count (24.6%), back pain and decreased white blood cell count (22.1% each), and decreased appetite (21.6%). The most common grade ≥3 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were anemia (46.5%), low neutrophil (18.3%), and low platelet counts (7.3%). Among patients treated with placebo plus XTANDI, the most common AEs (greater than 15%) were fatigue (29.4%), arthralgia (19.7%), back pain (18.0%), anemia (17.5%), constipation (17.0%), and decreased appetite (15.7%). The most common grade &gt;3 AEs were hypertension (7.5%), anemia (4.2%), and fatigue (2.0%). TEAEs led to discontinuation of TALZENNA in 19.1% of patients versus 12.2% of placebo. Discontinuation rates of XTANDI were generally consistent across both study arms (10.8% vs 11.0%).Pfizer plans to submit detailed results from the trial for peer-reviewed publication. In addition to the FDA, Pfizer has also shared these data with the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies to support regulatory filings and will provide further updates at the appropriate time.Neither TALZENNA nor the combination of TALZENNA plus XTANDI has been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of mCRPC. In addition to the TALAPRO-2 trial, the combination of TALZENNA plus XTANDI is being investigated in the TALAPRO-3 trial (NCT04821622), a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in men with HRR-deficient metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland and has progressed despite medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. Approximately 10%–20% of prostate cancer patients develop mCRPC within 5−7 years of diagnosis,1 and in the U.S., in 2020, approximately 60-90 thousand cases of the 3 million prostate cancer cases were mCRPC.2About TALAPRO-2The Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial is a two-part, two-cohort, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 1,106 patients with mCRPC (with no systemic treatments initiated after documentation of mCRPC) at sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The study included two patient cohorts: all-comers (n=750) and those with HRR mutations (HRRm; n=380). Patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or who had bilateral orchiectomy in the trial were randomized to receive TALZENNA 0.5 mg/day plus XTANDI 160mg/day, or placebo plus XTANDI 160 mg/day.The primary endpoint of the trial is radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to first objective evidence of radiographic progression by blinded independent review, or death, whichever occurs first, in both cohort 1 (all-comers) and cohort 2 (those with HRRm). The trial is still ongoing for cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, and PSA response.For more information on the TALAPRO-2 trial (NCT03395197), go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.About TALZENNA® (talazoparib)TALZENNA (talazoparib) is an oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which plays a role in DNA damage repair. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that TALZENNA blocks PARP enzyme activity and traps PARP at the site of DNA damage, leading to decreased cancer cell growth and cancer cell death.TALZENNA is approved in over 70 countries, including the U.S., as a once daily monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.TALZENNA is being investigated as a combination therapy with XTANDI® (enzalutamide) in men with advanced prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 clinical trial and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) in the Phase 3 TALAPRO-3 clinical trial. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of a PARP inhibitor and an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSi) may result in an enhanced anti-tumor effect. Other combinations of TALZENNA with targeted therapies are also being studied in various solid tumors.TALZENNA® (talazoparib) Indication in the U.S.TALZENNA (talazoparib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for TALZENNA.TALZENNA® (talazoparib) Important Safety InformationMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in &lt;1% (3 out of 787, 0.4%) of solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA in clinical studies. The duration of TALZENNA treatment in these three patients prior to developing MDS/AML was 4 months, 24 months, and 60 months respectively. These patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy.Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA. Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 21%, and 15% of patients receiving TALZENNA. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 0.7%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of patients.Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. If hematological toxicity occurs, dose modifications (dosing interruption with or without dose reduction) are recommended. With respect to MDS/AML, for prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA.TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TALZENNA treatment. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for at least 4 months after receiving the last dose. Based on animal studies, TALZENNA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Advise women not to breastfeed while taking TALZENNA and for at least 1 month after receiving the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (62% vs 50%), anemia (53% vs 18%), nausea (49% vs 47%), neutropenia (35% vs 43%), headache (33% vs 22%), thrombocytopenia (27% vs 7%), vomiting (25% vs 23%), alopecia (25% vs 28%), diarrhea (22% vs 26%), and decreased appetite (21% vs 22%).The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥10%) for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were anemia (39% vs 5%), neutropenia (21% vs 35%), and thrombocytopenia (15% vs 2%).The most common lab abnormalities (≥25%) for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were decreases in hemoglobin (90% vs 77%), leukocytes (84% vs 73%), lymphocytes (76% vs 53%), neutrophils (68% vs 70%), platelets (55% vs 29%), and calcium (28% vs 16%) and increases in glucose (54% vs 51%), aspartate aminotransferase (37% vs 48%), alkaline phosphatase (36% vs 34%), and alanine aminotransferase (33% vs 37%).Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors may increase TALZENNA exposure. If coadministering with the P-gp inhibitors amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, itraconazole, or verapamil is unavoidable, reduce the TALZENNA dose to 0.75 mg once daily. When the P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, increase the TALZENNA dose (after 3–5 half-lives of the P-gp inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the P-gp inhibitor. When coadministering TALZENNA with other known P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors, monitor patients for potential increased adverse reactions.For patients with moderate renal impairment, the recommended dose of TALZENNA is 0.75 mg once daily. For patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended dose of TALZENNA is 0.5 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment. TALZENNA has not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.Please see full U.S. Prescribing Information and Patient Information for TALZENNA® (talazoparib) at www.TALZENNA.com.About XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and Important Safety InformationXTANDI (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).Overall survival benefit has been observed in patients treated with XTANDI in mCRPC, nmCRPC, and mCSPC.Warnings and PrecautionsSeizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following predisposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, history of traumatic brain or head injury, history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.Ischemic Heart Disease In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.7% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.Falls and Fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI.Adverse Reactions (ARs)In the data from the four randomized placebo-controlled trials, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.In AFFIRM, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher ARs were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. In PREVAIL, the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 6% of XTANDI-treated patients. In TERRAIN, the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.In PROSPER, the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher ARs were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients.In ARCHES, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CSPC (mCSPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 24% of XTANDI-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 5% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients.Lab Abnormalities: Lab abnormalities that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, and more frequently (&gt; 2%) in the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in the pooled, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia.Hypertension: In the combined data from four randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 12% of XTANDI patients and 5% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in &lt; 1% of patients in each arm.Drug InteractionsEffect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI. Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI.Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.Please see Full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.About Pfizer OncologyAt Pfizer Oncology, we are committed to advancing medicines wherever we believe we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living with cancer.

Sullivan,"" a Fox spokesperson said in a statement.A five-week trial is scheduled to begin on April 17.Dominion's filing is replete with references to emails and statements in which Fox Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch and other top Fox executives say the claims made about Dominion on-air were false.Story continuesThe filing reflects the outcome of months of discovery from both sides. Dominion in January questioned Murdoch under oath, the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case.Dominion must prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy.Dominion said in its brief that Murdoch internally described the election claims as ""really crazy"" and ""damaging"" but declined to wield his editorial power to stop them.For example, according to Dominion's filing, when Murdoch watched Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell make unfounded claims about Dominion about two weeks after the election, he told Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott: ""Terrible stuff damaging everybody, I fear.""Other top Fox executives including Scott repeatedly raised the alarm over false election fraud claims but failed to act because they feared losing viewers to far-right competitor Newsmax, Dominion said.The underlying exhibits for many of those statements remain under seal. Fox has said Dominion took them out of context.Representatives for Powell and Giuliani could not immediately be reached for comment. A Fox Corp spokesman declined to comment on Murdoch's behalf.Fox filed a counterclaim in Delaware Superior Court on Thursday, alleging that Dominion has no evidence to support its “staggering” damages claim. Fox claimed Dominion’s private equity owners are using the suit to seek windfall profits on an asset they purchased at an $80 million value in 2018.In its summary judgment filing, Fox argued that Trump’s claims about the election were ""undeniably newsworthy"" and that viewers understood they were merely being reported as allegations.Fox also argued that Dominion’s suit advances overly broad interpretations of defamation law, takes quotes from its coverage out of context and ignores its reporting of Dominion’s rebuttals to the false claims.""Dominion’s lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment and the free press,"" Fox wrote in its filing.

Sullivan,"" a Fox spokesperson said in a statement.Dominion filed suit against parent company Fox Corp in November 2021; the case was consolidated in December.As part of discovery, Dominion has sought communications from Fox Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch, his son, Fox Corp Chief Executive Officer Lachlan Murdoch, and Fox News personnel as it seeks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of ""actual malice"" that public figures must prove to prevail in defamation cases.""The heart of this is really going to be whether there was false information put on the air, and whether they knew it was false or whether they were reckless in putting it on the air,"" said Roy Gutterman, director of the Newhouse School's Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University.Story continuesDominion alleged in its lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances in which Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden.Thursday’s filing reflects the outcome of months of discovery from both sides. Dominion in January questioned Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch under oath, the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case.Earlier on Thursday, Fox filed a counterclaim in Delaware Superior Court, alleging that Dominion has no evidence to support its “staggering” damages claim.A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17.

The company's motion for summary judgment in the case is expected to made public by the end of the day Thursday.Dominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit in Delaware that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is suing separately.In its filing, Fox claimed Dominion remains a financially sound company with annual revenues approaching $100 million despite the election-rigging claims.Fox alleged Dominion’s lawsuit serves only to “generate headlines, chill First Amendment-protected speech, and unjustly enrich” the company’s investors, who according to Fox’s filing have valued Dominion at roughly $80 million.New York-based Fox asked the court to rule in its favor under a state law intended to protect defendants from lawsuits aimed at stifling free speech.Dominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden.On Nov. 30, 2020, for example, Powell appeared on Sean Hannity’s program, where she falsely stated that Dominion machines “ran an algorithm that shaved off votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden. And they used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump.”Story continuesDominion has sought communications from Fox Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other top Fox personnel as it seeks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy.

(AP) — Hosts at Fox News had serious concerns about allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election being made by guests who were allies of former President Donald Trump, according to court filings in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the network.“Sidney Powell is lying,” about having evidence for election fraud, Tucker Carlson told a producer about the attorney on Nov. 16, 2020, according to an excerpt from an exhibit that remains under seal.The internal communication was included in a redacted summary judgment brief filed Thursday by attorneys for Dominion Voting Systems.Carlson also referred to Powell in a text as an “unguided missile,” and “dangerous as hell.” Fellow host Laura Ingraham, meanwhile, told Carlson that Powell is “a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy,” referring to former New York mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani.Sean Hannity, meanwhile, said in a deposition “that whole narrative that Sidney was pushing, I did not believe it for one second,"" according to Dominion's filing.Denver-based Dominion, which sells electronic voting hardware and software, is suing both Fox News and parent company Fox Corporation. Dominion said some Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims that Dominion had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements.Attorneys for the cable news giant argued in a counterclaim unsealed Thursday that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment. They said Dominion has advanced “novel defamation theories” and is seeking a “staggering” damage figure aimed at generating headlines, chilling protected speech and enriching Dominion’s private equity owner, Staple Street Capital Partners.“Dominion brought this lawsuit to punish FNN for reporting on one of the biggest stories of the day— allegations by the sitting President of the United States and his surrogates that the 2020 election was affected by fraud,” the counterclaim states. “The very fact of those allegations was newsworthy.”Story continuesFox attorneys also said in their own summary judgment brief that Carlson repeatedly questioned Powell’s claims in his broadcasts. “When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her,” Carlson told viewers on Nov. 19, 2020.Fox attorneys say Dominion’s own public relations firm expressed skepticism in December 2020 as to whether the network's coverage was defamatory. They also point to an email from Oct. 30, 2020, just days before the election, in which Dominion's director of product strategy and security complained that the company's products were “just riddled with bugs.”In their counterclaim, Fox attorneys wrote that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations.Fox’s counterclaim is based on New York’s “anti-SLAAP” law. Such laws are aimed at protecting people trying to exercise their First Amendment rights from being intimidated by “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPPs.“According to Dominion, FNN had a duty not to truthfully report the President’s allegations but to suppress them or denounce them as false,” Fox attorneys wrote. “Dominion is fundamentally mistaken. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side.”Fox attorneys warn that threatening the company with a $1.6 billion judgment will cause other media outlets to think twice about what they report. They also say documents produced in the lawsuit show that Dominion has not suffered any economic harm and do not indicate that it lost any customers as the result of Fox’s election coverage.Superior Court Judge Eric Davis is scheduled to preside over a trial beginning in mid-April, but granting summary judgment to either side would obviate the need for a jury trial that could stretch over five weeks.In its 192-page brief, Dominion said the judge should rule in its favor because “no reasonable juror could find in Fox’s favor on each element of Dominion’s defamation claim.” Dominion attorneys also assert that no reasonable juror could find in favor of Fox’s “neutral reportage” and “fair report” defenses.“Recounts and audits conducted by election officials across the U.S. repeatedly confirmed the election’s outcome, including specifically that Dominion’s machines accurately counted votes,"" Dominion's filing states. “That evidence alone more than suffices for summary judgment on the falsity of the claims that Dominion rigged the election and its software manipulated vote counts.”Fox News attorneys argue the network's coverage and commentary are not defamatory.""Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that Dominion could point to any statement that could be actionable defamation, this court should grant Fox News’ summary judgment motion for the independent reason that Dominion lacks clear and convincing evidence that the relevant individuals at Fox News made or published any statement with actual malice,"" the attorneys wrote.Davis ruled last month that, for the purposes of the defamation claims, he will consider Dominion to be a public figure. That means Dominion must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Fox defendants acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.Attorneys for Fox Corp. joined in the brief filed by Fox News, while also asserting that the parent company is independently entitled to summary judgment because Dominion has not produced any evidence needed to hold it liable.]"

If you want to see more high growth AI stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.OpenAI's ChatGPT has taken the world by storm.In just five days, the AI chat app reached 1 million users, and in two months since its launch, ChatGPT has gained 100 million users, making it arguably the fastest growing internet consumer app in history.While it makes mistakes, ChatGPT has offered a lot of utility to a lot of people.Even tech leaders are impressed.When it came to ChatGPT, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this month, ""When was the last time we saw a piece of technology that is so versatile that it can solve problems and surprise people in so many ways so often? It can write a poem of course, it could fill out a spreadsheet, it can write a SQL query and do a SQL query, it can write python code, it can write Verilog. And if it can't do it today, of course it will be able to do it someday. So the fact that you have this tool that can do all these different things has really surprised a lot of people around the world. Now, for a lot of people who have been working on this, we have been waiting for this moment. This is the iPhone moment, if you will, of artificial intelligence.""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates also said recently that ChatGPT 'will change our world'.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, could benefit from ChatGPT's success given it invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and another $10 billion in the company this year.OpenAI also uses Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, for a lot of its processing. If ChatGPT continues to grow, the company's demand for Microsoft Azure will likely continue to increase too.Microsoft is also incorporating ChatGPT into its search engine, Bing, to potentially gain market share from Google.Similarly, a lot of other big tech companies also have substantial AI growth potential in the future given how transformative the industry could be.Story continuesThe technology industry can change very quickly where companies can gain and lose market share in a short amount of time. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Photo by mahdis mousavi on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy, we took 10 stocks with competitive advantages that have substantial growth opportunities in AI in the future and we ranked them based on their market capitalization.High growth in this article means a company has meaningful growth potential in AI in the long term.We nevertheless include the EPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years ratio as a datapoint for each company.For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment.10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $122.06 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 6.67%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has growth potential in AI given it's one of the leaders in quantum computing. If successful, quantum computing could be faster than conventional computers at certain computing tasks and that faster speed could make AI even more useful as a result.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) explains its quantum business, ""This nascent technology is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s most powerful classical supercomputers cannot solve and never will. Our community of clients and partners comprises 210+ Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions, national labs, and startups. With the largest fleet of 20+ of the most powerful quantum systems in the world, we are aiming to turn the world’s most challenging problems into valuable opportunities.""Given quantum computers are still in their development stage, however, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is not expected to grow very quickly in the next five years given its EPS growth forecast next 5 year ratio of 6.67%. In the long term, the company does have potential if it successfully maintains its leadership in quantum computing.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a stock with meaningful AI growth potential in the future.9. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $144.52 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 15.41%SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a leading enterprise software company that has incorporated AI into its software to potentially help its customers. Among other things, the company offers AI-powered insights, recommendations, and more in its SAP applications. If SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) can successfully offer more value with AI in its products, the company could potentially realize higher demand in the long term. As of February 16, the company has a forward P/E ratio of 17.45 and a market capitalization of $144.52 billion, ranking #9 on our list of 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.8. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $236.52 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 8.35%Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has AI growth potential given it is a leading enterprise software company that could realize higher demand if it successfully incorporates AI into its software in a way that offers more value to its customers. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) also has a cloud business that could potentially realize higher demand if AI processing needs increase. One of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)'s cloud business customers is TikTok which uses AI to make better suggestions.7. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $262.44 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 29.80%ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leading semiconductor equipment producer that is on the cutting edge in its field. Considering AI apps require computer processing that uses semiconductors, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) could realize higher demand if AI processing increases faster than expected. Although shares currently trade for a P/E ratio of 43.18, analysts expect the company to grow EPS substantially over the next 5 years.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.6. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $447.07 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 3.63%Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a lot of potential in AI given it has billions of monthly users it could offer AI services to. If it is successful in terms of making its metaverse products, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could also potentially incorporate AI into the metaverse and potentially sell more high margin services as a result. Although analysts only see the company growing EPS by an average of 3.63% a year over the next 5 years, the company has substantially higher growth potential in the long term if it is successful in the metaverse and AI.With its market capitalization of $447.07 billion as of 2/16, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks #6 on our list of 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are stocks with meaningful growth potential in AI in the future.Click to continue reading and see 5 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Suggested articles:10 Most Advanced Countries in Nuclear Fusion25 Largest Ports in the World15 Fastest Growing Countries in AsiaDisclosure: None. 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In any large company, simply “getting the information together” before making any major administrative decision can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, Krishna said, but A.I.’s speed and efficiency means that type of work will likely be the first to be automated.Experts have warned for a while that A.I. could soon threaten clerical and administrative jobs. “A.I. will increasingly replace repetitive jobs, not just for blue-collar work, but a lot of white-collar work,” Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist focused on A.I., said in 2019.Companies are exploring how to integrate A.I. to improve their efficiency, but removing bureaucracy may also mean removing jobs that might not come back.“I think there’s a risk that ChatGPT makes us a lot more productive in easy-to-do stuff, but the hard part to figure out is how we can use A.I. to create innovation that then creates new occupations and new industries,” Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist who 10 years ago predicted automation would wipe out 47% of U.S. jobs, told Fortune earlier this month.IBM’s Krishna told the FT that “regulatory work,” from audits at financial firms to medicinal research in health care, are also likely to be automated away at some point in the future, but he argued the job market disruption will not necessarily be a bad thing.Story continues“We do have a shortage of labor in the real world, and that’s because of a demographic issue that the world is facing. So we have to have technologies that help,” Krishna said. In the U.S. and much of the developed world, labor markets are set to become progressively tighter in the coming decades as the retirement-age group swells and the working-age population becomes thinner.In the U.S., years of declining birth rates have sparked fears of a shrinking labor force in the coming decades. Drops in birth rates and low immigration levels during the pandemic led to population growth in the country nearly flatlining in 2021, before marginally recovering last year as immigration rates picked up again. But the U.S. demographic shift may have already begun, as employers struggle to add young workers as an increasing number of older Americans leave the workforce.The effects of a global demographic shift are already playing out in countries like China and Japan, and many more countries in the world are preparing for how to survive in a future where there aren’t enough young people to fill jobs. Some governments have resorted to measures like offering families money to have more kids and promoting immigration, but automating away jobs that can be done by machines may be an inevitable option.“Maybe we can find tools that replace some portions of labor, and it’s a good thing this time,” Krishna said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

(TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas” or the “Company”) today announced the closing of the initial tranche, an investment of $320 million, of its previously announced $650 million investment by General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) (“GM”). Proceeds from GM’s investment are to be used to accelerate the development of the Company’s Thacker Pass lithium project (“Thacker Pass”) located in Humboldt County, Nevada, the largest known lithium resource in the United States that is fully permitted to begin construction.“The beginning of construction at Thacker Pass is imminent following last week’s favorable ruling on the Record of Decision and the closing of GM’s initial investment,” said Jonathan Evans, President and CEO of Lithium Americas. “GM’s investment is a landmark transaction that will help put millions of drivers into electric vehicles while creating jobs and a strong and secure U.S. supply chain for EV raw materials.”GM is now Lithium Americas largest shareholder and offtake partner. Lithium Americas continues to pursue a commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program, which will help scale lithium production at Thacker Pass to support production of nearly one million EVs annually.As previously disclosed, GM is making a $650 million equity investment in the Company in two tranches. In connection with today’s initial closing, GM has purchased 15 million common shares of the Company at a price of $21.34 per share for gross proceeds of $320 million. The Company expects to close the second and final tranche following the Company’s contemplated separation of its U.S. and Argentine businesses in the second half of 2023 and the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent to closing. For the final $330 million investment, GM has agreed to subscribe for shares in the U.S. business based on the then market price on the date of subscription, subject to a cap of $27.74 per share (adjusted for the separation).Story continuesThe parties have also completed the additional transactions contemplated to occur concurrent with the closing of the initial tranche, including execution of the offtake agreement, investor rights agreement and second tranche subscription agreement, as well as issuance of the second tranche alternative exercise warrants.All figures presented are in U.S. Dollars.FURTHER INFORMATIONFor full details on the GM investment, refer to the Company’s news releases dated January 31, 2023.

Shares have added about 2.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is United due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Earnings Beat in Q4United Airlines' fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.46 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07. In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.60 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The fourth quarter of 2022 was the third consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,400 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,230 million. UAL’s revenues increased 51.37% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.9% from fourth-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by 62.9% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 90.3% of the top line) to $11,202 million. Moreover, passenger revenues increased 12.8% from fourth-quarter 2019 reading. Nearly 39 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the December quarter. This implied that passenger volume was 90% of the pre-pandemic volume.Cargo revenues skyrocketed 49.4% from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals to $472 million. Revenues from other sources increased 13.6% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to $726 million.Other Details of Q4Below, we present all comparisons (in % terms) with fourth-quarter 2019 figures unless otherwise stated.Consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (a key measure of unit revenues) increased 24.6%. Total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) rose 25.8% to 19.29 cents. The average yield per revenue passenger mile was up 20.8% to 20.46 cents.Story continuesConsolidated airline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, dropped 6.6%, while capacity, measured in available seat miles, fell 9.5%. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seat occupancy) inched up 2.7 percentage points to 85.2%.The average aircraft fuel price per gallon jumped 68.6% to $3.54. Fuel gallons consumed were down 12.6% from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.Adjusted operating expenses increased 0.7% to $7,529 million. Operating expenses (on a reported basis) increased 9.9% to $11,023 million. Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, ascended 11.2% to 11.71 cents.United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $7,166 million compared with $11,258 million at the end of the prior quarter. Long-term debt at the end of the reported quarter was $28,283 million compared with $28,490 million at the end of the prior quarter.OutlookFor the first quarter of 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve by around 20% from the year-ago reported figure. TRASM is anticipated to grow almost 25% year over year. CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is expected to decline in the range of 3-4%.Total revenues are anticipated to grow almost 50% year over year. UAL expects first-quarter earnings per share in the $0.5-$1.00 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is currently pegged at 10 cents.UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.19 in the first quarter.For 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to stay in the high teens. TRASM is anticipated to remain flat. CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is expected to remain flat.Total revenues are anticipated to stay in the high teens.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-110058272.html,1676631658.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$282 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$236. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuitive Surgical's current trading price of US$240 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What Is Intuitive Surgical Worth?Intuitive Surgical appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Intuitive Surgical’s ratio of 63.64x is above its peer average of 37.5x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Medical Equipment industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Intuitive Surgical’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Intuitive Surgical look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Intuitive Surgical's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 54%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ISRG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ISRG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ISRG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ISRG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ross Stores basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Ross Stores, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ross StoresFor the fiscal year ending January 2023, this discount retailer is expected to earn $4.30 per share, which is a change of -11.7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ross Stores. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Ross Stores to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Ross Stores (ROST) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.27 a share 12 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 28, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.27 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.23 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Ross Stores has an Earnings ESP of 3.16%.ROST is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Wayfair (W) as well.Wayfair, which is readying to report earnings on February 23, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently -$1.53 a share, and W is seven days out from its next earnings report.For Wayfair, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$1.62 is 5.11%.Story continuesROST and W's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NASDAQ:ADI) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 15, 2023Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call. Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&amp;A. Sir, the floor is yours.Michael Lucarelli: Thank you, Gigi, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On to disclosures. Information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and in our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as date of this call.We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?Vincent Roche: Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Well, I'm very pleased to share that ADI continued to execute exceptionally well in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Revenue was $3.25 billion, up 21% year-over-year, strength was broad based with all B2B markets, up single-digits. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 51% respectively and adjusted EPS achieved another record at $2.75. Our continued success is driven by a relentless focus on customer collaboration, a growing demand for our innovative technologies and strong operational execution. We play a long game and are excited about what the future holds for us to ensure that we capture the opportunity ahead.Story continuesWe've been steadily increasing investments in R&amp;D, manufacturing capabilities and in partnerships that deepen our value to our customers now and over the long-term. For example, in R&amp;D, we've invested $1.7 billion over the trailing 12 months to strengthen our core franchises and capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers. Over the same period, we've invested $760 million in CapEx to enhance the resiliency of our internal semiconductor manufacturing operations. These investments not only increase our operational resiliency, but also modernize our fabs to better address our sustainability ambitions. As mentioned in our press release, our industrial and automotive businesses remain strong as we gain market share. So this morning, I want to focus specifically on our industrial business, which continues to grow significantly despite the macroeconomic backdrop.Now, from a big picture perspective, the industrial market is the bedrock of ADI, representing more than half of our total revenue. It's also our most diverse and profitable business segment with tens of thousands of customers and products that sustain revenue streams for decades. Additionally, ADI's industrial revenue is derived from high performance technology in mission-critical CapEx-intensive equipment across the myriad applications. Our leadership position has been strengthened over the last decade as we intensified our focus in this market and invested over $5 billion in R&amp;D activities to capture the opportunity across the hundreds of applications that characterize the industrial sector. This space is inherently fragmented and the unmatched breadth and depth of ADI's portfolio uniquely allows us to address our customer's needs across the full spectrum of applications.With core component building blocks to application-specific solutions that encompass analog, digital and algorithms. Today, we're seeing the rise of new industrial applications that require more sophisticated and more complex architectures as machines become more intelligent and more sustainable. This is driving more semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx, unlocking new opportunities for our portfolio. While this transformation is benefiting all of our industrial applications, including healthcare and aerospace, let me share how we're winning an industrial automation and instrumentation more specifically and discuss the burgeoning opportunity across the electrification ecosystem. So, starting first with industrial automation. Here, our customers are upgrading their factories with more automation and connectivity to increase output with greater energy efficiency.ADI's broad portfolio helps customers create these more resilient and flexible footprints while lowering their carbon emissions on the journey to net-zero. As an example, at a leading U.S. robotics manufacturer, we've won additional content across power sensing and GMSL connectivity. Our systems approach reduced our customers' design time and increased our content per cobot by 4x. Also in the last quarter, our IO-Link solution was designed in at multiple leading industrial automation customers. These solutions are critical for delivering robust connectivity to the edge of the factory floor. Turning our attention now to our instrumentation and test business. This subsector is highly aligned to secular growth trends from connectivity to AI-assisted compute to electrification to drug discovery and gene therapies.The consistent thread across this diverse set of applications is the growing complexity that requires more advanced metrology and test. The results, our average content per system is now 2x to 3x higher. Further, the localization of semiconductor supply is providing additional tailwinds for our test business. We've secured multiple design wins in North America as well as Asia for memory and high-performance compute. And finally, on to one of our fastest-growing areas, the electrification ecosystem. The collective need for a more sustainable future is driving massive growth in electrical grid infrastructure. Now let me share two examples with you. First, industrial and automotive companies have announced more than $300 billion of investments in greenfield gigafactories, essential to the production of batteries to proliferate the electrification ecosystem.These gigafactories will drive additional demand for our formation and test solutions critical to producing higher density batteries. Further, given the inherent safety hazards of using higher cell voltages, these factories will also provide new growth vectors for ADI. In our sustainable energy franchise, we're leveraging our industry-leading automotive BMS solutions into energy storage systems for electrical grids and fast-charging infrastructure. We've won designs at leading EV infrastructure manufacturers in North America, Europe and Asia, putting us on a path to more than tripling this business in the coming years. Of course, while no market is fully immune to adverse economic cycles, our industrial business is highly diversified and aligned with secular trends.This has translated to more durable revenue streams with sales in this sector increasing more than 25% over the trailing 12 months despite a weakening economic backdrop. But looking ahead, we see continued strength in this franchise as the breadth and depth of our portfolio, our deep customer collaborations and design win pipeline momentum underpin our new phase of profitable growth. So in closing, ADI's business model is diverse, resilient and rich with opportunity. I'm very optimistic about what our future holds as we drive enhanced value for our customers employees and shareholders as well as society at large. And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth.SemiconductorPhoto by Yogesh Phuyal on UnsplashPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. First quarter revenue of $3.25 billion finished at the high end of our outlook, driven by continued share gains in industrial and automotive. Our B2B markets represented 89% of revenue, up 25% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially despite our first quarter typically being down. Now let's look at performance by end markets. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market represented 52% of revenue and hit another all-time high. This business has grown sequentially for 12 consecutive quarters.All markets increased year-over-year, led by automation, sustainable energy, instrumentation and test. Automotive, which represented 22% of revenue, also achieved another record, increasing 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. All applications grew double digits year-over-year as our market leading positions across battery management and in-cabin connectivity continue to deliver significant growth. Communications, which represented 15% of revenue, grew 18% year-over-year. As expected, comms declined slightly sequentially as strength in wired was offset by softness in wireless due to the timing of 5G deployments. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 5% year-over-year and declined 14% sequentially given weaker market trends and seasonality.Now onto the rest of the P&amp;L. Gross margin of 73.6% expanded 170 basis points year-over-year, unfavorable mix and cost synergies. OpEx was $733 million down slightly sequentially as we balance strategic hiring with the tight discretionary spend and synergy capture. Given our strong operating leverage combined with the synergy savings, our operating margin was 51.1%. Importantly, we have already captured nearly all of the $400 million cost synergy goals. As such, our communication will now turn to the revenue synergy opportunities from our combined portfolio and our complimentary customer base with Maxim. Recall that Anelise, our Chief Customer Officer, unveiled how we are strategically approaching these synergies during our Investor Day, and Vince has routinely highlighted some of these compelling opportunities over the past few quarters.To that end, we are closely monitoring and measuring progress from opportunity to design win to new revenue. And while it is still early, design win momentum to date has exceeded our expectations. This gives us increased confidence in achieving our $1 billion plus revenue synergy opportunity that we outlined at our Investor Day. Non-op expenses were $60 million, and the tax rate was just over 12%. All told, EPS came in at $2.75, up 42% year-over-year and hitting a new record. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio below 1. Days of inventory increase to 155, while channel inventory remains below our target level. Recall that last quarter, we outlined our strategy to rebuild strategic die bank and hold more finished goods inventory on our balance sheet as we moderate shipment into the channel during this time of inflection.Moving on to cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $176 million and $764 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 6% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx to be high-single-digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then decline in subsequent years to our long-term target of mid-single-digit. These investments will double our internal revenue output exiting next year and support strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies enhances our resiliency and offers our customers additional optionality. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $4.3 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Over this period, we have returned $4.7 billion to shareholders or over 100% of free cash flow via $3.1 billion of buybacks and dividends of $1.6 billion.We just raised our quarterly dividend by 13%, marking our fifth consecutive double digit increase, and 19 consecutive years of increases. This is a testament to our durable operating model that has generated positive free cash flow for 26 consecutive years. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. The dividend is the cornerstone of this policy, and we look to increase our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with remaining cash used for share count reduction. Now, similar to prior quarters, I'd like to give a brief update on the operating backdrop. First, on markets. Industrial orders, as Vince highlighted, remain the strongest followed by automotive, while comms and consumer remain weak. Given the rapidly changing environment, we are diligently working with our customers to remove orders that they may no longer require.At the same time, we have increased our supply by growing our internal output and working with our foundry partners. These actions have reduced our lead times with half of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. Despite this, backlog coverage remains around one year of revenue. As such, we expect our book-to-bill will remain below parody over the next couple quarters as our backlog returns to more normal levels. Given these dynamics, we are guiding second quarter revenue to be $3.2 billion plus or minus $100 million. We expect continued sequential growth in our industrial and automotive markets and another sequential decline in our communications and consumer markets. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high-single-digits year-over-year with our B2B markets up over 10% once again.Operating margin is expected to be 51% plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 11% to 13% for the year. This guide reflects the new U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&amp;D expenses for tax purposes, resulting in higher upfront cash tax payments, but lowers our effective tax rate temporarily due to the deferred tax accounting requirements. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.75, plus or minus $0.10. In all, the macro backdrop remains uncertain. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the near-term, given the resilient strength across our industrial and auto businesses, which represent over 75% of our revenue. Longer-term, we remain well positioned to drive growth enabled by our diverse high performance portfolio aligned with the key secular trends at the Intelligent Edge.Let me now pass it back to Mike for our Q&amp;A.Michael Lucarelli: Thanks, Prashanth.

The CPI was up 6.4% from the same period in 2022, mostly due to an increase in the prices of shelter, food and energy price. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq have already posted a negative return of 2.31%, 7.32%, and 14.54% over the past year.Domestic inflation, which poses a serious threat to the economy, has shown signs of receding in recent months after the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hike stance to dry out liquidity from the market. The Fed is now more focused on services inflation, in particular labor prices, with average hourly earnings up 10 cents to $33.03. More than half a million jobs were added in January despite high inflation, rising interest rates and weakening economy prospects. Retail sales in the said period grew at 3.0%, which is the maximum in two years despite higher borrowing costs. It seems getting control over inflation is more complex than what markets had anticipated. The Fed is expected to continue with its hawkish stance in order to tame inflation to achieve a disinflation trend. The fear of recession, which subsided for a while, seems to have returned as further rate hikes will not bode well for financial markets.Further geopolitical tensions in the east continue to remain a serious threat to the global energy market and supply chain distribution. Thus, investors seeking regular income and looking to preserve capital in such an unstable condition may invest in matured businesses with a regular dividend payout.These stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during an economic crisis.Companies, which tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout, comparatively outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility. Investors can expect a regular flow of income in volatile market conditions.Story continuesOn that note, let us look at companies like Banco Bilbao Viscaya Argentaria BBVA, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies WAB, Middlefield Banc MBCN, Analog Devices ADI and Avient AVNT that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Banco Bilbao Viscaya Argentaria is a Bilbao, Spain-based company.

If you want to see more most profitable Robinhood stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks.Robinhood is a brokerage firm that helped lower the cost of commissions for buying stocks.Because Robinhood didn't charge any commissions for buying stocks on its brokerage, several major brokerages also lowered their commissions as a result for buying stocks.As a result, many consumers have saved money in terms of commissions due to Robinhood's business model. Instead of making money on commissions, Robinhood tries to make money on other things such as margin interest.Previously, Robinhood published an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. According to the company's Q4 results, the company had 11.4 million monthly active users.Some stocks held by Robinhood users are lower quality stocks that I would stay away from.On the other hand, some popular stocks in Robinhood include some dominant blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable. Among the blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable are, in fact, some of America's most profitable companies by net income in 2022.In terms of 2023, the profits of many companies will depend on how the U.S. economy and the world economy does.In terms of how the U.S. economy does, how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further could affect U.S. economic growth in 2023. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession which could lead to earnings decreasing for many companies.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's policy depends on decision makers and also economic data.In terms of the latest economic data on inflation, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% for the month of January, which translates to an annual rise of 6.4%. The rise in the month was a little higher than economist estimates of an increase of 0.4% on the month and 6.2% on the year.Story continuesGiven the market could decline if economic data fails to meet expectations, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.FacebookPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks, we took the stocks listed on 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood and ranked them based on net income according to YCharts.We replaced The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) with Walmart Inc.

230,c98cbecc-cc77-33e2-a3e7-cd5a995b7127,V,2023-02-17,Brokers Suggest Investing in Visa (V): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-visa-v-143002644.html,1676557802,STORY,['V'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Visa (V) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.4% and 9.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Visa, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in V?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.7% over the past month to $8.43.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa.

Soaring prices in the wake of the invasion were the trigger for the tax.Despite the deferral of drilling at Kraken, Enquest plans to push ahead with investment at other fields, Magnus and Golden Eagle.The delay at Kraken is not expected to dent Enquest’s output this year, as the drilling was not expected to bring on extra supplies until towards the end of the year.Kraken produced 18,396 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2022.

The forward curve is still in contango and if we see some activity from China, rates could pick up quickly,"" he said, referring to when prompt prices fall below forward prices.While there has been some buying activity, overall demand is still considered weak, said Lee Rou Urn, Asia head of LNG pricing at Argus Media.""It will require more of other utilities in northeast Asia to emerge for cargoes in order to provide more support for prices,"" said Lee.In Europe, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily north-west Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in April on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $14.452/mmBtu on Feb. 16, a discount of $1.80/mmBtu to the April gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub, said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG.""Despite renewed buying from Asia, the arbitrage from the U.S. remained closed, with netbacks favouring Europe-bound LNG deliveries from North America.""The European benchmark gas contract fell to a fresh 17-month low as well on Friday on the back of a comfortable supply outlook, and as good storage levels and moderate weather limited demand.Story continues""On the Europe side, fundamentals are also rather weak particularly with the Freeport LNG export facility having loaded its second cargo earlier this week,"" added Argus' Lee.""Underground storages are still much higher now compared to the same period last year, so there is still limited impetus from European buyers to start importing LNG now.""Freeport LNG, the second largest LNG export facility in the U.S., had this week sought permission from federal regulators to restart commercial operations at its long-idled export plant in Texas that was shut due to a fire.The amount of gas flowing from U.S. pipelines to Freeport jumped to its highest since the facility was shut after the company restarted one of the plant's three liquefaction trains, which turns gas into LNG for export.Meanwhile, LNG spot freight rates in the Atlantic rose on a weekly basis for the first time since November as the market stabilises, said Henry Bennett, global head of pricing at Spark Commodities.Atlantic rates edged up on the week to $55,000/day on Friday, while Pacific rates also rose to $69,250/day.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Snap-on's shares before the 22nd of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.62 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.48 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Snap-on has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current stock price of $252.45. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Snap-on Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Snap-on's payout ratio is modest, at just 34% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Snap-on generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (53%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's positive to see that Snap-on's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Snap-on's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Snap-on is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Snap-on has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpHas Snap-on got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Snap-on paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in Snap-on for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

However, sales bounced back in January as inflation showed signs of easing. Demand is still high, which is helping boost retail sales. Moreover, the labor market is still going strong despite the growing inflationary pressure.This is helping people as purchasing power has continued to increase with new job additions to the economy. Given this situation, stocks like Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG, Campbell Soup Company CPB and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS are likely to benefit from a surge in retail sales.Retail Sales ReboundRetail sales in the United States rose a solid 3% month over month in January, beating economists’ expectations of a rise of 1.9%, the Commerce Department said on Feb 15. January’s jump follows a 1.1% decline in December. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 2.3%, which was also higher than the expectations of a jump of 0.9%.The impressive numbers reported in January were driven by sales in food services and drinking places, which surged 7.2% month over month. Sales at motor dealers and parts dealers increased 5.9%, while sales at furniture and furnishings stores climbed 4.4%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 3.5%.However, receipts at gas stations remained flat despite gas prices increasing 2.4%.E-commerce, which has been playing a key role in driving retail sales since the onset of the pandemic, once again helped the sector, as online sales rose 1.3%. E-commerce has turned out to be the most preferred mode of shopping.The pandemic saw millions shopping from home in order to maintain social distancing on fears of contracting the COVID-19 virus. This made them finally realize the safety and convenience of shopping online. The trend has continued since then and has been helping the retail sector in a major way.Moreover, people have been spending more freely over the past couple of months as inflation has been showing signs of easing. Although the consumer price index (CPI), the preferred gauge of measuring inflation, increased 0.5% in January, inflation has slowed in the prior months.Story continuesAnother reason that has been helping the retail sector is the solid job additions to the economy. The job market is still doing well despite rising inflationary pressures that have forced individuals to spend cautiously.The labor market remained resilient in 2022 and this year too, it has been good so far.The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls increased a solid 517,000, which came in above economists' expectations of a modest 187,000 increase. This follows job gains of 260,000 in December.This came as the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, its lowest level since 1969. With jobs being added at an aggressive pace, people will get more money in hand, which will help them spend more.Our ChoicesThis is thus the right opportunity to invest in retail stocks that have both a strong offline and online presence.Tapestry, Inc. is a designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally.

251,6b717bed-bd69-372e-8f7c-002e59b75c71,NVDA,2023-02-17,12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-profitable-robinhood-stocks-193755435.html,1676576275,STORY,"['HOOD', 'WMT', 'DIS', 'SBUX', 'V', 'NKE', 'NVDA', 'GOOGL', 'META']","[In this article, we take a look at 12 most profitable Robinhood stocks. If you want to see more most profitable Robinhood stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks.Robinhood is a brokerage firm that helped lower the cost of commissions for buying stocks.Because Robinhood didn't charge any commissions for buying stocks on its brokerage, several major brokerages also lowered their commissions as a result for buying stocks.As a result, many consumers have saved money in terms of commissions due to Robinhood's business model. Instead of making money on commissions, Robinhood tries to make money on other things such as margin interest.Previously, Robinhood published an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. According to the company's Q4 results, the company had 11.4 million monthly active users.Some stocks held by Robinhood users are lower quality stocks that I would stay away from.On the other hand, some popular stocks in Robinhood include some dominant blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable. Among the blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable are, in fact, some of America's most profitable companies by net income in 2022.In terms of 2023, the profits of many companies will depend on how the U.S. economy and the world economy does.In terms of how the U.S. economy does, how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further could affect U.S. economic growth in 2023. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession which could lead to earnings decreasing for many companies.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's policy depends on decision makers and also economic data.In terms of the latest economic data on inflation, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% for the month of January, which translates to an annual rise of 6.4%. The rise in the month was a little higher than economist estimates of an increase of 0.4% on the month and 6.2% on the year.Story continuesGiven the market could decline if economic data fails to meet expectations, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.FacebookPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks, we took the stocks listed on 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood and ranked them based on net income according to YCharts.We replaced The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) with Walmart Inc.

Excluding COVID-19 revenue, supplemental combined revenues at CER improved 18.6%.The year-over-year revenue surge was primarily led by the consummation of the business combination that occurred on May 27, 2022, between Quidel Corporation and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Holdings plc.Full-year revenues were $3.27 billion, reflecting a 92.3% improvement from the comparable 2021 period.Segments in DetailQuidelOrtho now derives revenues from four business units — Point-Of-Care (POC), Labs, Transfusion Medicine (TM) and Molecular Diagnostics (MDx).In the fourth quarter, POC revenues amounted to $374.7 million, reflecting a decline of 34.7% on a reported basis and down 34.4% at CER.

The gross margin contracted by a huge 2531 basis points (bps) to 51.8%.Selling, marketing and administrative expenses rose 189.8% to $213.6 million. Research and development expenses went up 146.4% year over year to $64.3 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $277.9 million surged 178.5% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $171.1 million, reflecting a 56.3% decline from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter contracted a huge 4171 bps to 19.7%.Financial PositionQuidelOrtho exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $292.9 million compared with $802.8 million at the end of 2021. Total debt (including short-term debt) at the end of 2022 was $2.64 billion compared with $0.7 million at the end of 2021.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the full-year 2022 was $885.3 million compared with $805.9 million a year ago.GuidanceQuidelOrtho has initiated its financial outlook for the full-year 2023.Total revenues are expected to lie within $2.8 billion-$3.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.77 billion.Total revenue, excluding respiratory sales, is expected to lie within $2.21 billion-$2.25 billion.  At CER, it is likely to register an improvement of 4-6%.Respiratory revenues for the full year are expected to lie within $610 million-$875 million. The respiratory revenues include COVID-related revenue of $300 million-$500 million, rapid flu revenue of $230 million-$270 million and other respiratory revenue of $80 million-$105 million.Adjusted EPS is expected to lie within $5.00-$5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $5.10.Our TakeQuidelOrtho ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. Its robust overall top-line performance was impressive. The company recorded strong revenues in the majority of its business units at CER, excluding COVID-19 revenues. Excluding COVID-19 revenues, geographical results also improved in two regions, which is impressive.Strong Recurring revenues (including reagents, service and other consumables) which were up including and excluding COVID-19 revenues and solid Instrument revenue (driven by strong cash instrument sales in QuidelOrtho’s TM business, including a few nice large wins in North America), were encouraging.Continued strength in QuidelOrtho’s comprehensive product portfolio and expanded global commercial footprint also raise optimism about the stock. The progress made by the company regarding the integration of its QuidelOrtho business is also promising.However, dismal bottom-line results and lower supplemental combined revenues are disappointing. The decline in all its business units and geographies on a reported basis is discouraging. The decline in QuickVue revenues (including COVID-19 revenues) is also worrying. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well. QuidelOrtho continued to face inflation and supply-chain challenges, raising our apprehensions.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuidelOrtho currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The decline in organic revenues was due to a 13.4% fall in contribution from COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing (COVID-19 testing).

This decline in organic revenues resulted from a 20.7% drop in contribution from COVID-19 Testing, partially offset by a 6.4% rise in Base Business. There was a 0.3% negative impact from foreign currency translation.Story continuesLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteThe company witnessed an 11.8% fall in total volume (measured by requisition) on a 13.8% decline in organic volume and acquisition volume growth of 2%. Organic volume was primarily hampered by a 14.3% drop in COVID-19 Testing, partially offset by a 0.5% rise in Base Business.Drug Development revenues fell 4.1% to $1.39 billion in the fourth quarter due to a 3.1% negative impact from foreign currency translation. There was 0.4% growth from acquisitions, offset by a 1.5% drop in organic Base Business revenues. There has been a 5% decline due to COVID-related work and the Ukraine/Russia crisis.MarginsGross margin contracted 750 basis points (bps) to 26.4% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income declined 47.9% year over year to $433.3 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 870 bps from the year-ago quarter to 11.8%.Cash PositionLabCorp exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $430 million compared with $1.47 billion at the end of 2021. Cumulative cash flow from operating activities at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.96 billion, significantly down from $3.11 billion a year ago. Additionally, cumulative free cash flow at the end of the quarter under review was $1.50 billion, down from $2.60 billion a year ago.At the end of fourth-quarter 2022, LabCorp repurchased $300.0 million of stock, representing approximately 1.4 million shares. The company’s board of directors approved an additional $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization.2023 ViewThe company provided its 2023 guidance.Total LabCorp Enterprise revenues (net of intersegment transaction eliminations, including Drug Development COVID-19 testing revenues) are expected to grow in the range of 1-4%. Base Business growth is expected in the range of 8.5-10.5%. Meanwhile, COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to decline in the range of 75-90%.Total Diagnostics revenues are expected to be down 2% to up 1.5%. Total Drug Development revenues are expected to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $14.96 billion.The company expects full-year adjusted EPS in the band of $16.00-$18.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $17.67.The company projects 2023 free cash flow figure in the range of $1-$1.2 billion.Our TakeLabCorp ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings but a revenue miss. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 revenues and adjusted EPS declined significantly. Organic revenues declined mainly due to a major decrease in COVID-19 PCR and antibody testing sales. Significant contraction of both margins is discouraging. The severe foreign exchange headwind, inflationary pressure and the ongoing Ukraine/Russia crisis continue to impact business performance.Meanwhile, the company is accelerating the planned spin-off of its Clinical Development business (announced in July) and expects it to be completed in mid-2023.Zacks Rank and Key PicksLabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

Growth in the Technology and Value-added Services business was strongest in the international business due to the strength of the Dentally cloud-based solution. Growth in North America was driven by sales of practice management software. Sales growth in the Medical business continued to be excellent, reflecting higher patient traffic to alternate care sites.However, severe currency headwinds and lower sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits affected the top line.

259,79084578-5b1b-386e-905e-556473ce1ecf,GPC,2023-02-17,Genuine Parts (GPC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-gpc-reports-next-150103849.html,1676559663,STORY,['GPC'],"[The market expects Genuine Parts (GPC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.2%.Revenues are expected to be $5.33 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.79% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts?For Genuine Parts, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Genuine Parts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of $2.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.23, delivering a surprise of +9.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Genuine Parts appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we will look at three Dividend Kings. These picks offer solid yields and safe payouts along with very impressive 50+ year track records of growing their dividends.Indeed, with recession on the horizon, investors are increasingly emphasizing quality, safety and dividends in their portfolio selections. With these Dividend Kings, investors will have access to three stocks that not only have been able to generate long-term dividend growth but also proven to be resilient in the face of adverse economic conditions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsProcter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a very popular dividend stock thanks to its remarkable track record of growing its dividend for 66 consecutive years and its popular consumer products brands.Recently, the company pruned its product portfolio in order to focus on its best brands and product lines in order to maximize profitability and long-term organic growth. Some of these leading core brands are Gillette, Tide, Charmin, Crest, Pampers, Febreze, Head &amp; Shoulders, Bounty and Oral-B. It repurchased stock with the proceeds from selling off brands, unlocking value for shareholders.Moving forward, the company should be able to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth through a combination of share repurchases, margin expansion (due to a combination of cost cuts, improved economies of scale, and price increases), and revenue growth (due to continued investments in its powerful brands and most successful products). The company may also elect to grow through strategic acquisitions like its recent $4.2 billion purchase of Merck’s global consumer health business.One of the best things about investing in PG right now is that it is a proven performer during recessions. During the Great Recession, it grew EPS from $3.04 in 2007 to $3.53 in 2010. This is largely because it commands strong competitive positions in product lines that are considered essentials. As a result, customers are very loyal to PG’s brands and prioritize purchasing its products over other, more discretionary spending when hard economic times hit.Story continuesGenuine Parts (GPC)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockGenuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is another great dividend growth stock with an impressive 66-year dividend growth streak. It has the world’s largest auto parts network, with over 10,500 locations across 17 countries. It also employs approximately 53,000 people. The company derives roughly two-thirds of its revenue from its automotive parts business. The other third comes from its revenue from its industrial parts business.Its automotive parts business is best known for its NAPA brand. Meanwhile, its industrial parts business serves primarily maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) businesses as well as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers spanning a wide range of industries such as mining, energy and health care.Moving forward, we expect the economic environment to boost demand for GPC’s services. This is because when times get tough, customers hold onto their existing cars and equipment for longer. As a result, they will likely be purchasing parts from companies like GPC. This steady performance in the face of recession is reflected in its relatively stable EPS performance during the Great Recession when it saw its EPS go from $2.98 in 2007 to $3 in 2010.GPC operates in a massive total addressable market of nearly half a trillion dollars’ worth of business. It intends to continue growing EPS at a solid clip in part by consolidating its enormous addressable market via organic market share capture and strategically acquiring smaller competitors. It can then implement its economies of scale and other competitive advantages to unlock synergies from these smaller acquisitions. Another manner in which GPC plans to grow EPS moving forward is via aggressive share repurchases.Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browserSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) has grown its dividend for 58 consecutive years. The company has been in business for over a century. Therefore, it has a long and storied history of growth and building a vaunted business network and brand power. Today it operates seven business segments: Automotive, Food Equipment, Test &amp; Measurement, Welding, Polymers &amp; Fluids, Construction Products and Specialty Products.The company’s EPS growth strategy consists of strong organic growth thanks to its strong brand power, opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases. Over the past decade, the company has reduced its shares outstanding each year. Since 2013, the share count has declined by 30%.The company also has numerous competitive advantages that help it continuously drive steady profits and EPS growth over time. These include its immense economies of scale, which give it pricing advantages as well as superior resources for investment in research and development and marketing relative to its competitors. Furthermore, it has a massive intellectual property portfolio that includes over 17,000 granted and pending patents.The company is also constantly pruning its brand and product portfolio according to the “80/20” principle. In other words, it is constantly evaluating the performance of and outlook for its brands and products. Then, it divests the 20% that rank the worst while doubling down on the best 80%. By doing this, it is constantly improving profit margins and organic growth and ensures that it is maximizing returns on invested capital.While the company is not recession-proof, it has proven to be able to sustain strong profitability during hard economic times. From 2007 to 2010, it saw its EPS move from $3.36 to $3.03. Additionally, it continued to grow its dividend each year through that process. As a result, investors who buy it today should be able to feel pretty confident in the sustainability of ITW’s dividend and dividend growth through a potential recession in the coming years.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(AP) — Hosts at Fox News had serious concerns about allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election being made by guests who were allies of former President Donald Trump, according to court filings in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the network.“Sidney Powell is lying,” about having evidence for election fraud, Tucker Carlson told a producer about the attorney on Nov. 16, 2020, according to an excerpt from an exhibit that remains under seal.The internal communication was included in a redacted summary judgment brief filed Thursday by attorneys for Dominion Voting Systems.Carlson also referred to Powell in a text as an “unguided missile,” and “dangerous as hell.” Fellow host Laura Ingraham, meanwhile, told Carlson that Powell is “a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy,” referring to former New York mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani.Sean Hannity, meanwhile, said in a deposition “that whole narrative that Sidney was pushing, I did not believe it for one second,"" according to Dominion's filing.Denver-based Dominion, which sells electronic voting hardware and software, is suing both Fox News and parent company Fox Corporation. Dominion said some Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims that Dominion had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements.Attorneys for the cable news giant argued in a counterclaim unsealed Thursday that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment. They said Dominion has advanced “novel defamation theories” and is seeking a “staggering” damage figure aimed at generating headlines, chilling protected speech and enriching Dominion’s private equity owner, Staple Street Capital Partners.“Dominion brought this lawsuit to punish FNN for reporting on one of the biggest stories of the day— allegations by the sitting President of the United States and his surrogates that the 2020 election was affected by fraud,” the counterclaim states. “The very fact of those allegations was newsworthy.”Story continuesFox attorneys also said in their own summary judgment brief that Carlson repeatedly questioned Powell’s claims in his broadcasts. “When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her,” Carlson told viewers on Nov. 19, 2020.Fox attorneys say Dominion’s own public relations firm expressed skepticism in December 2020 as to whether the network's coverage was defamatory. They also point to an email from Oct. 30, 2020, just days before the election, in which Dominion's director of product strategy and security complained that the company's products were “just riddled with bugs.”In their counterclaim, Fox attorneys wrote that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations.Fox’s counterclaim is based on New York’s “anti-SLAAP” law. Such laws are aimed at protecting people trying to exercise their First Amendment rights from being intimidated by “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPPs.“According to Dominion, FNN had a duty not to truthfully report the President’s allegations but to suppress them or denounce them as false,” Fox attorneys wrote. “Dominion is fundamentally mistaken. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side.”Fox attorneys warn that threatening the company with a $1.6 billion judgment will cause other media outlets to think twice about what they report. They also say documents produced in the lawsuit show that Dominion has not suffered any economic harm and do not indicate that it lost any customers as the result of Fox’s election coverage.Superior Court Judge Eric Davis is scheduled to preside over a trial beginning in mid-April, but granting summary judgment to either side would obviate the need for a jury trial that could stretch over five weeks.In its 192-page brief, Dominion said the judge should rule in its favor because “no reasonable juror could find in Fox’s favor on each element of Dominion’s defamation claim.” Dominion attorneys also assert that no reasonable juror could find in favor of Fox’s “neutral reportage” and “fair report” defenses.“Recounts and audits conducted by election officials across the U.S. repeatedly confirmed the election’s outcome, including specifically that Dominion’s machines accurately counted votes,"" Dominion's filing states. “That evidence alone more than suffices for summary judgment on the falsity of the claims that Dominion rigged the election and its software manipulated vote counts.”Fox News attorneys argue the network's coverage and commentary are not defamatory.""Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that Dominion could point to any statement that could be actionable defamation, this court should grant Fox News’ summary judgment motion for the independent reason that Dominion lacks clear and convincing evidence that the relevant individuals at Fox News made or published any statement with actual malice,"" the attorneys wrote.Davis ruled last month that, for the purposes of the defamation claims, he will consider Dominion to be a public figure. That means Dominion must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Fox defendants acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.Attorneys for Fox Corp. joined in the brief filed by Fox News, while also asserting that the parent company is independently entitled to summary judgment because Dominion has not produced any evidence needed to hold it liable.]"

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been less than pleasing. In fact the stock is down 30% in the last year, well below the market return.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Walt Disney share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 5.6%. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Walt Disney's revenue is actually up 16% over the last year. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Walt Disney will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.3% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 30%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.3% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

Instead of making money on commissions, Robinhood tries to make money on other things such as margin interest.Previously, Robinhood published an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase.

Among the blue chip stocks that are pretty profitable are, in fact, some of America's most profitable companies by net income in 2022.In terms of 2023, the profits of many companies will depend on how the U.S. economy and the world economy does.In terms of how the U.S. economy does, how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further could affect U.S. economic growth in 2023. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession which could lead to earnings decreasing for many companies.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's policy depends on decision makers and also economic data.In terms of the latest economic data on inflation, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5% for the month of January, which translates to an annual rise of 6.4%. The rise in the month was a little higher than economist estimates of an increase of 0.4% on the month and 6.2% on the year.Story continuesGiven the market could decline if economic data fails to meet expectations, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.FacebookPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Robinhood Stocks, we took the stocks listed on 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood and ranked them based on net income according to YCharts.We replaced The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) with Walmart Inc.

And here with our key takeaways we've got Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal. Allie, take it away.ALLIE CANAL: Hi, good morning, Brad. And it's been quite the earnings season so far. We will hear from Warner Brothers Discovery at the end of this month. But Netflix, Disney, Comcast, Paramount all painting a very particular picture of the streaming landscape. So my top three takeaways really focuses on this new streaming era. Number one, we've seen mounting streaming losses across the board, which have obviously weighed on these companies' bottom lines.However, management has guided that the end is in sight. You can look at Paramount just out this morning, missed earnings expectations, posted a $1.82 billion DTC loss in 2022. But CEO Bob Bakish did say that there will be a return to earnings growth in 2024 with direct-to-consumer losses peaking this year. Similarly, Disney said Disney+ will be profitable by the end of 2024, with Comcast adding that its Peacock service will also see peak losses in 2023. So there's this improving narrative across the sector.Another theme is more cost cuts and more revenue initiatives. Examples of this include the Netflix password sharing crackdown, the overall slowdown in content spending, price hikes, Paramount announcing on the earnings call just about an hour ago that price hikes will be coming in the third quarter on the heels of that new combo service with Showtime. And then we saw Disney laying off 7,000 employees, restructuring the entire company.And that brings me to point number three-- shifting strategies. What works before might not work now. And there seems to be more of an openness to try new things moving forward. Netflix hinting it will be open to exploring a free ad-supported--]"

II. (NYSE: FZT), a SPAC. The combined company is set to trade on Nasdaq under the “FBYD” ticker and the transaction is expected to close this year.Orlando, Florida-based Falcon’s Beyond is a theme park designer and developer formed in 2019 as a combination of Falcon’s Creative, which designs park rides, and Katmandu Group, which runs one of Spain’s most popular amusement parks. Spanish resort giant Melia Hotels is also a partner in the business.The company is led by serial entrepreneur and Executive Chairman Scott Demerau, founder of House of Katmandu theme parks, and Chief Executive Officer Cecil Magpuri, who was previously Creative Director at Universal Studios. The Fast SPAC is led by Sandy Beall, a hospitality executive best known for founding and leading the Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain for over 40 years.Before merging with Katmandu group, Falcon’s Creative developed games, digital content and attractions for clients like Universal Studios, Lego and SeaWorld for more than 20 years. These days, the company has content on Netflix and Disney is a client.Story continuesFalcon’s Beyond combines intellectual property development with parks, media and merchandising. The company brings its own proprietary and partner IPs to global markets through owned and operated theme parks, resorts, attractions, patented technologies, feature films, episodic series, consumer products and licensing.Its latest destination, Katmandu Park, a joint venture with Melia Hotels International SA, will open fully on March 15 in Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic. Much like Universal’s City Walk, a dining, retail and entertainment complex dubbed Falcon’s Central will be free to visit, next to the theme park.Here’s where the partnerships take center stage. The theme park will use characters from animated children’s program “CoComelon,” owned by Moonbug Entertainment. Moonbug is owned by former Disney executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs.As part of the partnership with Moonbug, Falcon’s will expand two of its children’s digital brands, CoComelon and Blippi, through new immersive “edutainment” experiences. The brands will also be featured at Falcon’s Central and Kids Camps.Falcon’s plans to bring several children’s television programs into the physical realm. Properties such as Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum, Dinosaur Train, Odd Squad, and Wild Kratts will be expanded in interactive environments that integrate media with hands-on exploration.The company has also formed a strategic partnership with BRON Studios to jointly roll out worldwide entertainment initiatives including feature films, episodic series, video games, live events, location-based entertainment, and Web3 activations. BRON has been instrumental in more than 120 productions, including House of Gucci, Joker, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Greyhound, and The Survivor.In addition, Falcon’s and kids-franchise company Epic Story Media are collaborating to rapidly reimagine and expand the Katmandu brand’s fantastical legends beyond a theme park experience.Falcon’s is betting investors will appreciate its pipeline of deals, including five full-concept master plans for theme parks that could generate $655 million in fees and sales total, based on the business’ historical billing averages. Resorts where the company enjoys generous tax benefits in Tenerife, Spain, and Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, will also soon follow, as part of its partnership with Melia.Falcon’s is also developing a theme park outside of Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with Qiddiya Investment Co. Falcon’s is a major designer for Qiddiya, a planned entertainment region of theme parks, sports venues including motorsport racetracks and academies for sports and the arts. Falcon’s also is in talks with New World Development Co.’s K11 mall developer to create experiential locations in Greater China.On Feb. 14, Fast Acquisition Corp. II filed an S-4, asking shareholders to approve an initial three-month extension to merger deadline, with a board option to extend by four month-to-month periods, for potential total of seven months. FZT said the revised merger terms align “equity consideration and sponsor economics of the transaction with shareholders by significantly tying both to capital raised, financial performance, and share price targets of the combined company.”As an incentive to new shareholders, 50% of all FZT shares will become convertible preferred equity paying an 8% dividend, which can be converted at $11 or will be mandatorily converted at $14.30. The convertible was designed to provide investors with downside protection.The transaction values the business at 6.7 times projected 2024 EBITDA. That reflects about $149 million in EBITDA on $455 million in revenue that year.The booming entertainment category is showing no signs of slowing. Smart investors will see a company that can turn new entertainment properties into amusement park attractions faster than the industry has historically. That’s a FastPass worth getting in on.Contact:IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.comInstagram: @ipoedgeTwitter: @ipoedge]"

If you want to see more best stocks to buy for investment, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment.While different people have different opinions on what the best stocks for investment are, a decent number of investors think the stocks of leading companies with substantial competitive advantages whose shares are generally less volatile could be good candidates.Less volatile stocks generally don't move as much as the broader stock market does because the future financial performance of less volatile stocks is arguably more predictable. There are certain times where less volatile stocks can be more volatile, however, such as during earnings.Less volatile stocks include leading consumer staples whose demand doesn't change all that much in more challenging economic times. Some less volatile stocks are conglomerates or have multiple leading brands. As a result of having multiple different businesses or multiple different brands, the overall company's results might not change as much as the results of an individual business or individual brand do.Many of the same leading stocks with generally lower betas also have fair growth prospects due to various reasons. For some companies, they might have decent growth potential in faster growing emerging markets such as India. For other companies, they might be repurchasing a lot of their stock. If a company buys back substantial shares and doesn't issue any new shares, its EPS could grow even if its overall earnings stay the same.Although they might have fairly predictable businesses, individual stocks might still underperform if a company makes a bad acquisition, for instance, or if its overall market demand isn't as strong as expected. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.In terms of 2023, many of the leading lower beta stocks have not rallied as much as the market has year to date. In some instances, the lower volatility stocks have declined year to date as individual company earnings have not be as strong as expected. Nevertheless, analysts do expect the leading consumer staples conglomerates mentioned in this article to grow in the long term.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment, we picked 10 stocks that have lower betas than the overall market and that have decent growth potential according to their EPS next 5 Year Ratio.We ranked each of the 10 stocks based on their market capitalization as of 2/15.For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Stocks to Buy for an 18 Year Old.10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment10. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX)Market Capitalization as of 2/15: $18.99 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 13.38%Consumer staple The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has a fairly high EPS growth forecast over the next 5 years of 13.38% because its trailing TTM EPS is relatively low. As a result of trailing twelve month EPS of $3.51, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has a P/E of 43.79 which is pretty high.

The Company’s forward-looking statements represent current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statements and no assurance can be given that the results described in such forward-looking statements will be achieved. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made. The forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements, many of which are outside of our control. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Any number of factors could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the following: the Company’s ability to remain profitable in a very competitive marketplace, which depends upon the Company’s ability to differentiate its products and services from those of competitors; the Company’s failure to realize assumptions and projections which may result in the need to record additional impairment charges; the effect of changes to the Company’s distribution channels for its products and the failure of significant distributors of the Company to effectively manage their inventories; the Company’s ability to control costs and failure to realize expected benefits of cost reduction and restructuring efforts and the Company’s failure to anticipate and appropriately adapt to changes or trends within the rapidly changing dental industry. Furthermore, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and may continue to be amplified by or may, in the future, be amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of varying private and governmental responses that affect our customers, employees, vendors and the economies and communities where they operate. Investors should carefully consider these and other relevant factors, including those risk factors in Part I, Item 1A, (“Risk Factors”) in the Company’s most recent Form 10-K, including any amendments thereto, and any updating information which may be contained in the Company’s other filings with the SEC, when reviewing any forward-looking statement. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors should understand it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors or risks. As such, you should not consider either the foregoing lists, or the risks identified in the Company’s SEC filings, to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”) the Company provides certain measures in this press release, described below, which are not calculated in accordance with US GAAP and therefore represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to measure its performance and may differ from those used by other companies.Management believes that these Non-GAAP measures are helpful as they provide another measure of the results of operations, and are frequently used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the Company.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and MarginAdjusted operating income (loss) is computed by excluding the following items from operating income:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the post-acquisition roll-off of fair value adjustments recorded related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.(2) Impairment related charges and other costs. These adjustments include charges related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments. Other costs include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs, and related professional service costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency, consequently restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. Other costs also include legal settlements, executive separation costs, and changes in accounting principle recorded within the period. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, this category includes costs related to the recent internal investigation and associated remediation activities which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional service fees, as well as turnover and other employee-related costs.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.(4) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales.Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Adjusted net income (loss) consists of the reported net income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude the items identified above, the related income tax impacts, and discrete income tax adjustments such as: final settlement of income tax audits, discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation, any difference between the interim and annual effective tax rate, and adjustments relating to prior periods.These adjustments are irregular in timing, and the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted ShareAdjusted earnings (loss) (EPS) per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted earnings (losses) attributable to Dentsply Sirona shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Contact InformationInvestors:Andrea DaleyVP, Investor Relations+1-704-805-1293InvestorRelations@dentsplysirona.comPress:Marion Par-WeixlbergerVP, Public Relations &amp; Corporate Communications+43 676 848414588marion.par-weixlberger@dentsplysirona.com]"

This marks the first major expansion of the Universal Studios Hollywood park since 2016, when it debuted the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an interactive Hogwarts experience.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureNintendo entered a commercial partnership with Comcast-owned Universal Parks &amp; Resorts in 2015, after a decline in video game sales spurred by the failure of the Wii U console. The move aimed to monetize the world-famous Japanese brand off the video game console screen. Super Nintendo World in Osaka, Japan, was the first video game-themed park opened by Universal before the one in Hollywood.The Osaka venue, which opened in 2021 and features similar rides as well as a life-size replica of Bowser’s castle, has so far proved a success. In the aftermath of covid-19 closures, media companies like Disney and Comcast are investing heavily in mega-profitable theme parks to offset the upfront costs of video streaming and dwindling cable subscribers. Universal is also planning to add a Super Nintendo World to its Orlando, Florida, location, by 2025.Comcast’s Universal theme park business, by the numbers$7.5 billion: Revenue for Comcast Universal’s theme park division in the 2022 fiscal year, which includes Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood, as well as the Universal Studios in Osaka, Japan.49.3%: Year-on-year revenue boost for the Comcast theme park division in 2022, increasingly one of Comcast’s most successful financial ventures.

Movie, one of 2023’s most anticipated blockbusters, everyone’s favorite plumber will defend Princess Peach’s castle from the evil Bowser reptile in an age-old battle between good and evil. The traditional Super Mario storyline will get the full Hollywood treatment, featuring the likes of Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black.The trailer has been given a tepid reception mainly due to Pratt’s ill-advised attempt at an Italian accent. The movie is a big investment for Nintendo and Universal, with an estimated budget of about $80 million. The studio hopes to avoid the fate of another Super Mario Bros. movie, the 1993 live-action adaptation featuring John Leguizamo as the titular hero. The movie flopped, posting a loss of approximately $10 million at the box office.Super Mario Bros. Movie’s marketing campaign is pulling all the stops, including a Super Bowl ad playing on 1980s nostalgia, complete with a working phone number for the made-up, Brooklyn-based plumbing company.Is augmented reality the future of theme parks?The projection of artificial graphics into the real world, known as augmented reality, has become a cornerstone of theme parks in the US and around the world. At the newly-built Super Nintendo World, Universal Studios advertises wristbands and interactive binoculars that allow guests to collect digital coins, battle virtual characters, and immerse themselves in the world of Mario and other Nintendo characters.While not as frequently discussed as virtual reality, augmented reality is already a staple of our digital world, with ubiquitous filter technology across Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media platforms. Snapchat recently announced it had more than 300,000 developers building augmented reality products for its platform, adding they have already built more than 3 million filters that have been used 5 trillion times.The next logical step in augmented reality is wearables, like the interactive binoculars that will be offered at the Nintendo theme park. While the Google Glass was famously a flop, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have all invested heavily in “mixed-reality” headsets, while the US army is trying to incorporate Microsoft’s technology into their soldier’s technical arsenal. The augmented reality innovations on display at Super Nintendo World offer a sneak peek into the future of entertainment, in theme parks and beyond.Related stories:🎮 Nintendo will open theme parks at three Universal Studios around the world💰 What to look for in Disney’s first earnings report since Iger’s return🖥️ Activision Blizzard was fined $35 million for neglecting employee complaintsMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Scott Coody: Good morning. And thank you to everyone for joining us on the call today. Last night we issued an earnings release and presentation that cover our results for the quarter and our outlook for Devon in 2023. Throughout the call today, we will make references to the earnings presentation to support prepared remarks, and these slides can be found on our website. Also joining me on the call today are Rick Muncrief, our President and CEO; Clay Gaspar, our Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer; and a few other members of our senior management team. Comments today will include plans, forecasts and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.Please take note of the cautionary language and risk factors provided in our SEC filings and earnings materials. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.Rick Muncrief : Thank you, Scott. It's great to be here this morning. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. On the call today, I will cover three key topics: our record-setting performance in 2022, the strong outlook we have for 2023, and the cadence of our capital and production in the upcoming year. Now to begin with, I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 6 and 7, which cover our results for the past year. As you can see, for Devon Energy, 2022 was another year of outstanding accomplishments. We achieved all the capital objectives associated with our disciplined operating plan. We delivered the best financial performance in our company's prestigious 52-year history. And we took important steps during the year to strengthen the depth and quality of our asset portfolio.Story continuesThe slides on Slide 6 show a great visualization of the solid execution we delivered over the course of 2022. Production per share advanced by 9% year-over-year. This growth resulted from a combination of record oil production that has more than doubled since 2020 to accretive acquisitions and timely stock buybacks. Our streamlined cost structure captured a full benefit of favorable commodity prices, expanding per unit margins year-over-year. Returns on capital employed set a new company record at 39% for the year. This impressive return profile outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by a substantial margin, and this strong capital efficiency translated into free cash flow reaching an all-time high of $6 billion in 2022, more than doubling the previous year.I want to congratulate the entire team at Devon for these accomplishments in 2022. This type of operational excellence and financial performance differentiates Devon as one of the premier energy companies in the U.S. Another key highlight for 2022 was the market-leading cash returns we deliver to investors. On Slide 7, we have included a comparison of our total cash payout that reached around 10% for the year versus other opportunities in the market. As you can see in the red portion of the bar, Devon's dividend payout was more than double that of the energy sector and vastly superior to every sector in the S&amp;P 500. However, I want to be quick to add that we are not just a high-yielding dividend story, we are also compounding per share growth for investors through the execution of our $2 billion share repurchase program.By upsizing this buyback authorization twice during the year, we reduced our outstanding share count by 4% since program inception and security shares as a substantial discount to current trading levels. We also supplemented per share growth in 2022 by deploying a portion of our excess cash toward taking advantage of unique M&amp;A opportunities. These acquisitions in the Williston and Eagle Ford were highly complementary to our existing acreage, and we secured and met an attractive and accretive valuation and capture top-tier oil resource in the best part of these prolific fields. While tough to come by, these transactions successfully demonstrate another way, our plan can create value for shareholders. On Slide 11, as we shift our focus to 2023, I want to be clear that there's no change to our disciplined strategy.At Devon, we are driven by per share value creation, not the pursuit of produced volumes. For the upcoming year, we have designed a consistent capital program to sustain production, deliver high returns on capital employed and generate significant free cash flow that can be harvested for shareholders. Now let's run through some of the highlights of our 2023 outlook. Beginning with production, we expect volumes to build throughout 2023, to reach an average of 643,000 to 663,000 BOE per day for the full year, of which approximately half is oil. Combined with the tailwinds from share repurchases and our two well-timed acquisitions, our volumes on a per share basis are on track to deliver an attractive high single-digit growth rate once again in 2023.The capital investment required to deliver this production profile is expected to range from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion with these capital requirements being self-funded at pricing levels as low as a $40 WTI oil price. This low breakeven funding level showcases the durability of our business model and positions us with an attractive free cash flow yield in 2023 that screens as much as 2x higher than other key indices in the market. With this strong free cash flow, we will continue to prioritize the funding of our dividend, which includes an 11% hike to our fixed dividend payout beginning in March. We will also have plenty of excess cash after the dividend to evaluate opportunistic share buybacks or take steps to further improve our balance sheet.Lastly, on Slide 12, I would like to end today's comments with a few key thoughts on the trajectory of our capital spending and production profile as we progress through 2023. Beginning with capital, we planned for spending to be slightly elevated in the first half of the year due to the addition of a temporary fourth frac crew in the Delaware Basin. This elevated completion activity in the Delaware is expected to be wrapped up by midyear, resulting in reduced capital spending over the second half of 2023. Looking specifically at first quarter production, we expect volumes to approximate 635,000 BOE per day. Our production during the quarter is expected to be temporarily limited by three factors: first, due to the timing of activity, we expect to bring online around 90 gross-operated wells in the first quarter.This will be our lowest quarterly amount for the year. However, activity does ramp up from here with roughly 15% more wells online per quarter over the remainder of 2023 compared to the first quarter. Another factor impacting near-term production is infrastructure downtime in the Delaware Basin due to a temporary outage at a compressor station in the Stateline area, along with some minor third-party midstream interruptions in the area. We estimate these outages will limit first quarter volumes by around 10,000 BOE per day. However, we expect to fully resolve these issues and resume operation by the end of the quarter. Lastly, our forecast is also assuming that we elect to reject ethane at several processing facilities across our portfolio in the first quarter.This is expected to limit volumes by roughly 10,000 BOE per day during the quarter. The key takeaway here is that while our first quarter production will be held back a bit due to timing of activity and infrastructure, we do expect volumes to fully recover and increase over the remaining few quarters of 2023 to an average of roughly 660,000 BOE per day. So in summary, since we first unveiled the industry's very first cash return pointing mark in late 2020, we have created tremendous amount of value for our shareholders. 2021 was a great year, 2022 was one for the record books and 2023 is shaping up to be another excellent year for Devon. The outlook beyond 2023 is also exceptionally bright given my belief that we are still in the early stages of a multiyear energy upcycle.This conviction is anchored by supplying constraints from a decade of global underinvestment, ongoing sanctions on Russian production, a generational low in OPEC spare capacity, fiscal discipline among U.S. producers and the inevitable rise in demand for our products as global economies normalize and grow post-COVID. I fully expect this favorable supply and demand set up to be another catalyst for our energy appreciation or equity appreciation as more investors rediscover highly profitable and value-oriented names like Devon. With that, I will now turn the call over to Clay to cover a few operational results and more details regarding our capital activity in 2023. Clay?Photo by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashClay Gaspar : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In addition to our strong 2022 financial results, Devon also continued a run of strong operational execution as well. As you can see on Slide 14, this was evidenced by several noteworthy accomplishments including a new all-time high for oil production that was underpinned by another year of world-class well productivity in the Delaware. Devon's oil-weighted production mix, coupled with our low-cost asset base, allowed us to capture record margins and maintain low reinvestment rates of just over 30% of cash flow. We also efficiently expanded our resource base in 2022 with proved reserves advancing 12% through the combination of strong drilling results and by seamlessly integrating two property acquisitions during the year.Flipping to Slide 15. You can see that these strong operating results in '22 also place us in the top echelon of capital efficiency for the entire industry, differentiating Devon in this crowded and competitive space. These operational achievements across every phase of the business demonstrate the power of Devon's advantaged asset portfolio, the success of our rigorous capital allocation process and the quality of our people to extract the most value out of these assets through superior execution. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I plan to discuss the key capital objectives and catalyst of our '23 operating plan. For '23, we plan to maintain a very similar activity level as compared to the fourth quarter of '22, which was the first full quarter of operations with our recently acquired assets in the Williston Basin and Eagle Ford.Overall, we plan to run consistently 25 rigs throughout the year, resulting in approximately 400 new wells placed online in 2023. Turning to Slide 16. Once again, the Delaware Basin will be the top funded asset in our portfolio, representing roughly 60% of our total capital budget for this year. To execute on this plan, we will operate 16 rigs across our acreage footprint with the sweet spots in Southern Lea and Eddy Counties in the Stateline area of Texas, receiving most of the funding. Approximately 90% of our capital will be allocated towards high-return development activity in the Upper Wolfcamp and Bone Spring while the remaining 10% will be allocated towards delineating upside opportunities in a deeper Wolfcamp that will add to the depth and quality of our inventory in the basin.Importantly, we expect overall well productivity from this program to be very consistent with the high-quality wells we have brought online over the past few years. We are also well positioned to maximize value for our production in the Delaware for the upcoming year. The marketing team has done an excellent job of diversifying across multiple transportation outlets and sales points allowing us to avoid many of the takeaway constraints in the basin. Looking specifically at the gas volumes, approximately 95% of our gas in the Delaware is protected by either firm takeaway constraints -- excuse me, contracts, or Gulf Coast by regional basis swaps. With oil production, we expect our revenue to benefit from access to premium Brent pricing through Pin Oak's export terminal in Corpus Christi.This advanced pricing, combined with low LOE plus GP&amp;T cost structure of around $7 per BOE will drive another year of strong margins and excellent free cash flow from this franchise asset. And lastly, on this slide, I would like to provide a few more thoughts on our first quarter infrastructure downtime in the Delaware. As pointed out on the map, in late January, we had a fire at one of our compressor stations in the Stateline area that severely damaged the electrical system and the unit. The station is our largest operated compressor facility in the basin with capacity of 90 million cubic feet per day and is a key component to our centralized gas lift operations in the surrounding area. We have secured necessary replacement equipment and the team is currently on site repairing the facility.With this disruption and other third-party midstream downtime in the area, we expect to have a negative production impact of 10,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. With the quick reaction time and the team's focus on safety and recovery, we expect to have this facility back up and the affected production fully restored by mid-March, and we do not expect to have any negative production impacts drag into the second quarter. Turning to Slide 17 and moving on to the Eagle Ford. The team has done a great job integrating the Validus acquisition into our operations resulting in our fourth quarter production nearly doubling to 68,000 BOE per day. With this increased scale, the Eagle Ford will play a much bigger role in our capital allocation in the upcoming year, accounting for just over 15% of our total capital spend.During the year, we plan to run a steady 3-rig program with 70% of the activity deployed towards developing our recently acquired acreage in Karnes County with the remaining capital invested in our JV partner, in DeWitt County. Overall, this development-oriented activity is designed to maintain steady production in 2023. Looking beyond the production trajectory, a key catalyst for this asset in the upcoming year will be the continued appraisal of resource upside from tighter redevelopment spacing and refracs. Early results indicate there's a lot more oil to be recovered from this prolific play over time. As we get more data points, I expect to provide more commentary on this important resource expansion catalyst in the near future. Moving to the Anadarko Basin.In 2022, the team's approach of wider well spacing and larger completions design consistently delivered triple-digit returns with the benefit of our $100 million carry with Dow. As we look ahead to 2023, I expect continued value creation as we plan to deploy a steady program of 4 operated rigs once again carried by Dow. This program is expected to result in around 40 new wells placed online, focused on primarily the co-development of the Meramec and the Woodford formations in the condensate window of the play. The carried returns of these projects will once again be very strong, allowing us to maintain a steady production profile throughout the year while harvesting significant amounts of free cash flow. For both the Williston and the Powder River Basins, I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous job our field personnel did in fighting through extremely challenging weather conditions over the past few months.While operations in the fourth quarter were certainly slowed due to these artic conditions, the production from the business was resilient, collectively averaging 80,000 BOE per day between these assets in the Williston and the Powder River Basin. Looking ahead to 2023, approximately 10% of our capital spend will be deployed across these two plays resulting in approximately 50 new wells placed online during the year. Approximately 2/3 of the Rockies capital activity will reside in the Williston Basin. In 2023, the capital objectives for this asset are to efficiently sustain production through low-risk infill drilling, evaluate resource upside with a handful of refrac test, and generate around $700 million of cash flow at today's pricing. In the Powder, our objective is designed to build upon the 3-mile lateral success from last year by taking the next step in the progression of the Niobrara with spacing tests of up to 4 wells per unit.These pilots would not only help us better understand spacing but also help us inform optimal landing zones and completion designs. The key takeaway here is that Powder is one of the few emerging oil plays in North America, and we have a 300,000-acre net position in the core of the oil fairway providing Devon an important oil growth catalyst for the future. Overall, we're very excited about the prospects in 2023. I believe with the high-quality slate of projects we have lined up for the upcoming year, we expect to continue to deliver top-tier capital efficiency that investors have become accustomed to. We're also well positioned to refresh and add our depth of inventory as we execute on these programs in 2023. A good visual reminder of Devon's depth of inventory and upside potential is on Slide 18.I've covered this topic at length during previous calls, so I won't go through the details today, but I do want to emphasize two key takeaways from this slide. First, we have identified roughly 12 years of high-return development inventory evaluated at mid-cycle prices. This inventory positions us to deliver highly competitive results for the foreseeable future. And secondly, I want to highlight that this inventory does not fall off a cliff at the end of year 12. We expect to systematically refresh this inventory over time as we successfully characterize and derisk the many upside opportunities that exist across our diverse set of assets. And lastly, on Slide 19, we are continuing to make significant strides our environmental performance as outlined in our recently published sustainability report.This comprehensive report details Devon's aggressive mid- and long-term ESG targets, including those highlighted on the right side of the slide as well as meaningful steps that we've taken towards meeting these targets. Our actions demonstrate the priority we have placed on long-term carbon reduction intensity of our operations. I'm really proud of the team's commitment to doing business in the right way, which means balancing three mandates: first, providing the critical energy to power the world's economy; second, provide compelling and sustainable returns to our investors; and third, do all of this in an environmentally conscious way. You can expect Devon to continue to raise the bar on all three of these imperatives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review.Jeff?Jeff Ritenour : Thanks, Clay. I'd like to spend my time today discussing the highlights of our financial performance in 2022 and the capital allocation priorities for our free cash flow as we head into 2023. A good place to start is with a review of Devon's 2022 financial performance, where operating cash flow totaled $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, an 18% increase versus the year ago period. This level of cash flow funded all capital requirements and resulted in $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the quarter. For the full year 2022, free cash flow reached $6 billion, which is the highest amount Devon has ever delivered in a year and is a powerful example of the financial results our cash return business model can deliver.Turning your attention to Slide 8. With this significant stream of free cash flow, a unique component of our financial strategy is our ability and willingness to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through our fixed plus variable dividend framework. Under this framework, Devon's dividend payout more than doubled in 2022 to a record high of $5.17 per share. Based on our strong fourth quarter financial performance, we announced a fixed-plus-variable dividend of $0.89 per share that is payable in March and includes the benefit of our 11% raise to the fixed dividend. Another priority for our free cash flow is the execution of our ongoing $2 billion share repurchase program. On Slide 9, you can see that we upsized this buyback authorization twice during the year and we bought back $1.3 billion of stock at prices well below the current market level.Over the past two quarters, our buyback activity has been limited given the large cash outlays associated with our recent acquisitions and our preference to rebuild cash balances to optimize our financial flexibility. As we head into 2023, we expect to be active buyers of our stock, especially if we see trading weakness relative to our peers. On Slide 10, I'd like to give a brief update on our efforts to improve the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, our cash balances increased by $144 million to total $1.5 billion. With this increased liquidity, Devon exited the quarter with a very healthy net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only 0.5 turn. Our strong investment-grade financial position provides us the opportunity to return more free cash flow to shareholders and be less aggressive on debt reduction.Moving forward, we'll look to retire debt as it comes due, utilizing our healthy cash balance. Our next debt maturity comes due in August of this year totaling $242 million. We will have additional opportunities to pare down debt with maturities coming due in 2024 and 2025 as well. And finally, I'd like to highlight the excellent return on capital employed we delivered in 2022. As Rick touched on earlier, we achieved a company record 39% return on capital employed during the year. Importantly, even with today's lower commodity price environment, we expect to deliver another fantastic result with return on capital employed projected in excess of 25% based on our provided guidance and current strip pricing. This showcases the durability of our financial model to deliver highly competitive returns through the cycle.With that, I'll now turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.Rick Muncrief : Thank you, Jeff. Great job. To wrap up our prepared remarks today, I want to reinforce that at Devon, we are unwavering in our focus to deliver differentiated results for our stakeholders, including our shareholders and employees. To meet these high standards, it all begins with our commitment to be a financially disciplined company that delivers high returns on invested capital, attractive per share growth and large cash returns to shareholders. To achieve these financial goals, we have carefully assembled a long-duration resource base that has high graded to the very best plays on the U.S. cost curve. This resource depth, coupled with the execution capabilities of our team, position us as a premier energy company that can deliver sustainable results through the cycle.Since the merger announcement in 2020, we have delivered on exactly what we promised to do with this disciplined operating model and I expect more of the same in 2023. While we will be slowed down a bit in the first quarter by an unfortunate outage, the pathway to recover is well defined, communicated and the trajectory of our business will only strengthen as we go through the year. Overall, 2023 is going to be another really good year for Devon. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Scott for Q&amp;A.Scott Coody : Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&amp;A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow up. This allows us to get to more of your questions today on the call.

286,09e5f8a4-1af2-3b91-bc0a-c800cdab75d0,URI,2023-02-17,These 4 Measures Indicate That United Rentals (NYSE:URI) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-measures-indicate-united-rentals-110052845.html,1676631652,STORY,['URI'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for United Rentals What Is United Rentals's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of December 2022, United Rentals had US$11.2b of debt, up from US$9.55b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. Net debt is about the same, since the it doesn't have much cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is United Rentals' Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, United Rentals had liabilities of US$2.45b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$14.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$106.0m as well as receivables valued at US$2.26b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$14.8b.United Rentals has a very large market capitalization of US$32.0b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Story continuesUnited Rentals has net debt to EBITDA of 3.1 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. On the plus side, its EBIT was 7.6 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 3.1. Importantly, United Rentals grew its EBIT by 41% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if United Rentals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, United Rentals produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 74% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThe good news is that United Rentals's demonstrated ability to grow its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that United Rentals takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for United Rentals  that you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, United Rentals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while James Hardie has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that URI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.29, while JHX has a forward P/E of 15.77. We also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.69. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. JHX currently has a PEG ratio of 5.61.Another notable valuation metric for URI is its P/B ratio of 4.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, JHX has a P/B of 6.08.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help URI earn a Value grade of A, while JHX has been given a Value grade of C.URI sticks out from JHX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that URI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

288,adf1f341-2c13-3bd6-b882-0cd5a96c17fa,URI,2023-02-17,7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy in February,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-great-growth-stocks-buy-110030242.html,1676372430,STORY,"['TMUS', 'CSGP', 'MELI', 'URI', 'LLY', 'HAL']","[Although macro uncertainty continues to loom over the stock market, don’t view this as a sign to sit on the sidelines. If you are investing for the long haul, scores of strong opportunities are out there, including growth stocks to buy.Yes, with the rise in interest rates since last year, it’s been a challenging time for growth. Yet, while lower-quality growth stocks may continue to be affected by rising rates, and other, more company-specific challenges, this isn’t the case with the high-quality names in this category.Whether due to the strength of their respective managements, and/or because of factors such as secular growth trends, these stocks can not merely survive, but thrive, in this changing economic environment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what are some of the best growth stocks to buy today? Consider these seven. Each one is poised to be a long-term winner and currently earns either an A or B rating in Portfolio Grader.CEGConstellation Energy$86.57CSGPCoStar Group$76.89HALHalliburton$39.56LLYEli Lilly$347.52MELIMercadoLibre$347.52 TMUST-Mobile US$146.23URIUnited Rentals$458.19Constellation Energy (CEG)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockSpun off from Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) a year ago, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is technically classified as a utilities stock. However, it differs from regulated utilities such as its former corporate parent.Rather, Constellation generates electricity for sale in the competitive retail energy market. This business model is of course riskier than the traditional utilities business, yet with this risk comes greater opportunity for growth. That’s the story here with CEG stock. Earnings per share (or EPS) are expected to grow by 46.7% this year, and 21.6% next year.On a longer timeframe, Constellation is well-positioned to benefit from improving sentiment for nuclear power. An increasing number of policymakers around the world are looking to nuclear power as the key to transition away from fossil fuels. Trading at a reasonable 28.9 times forward earnings, CEG earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.Story continuesCoStar Group (CSGP)An image of a magnifying glass zooming in on the CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP) logoSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWashington, D.C.-based CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is a diversified real estate services company.Best known for its public-facing platforms such as ApartmentFinder.com, LoopNet and BizBuySell, the company also provides information and analysis services to the commercial real estate industry.Sure, given the current situation with commercial real estate, I admit it may seem odd to consider CSGP stock one of the best growth stocks to buy. After all, isn’t commercial real estate facing numerous headwinds right now? Yes, but given its subscription-based revenue model, and the strong need for its services, CoStar could stay resilient, despite the near-term weakness in the industry.Long-term, with its deep economic moat and other advantages, the company has a strong chance of continuing to grow at an above-average pace. This will enable B-rated CSGP to sustain its high valuation (51.6 times earnings) and climb up to higher prices.Halliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comGiven the strong rise in energy prices over the past year, it’s not surprising that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock has performed well over this timeframe.Shares in the oilfield equipment and services firm are up by more than 20% in the past twelve months.But don’t consider HAL stock to be a “one and done” situation. If you’ve yet to enter a position in this strong growth opportunity, it’s not too late to do so. As seen in the company’s latest earnings results, there is strong demand for its products/services, which makes sense given that fossil fuel prices are still at elevated levels.As these trends continue, expect Halliburton to stay on an upward trajectory. In addition to solid appreciation potential, there’s ample dividend growth potential with this B-rated energy stock. The company recently raised its quarterly payout by 33%, giving HAL a forward dividend yield of 1.64%.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIn recent weeks, enthusiasm for Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has waned. A top performer among pharma stocks during 2022, investors have shifted toward a more cautious stance with the stock lately.Yet, as I put it recently, instead of following the crowd out of LLY stock, the best move is to ignore the worrywarts, and take advantage of this pullback. For one, investors have likely overreacted to the latest sales numbers for Mounjaro, arguably the company’s most promising new drug.Between the fact that Eli Lilly is still ramping up production, and the strong chance this type 2 diabetes treatment also receives regulatory approval for use as an obesity treatment, Mounjaro still has a shot at becoming a “mega-blockbuster” drug, generating tens of billions in annual sales. Along with other growth catalysts, and there’s plenty that could shift sentiment back to bullish for this A-rated pharma stock.MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comOver the past decade, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has been one of the top growth stocks to buy and hold. Shares in the Uruguay-based company, a dominant player in the Latin American e-commerce market, are up more than thirteen-fold during this time.That said, MELI stock was hit by last year’s market downturn. While rallying more recently, shares remain down around 44% below their all-time closing high. I can understand why you may think MELI’s glory days are long behind it. However, while future gains may come in more gradually, I wouldn’t write off MercadoLibre just yet.As seen in its most recently released quarterly results, MercadoLibre continues to report above-average levels of revenue and earnings growth.Long-term forecasts call for earnings to rise nearly four times estimated 2022 earnings by 2025. Once economic and market conditions normalize, this B-rated stock will be on its way to higher prices.T-Mobile US (TMUS)Source: ShutterstockAmong wireless carriers in the United States, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) ranks third in terms of market share. However, among telecom stocks, TMUS has been one of the better-performing names in the space.TMUS stock is up by double-digits over the past year. This company’s main rivals have delivered a much less stellar performance during this time. Yet even as T-Mobile contends with issues such as a data breach, and as one sell-side analyst (MoffettNathanson’s Craig Moffett) warns of “growth deceleration,” don’t assume it’s all middling returns from here for this B-rated telecom stock.Growth may slow in the coming year, but T-Mobile is guiding for between 5 million and 5.5 million subscriber additions this year. That’s not all. The company also anticipates billions in additional cost-savings stemming from its 2020 merger with Sprint. Both these factors leave TMUS well-positioned to materially increase earnings in the next few years.United Rentals (URI)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for United Rentals (URI).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) may at first seem like just a value stock, with a low valuation that signals the market’s low confidence in its future results. Given the current economic slowdown, you may assume that this equipment rental company is facing more challenging times ahead.However, take a closer look at URI stock, and it’s clear that isn’t the case. Rather than being a value stock, at risk of becoming a “value trap,” URI is instead one of the top growth stocks to buy. As demand for its services remains robust, earnings are expected to grow at a steady pace between now and 2025.This continued earnings growth could keep URI stock (B-rated in Portfolio Grader) in growth mode for years to come. In addition, the company’s recent initiation of a dividend (1.51% forward yield), plus planned share repurchases, will help boost total returns.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in TMUS.

If you want to see more high growth AI stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.OpenAI's ChatGPT has taken the world by storm.In just five days, the AI chat app reached 1 million users, and in two months since its launch, ChatGPT has gained 100 million users, making it arguably the fastest growing internet consumer app in history.While it makes mistakes, ChatGPT has offered a lot of utility to a lot of people.Even tech leaders are impressed.When it came to ChatGPT, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this month, ""When was the last time we saw a piece of technology that is so versatile that it can solve problems and surprise people in so many ways so often? It can write a poem of course, it could fill out a spreadsheet, it can write a SQL query and do a SQL query, it can write python code, it can write Verilog. And if it can't do it today, of course it will be able to do it someday. So the fact that you have this tool that can do all these different things has really surprised a lot of people around the world. Now, for a lot of people who have been working on this, we have been waiting for this moment. This is the iPhone moment, if you will, of artificial intelligence.""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates also said recently that ChatGPT 'will change our world'.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, could benefit from ChatGPT's success given it invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and another $10 billion in the company this year.OpenAI also uses Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, for a lot of its processing. If ChatGPT continues to grow, the company's demand for Microsoft Azure will likely continue to increase too.Microsoft is also incorporating ChatGPT into its search engine, Bing, to potentially gain market share from Google.Similarly, a lot of other big tech companies also have substantial AI growth potential in the future given how transformative the industry could be.Story continuesThe technology industry can change very quickly where companies can gain and lose market share in a short amount of time. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Photo by mahdis mousavi on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy, we took 10 stocks with competitive advantages that have substantial growth opportunities in AI in the future and we ranked them based on their market capitalization.High growth in this article means a company has meaningful growth potential in AI in the long term.We nevertheless include the EPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years ratio as a datapoint for each company.For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment.10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $122.06 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 6.67%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has growth potential in AI given it's one of the leaders in quantum computing. If successful, quantum computing could be faster than conventional computers at certain computing tasks and that faster speed could make AI even more useful as a result.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) explains its quantum business, ""This nascent technology is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s most powerful classical supercomputers cannot solve and never will. Our community of clients and partners comprises 210+ Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions, national labs, and startups. With the largest fleet of 20+ of the most powerful quantum systems in the world, we are aiming to turn the world’s most challenging problems into valuable opportunities.""Given quantum computers are still in their development stage, however, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is not expected to grow very quickly in the next five years given its EPS growth forecast next 5 year ratio of 6.67%. In the long term, the company does have potential if it successfully maintains its leadership in quantum computing.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a stock with meaningful AI growth potential in the future.9. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $144.52 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 15.41%SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a leading enterprise software company that has incorporated AI into its software to potentially help its customers. Among other things, the company offers AI-powered insights, recommendations, and more in its SAP applications. If SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) can successfully offer more value with AI in its products, the company could potentially realize higher demand in the long term. As of February 16, the company has a forward P/E ratio of 17.45 and a market capitalization of $144.52 billion, ranking #9 on our list of 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.8. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $236.52 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 8.35%Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has AI growth potential given it is a leading enterprise software company that could realize higher demand if it successfully incorporates AI into its software in a way that offers more value to its customers. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) also has a cloud business that could potentially realize higher demand if AI processing needs increase. One of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)'s cloud business customers is TikTok which uses AI to make better suggestions.7. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $262.44 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 29.80%ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leading semiconductor equipment producer that is on the cutting edge in its field. Considering AI apps require computer processing that uses semiconductors, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) could realize higher demand if AI processing increases faster than expected. Although shares currently trade for a P/E ratio of 43.18, analysts expect the company to grow EPS substantially over the next 5 years.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.6. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Market Capitalization as of 2/16: $447.07 billionEPS Growth Forecast Next 5 Years: 3.63%Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a lot of potential in AI given it has billions of monthly users it could offer AI services to. If it is successful in terms of making its metaverse products, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could also potentially incorporate AI into the metaverse and potentially sell more high margin services as a result. Although analysts only see the company growing EPS by an average of 3.63% a year over the next 5 years, the company has substantially higher growth potential in the long term if it is successful in the metaverse and AI.With its market capitalization of $447.07 billion as of 2/16, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks #6 on our list of 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are stocks with meaningful growth potential in AI in the future.Click to continue reading and see 5 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Suggested articles:10 Most Advanced Countries in Nuclear Fusion25 Largest Ports in the World15 Fastest Growing Countries in AsiaDisclosure: None. 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The bid equates to $126.14 per share based on Public Storage's closing price on Wednesday.Public Storage has received ""overwhelmingly positive feedback from both companies' shareholders"" since announcing its bid, the company told Reuters on Thursday.""We are encouraged that Life Storage appears, for the first time, willing to shift towards good-faith discussions regarding our proposal and we look forward to concrete next steps in that direction,"" the Glendale, California-based firm said.A deal between the two real estate investment trusts (REIT) would consolidate a fragmented industry and create a self-storage giant that would have the scale to tackle competition in a post COVID-19 world where demand for self-storage properties has waned as people have started returning to big cities.Public Storage said on Feb. 5 that Life Storage had rejected an offer under similar terms in January, forcing the company to make its approach public.

291,94ef0bb5-91e9-3570-b387-5c2560adfa69,PSA,2023-02-17,What's in Store for Public Storage (PSA) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-public-storage-psa-152303991.html,1676560983,STORY,"['PSA', 'PSA-PM', 'VICI', 'PK']","[Public Storage PSA is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 21 after market close. Both its quarterly revenues and core funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to have seen year-over-year increases.In the last reported quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.98% in terms of core FFO per share. Results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth alongside an improvement in the realized annual rent per occupied square foot. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions.Over the last four quarters, Public Storage surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 2.09%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Public Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key FactorsPublic Storage is likely to have gained from its solid presence in key cities and high brand value in the fourth quarter. PSA is also likely to have benefited from its technological advantage amid favorable market fundamentals and maintained a healthy balance sheet position.In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In the third quarter, Public Storage acquired 24 self-storage facilities comprising 1.7 million net rentable square feet of area for $250.6 million.Following Sep 30, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy 33 self-storage facilities spanning 1.7 million net rentable square feet of space across six states for $262.6 million. Such acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to have stoked the company’s growth during the period under consideration.Amid these, Public Storage is likely to have seen growth in revenues in the quarter to be reported. Also, PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with adequate liquidity to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. This is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.08 billion. This calls for a 16.75% year-over-year increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $1.01 billion. This suggests an increase from the $869.72 million witnessed in the year-ago period. Quarterly revenues from ancillary operations are presently projected at $58.54 million, ahead of the $54.60 million registered in the comparable period last year.PSA’s activities during the quarter under review were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter core FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $3.99 in the past month. It also calls for 12.71% year-over-year growth.However, with the impact of the pandemic abating, vacancy is likely to increase. Furthermore, there is a development boom of self-storage units in several markets. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition. Rising interest rates add to its woes.For the full-year 2022, PSA projected core FFO per share in the range of $15.35-$15.75. The company’s full-year assumption is backed by 13.5-15% growth in same-store revenues, a 6% to 8% rise in same-store expenses and a 15.4% to 18.0% expansion in same-store NOI. Further, the company expects $800 million in acquisitions and $250 million in development openings.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the core FFO per share is pegged at $15.75. The figure indicates a 21.81% increase year over year on 22.16% year-over-year growth in revenues to $4.17 billion.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Public Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.PSA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks from the REIT sector — VICI Properties Inc. VICI and Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK — that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.VICI Properties, slated to release quarterly numbers on Feb 23, has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.

(NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 15th of May, with investors receiving $0.70 per share. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.8%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. At the time of the last dividend payment, Hasbro was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 169% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.EPS is set to grow by 5.5% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 93% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. Hasbro hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.Hasbro's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Hasbro's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Hasbro is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Davidson &amp; Co. Linda Bolton-Weiser joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the challenges Hasbro is facing amid missing on fourth-quarter earnings, quantifying the amount of inventory that needs to be worked down, investor sentiment, and the outlook for profit growth.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Hasbro seeing a tough quarter as it misses analyst estimates on the top and bottom line. However, the toymaker expecting its operating cash flow is expected to nearly double in 2023.For more on insights on the toy industry is Linda Bolton-Weiser, D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst. Good to have you on the show here. So obviously a lot of optimism here coming out of Hasbro despite this, what they saw with the earnings here. Talk about the credibility here, especially when it comes to this CEO, and how you think that actually plays into these expectations going forward.LINDA BOLTON-WEISER: [COUGH] Excuse me.Yes, Chris Cox, the CEO of Hasbro, does have a bit to prove. The company is under pressure. There's some activist involvement. And so the company is under the gun. But really, some of the challenges that they're facing certainly are very similar to the challenges that Mattel is facing. So basically the expectation is for a really down first half of 2023 and then resumption of growth in the second half.And, of course, the real big problem here, it's not so much toy demand. The problem is inventory, both at the company level as well as at the channel level. That has to be worked down. And I think investors are getting some comfort that there's some numbers that's been put around to quantify the amount of inventory that needs to be worked down.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we know that, I mean, expectations were already tempered after that January preannouncement, but then to then have this happen with Hasbro as well, what does that do in terms of how you're viewing the health of Hasbro?LINDA BOLTON-WEISER: Well, you know, Hasbro has some company-specific challenges in addition to the macro challenges. So they do need to work through improving the profitability of certain toy brands, and one thing they've done is to license out the rights to those. So they're getting rid of toy brands that are actually losing money for them. Also, they've talked about they're going to divest portions of the entertainment business. That's been a very hard business to project for analysts. And they have some work to do on the cost reduction.Story continuesSo there's a lot of things that they have to do, but most of all-- and the CEO emphasized this-- they do need to gain share, market share, in toys in 2023 because the toy market's probably going to be about flattish.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we did see that Chris Cox did talk about delivering this first billion-dollar brand in the form of Magic The Gathering and said that they did grow in some key investment areas, including licensing, as you mentioned there, direct to consumer, and also what they saw with operating profit margins. How much does that play into the growth story when you think about the digital landscape of gaming that they are also pushing into?LINDA BOLTON-WEISER: Yes, well, the crux of the bull case for Hasbro is that they have this Wizards and digital-gaming business, which is really a significant portion of their revenue and profit. And that has, oh, 30% plus margins, whereas the toy business has a 10% margin. So when you have higher growth in digital and Wizards segment versus toys, then you're going to have a natural margin lift over time.So that's really the long-term bull thesis for Hasbro, and I do think that can continue to work out. And even in 2023, they are guiding to 50 to 70 basis points of operating-margin expansion. So they're getting margin expansion even in a tough year in 2023.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And obviously we saw, as with Mattel as well, talking about that tough macroeconomic environment, and we know that their gross margins were affected by their inventory-management efforts as well. How would you compare the two when you think of the offerings that they both have?LINDA BOLTON-WEISER: Well Mattel I would say is in a little bit stronger of a footing in their toy business because it's not really a turnaround. They've had a pattern, a trend of pretty steady market-share gains. So in that sense, Mattel has been outperforming the industry, whereas Hasbro has been underperforming the industry because of some share losses. So that's kind of the key difference.And I would say that, in general the revenue decline for Mattel in the first half of 2023 is a little bit less than Hasbro. Hasbro is more in the 20s type of revenue decline, and Mattel is more like in the 15% to 20% range-- a little bit less of a decline for Mattel.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then as we look ahead as we look at the toy industry-- because I know you said it's not so much a demand issue-- that it's not about the demand issue, that it's really about inventory management and things like that. What is your outlook then for the rest of the year for the toy industry, and who do you think is really going to come out on top in terms of how they manage their inventory?LINDA BOLTON-WEISER: Well, industry experts, the companies themselves and other industry insiders are calling for a flattish market, and this is after several years of very solid growth and two years of double-digit revenue growth. This is retail sales growth. And then 2022 was flattish and 2023 flattish.But in general, the industry is healthy. So even when consumer wallets are pinched a little bit here, the industry is really not declining. It's kind of flattish. So that's good news that consumers will always still buy toys.But, you know, again, the challenge here is for Hasbro to try to gain market share. Mattel has been gaining more share. And so I have buy ratings on both Mattel and Hasbro, but I tell investors that I prefer Mattel here. Valuations are similar, and yet I think Mattel is a little bit on a stronger footing right now than Hasbro.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, thank you for your insights. Linda Bolton-Weiser there from D.A. Davidson, thank you for joining me this morning.]"

(NYSE:FIS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 24th of March to $0.52. This takes the dividend yield to 3.0%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Fidelity National Information Services' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Fidelity National Information Services is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 0.7%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendFidelity National Information Services Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.08. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Fidelity National Information Services' EPS has declined at around 75% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Fidelity National Information Services' DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Fidelity National Information Services' payments are rock solid. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We don't think Fidelity National Information Services is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

(NYSE:GDDY) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 14, 2023Christie Masoner: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions.

With that, here's Aman.Story continuesAman Bhutani: Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy's mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. We achieve this by providing sage guidance and robust tools so our customers can have a one-stop shop with GoDaddy. GoDaddy is delivering tools that help our customers get online and start their digital journey, tools that merge the in-store and online experience for their customers and bring commerce to every surface. This empowers them to focus on running their business. Today, Mark and I will cover our 2022 financial results and key accomplishments in the context of our 3-year plan laid out at Investor Day last February. We will also share more information on our progress, especially in Commerce and the continued opportunity there and managing our P&amp;L in the face of an uncertain macro environment.In 2022, GoDaddy delivered $4.1 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a constant currency basis and over $1 billion in Normalized EBITDA driving a 25% margin. Free cash flow increased 13% leading to a 22% increase in free cash flow per share of $6.20 higher than our 2022 targets. Our strategy, direction and priorities continue to be consistent with our 3-year plan as we work to empower new customers and our large base of existing customers with more of our product offerings, including enabling Commerce on every surface. I will go into a bit more detail in the Commerce priority section but just to touch on it now, in about 18 months, GoDaddy has added incredible new products to our lineup, including OmniCommerce offerings with Websites + Marketing and our newly launched SaaS solution, Managed WooCommerce Stores on WordPress, Payable Domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons and much more.Our previously announced commerce offerings are now fully in market. And today, we are adding to that lineup with an exciting new partnership with FIS Worldpay, to be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. The teams are already working together, and we are receiving positive feedback from customers. We remain confident in the long-term growth potential we outlined last year in our 3-year plan, but also recognize that these top-line growth targets may be challenged in the short-term. As a result, we have taken some aggressive and disciplined actions in our cost structure that will result in over $100 million in annualized cost savings, preserving our ability to achieve profitability targets even in a weak economic environment.These actions include deeper integration of some of our acquired brands, an overall reduction in vendor spend and an 8% reduction in our global workforce. We will continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments in our top growth areas and priorities of driving commerce through presence, delivering for Web Pros and innovating in domains. As always, I will share a bit about our key priorities on this call and focus more on Commerce this time. On driving commerce through presence, at Investor Day we shared our vision of connected commerce, which is about bringing commerce to every surface. Our goal has been to launch products and capabilities to engage the commerce customer early in the lifecycle, which might be a Payable Domain or a Pay Button on a Websites + Marketing freemium website.We have made tremendous progress in this direction through the broad release of payments into our website builders, domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons, and more. In Q4, we furthered our reach by enabling GoDaddy Payments, by default, in all new commerce websites. In January, we rolled out our payments by default out to new domain purchases. Most of our new offerings have been in market in the U.S. for less than a year and we are just starting to engage our base, so I am happy to share that our customers transacted $760 million of gross payment volume in 2022. GPV has been accelerating, and we are looking forward to sharing this metric with you regularly. We have also launched our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering on WooCommerce and WordPress, called Managed WooCommerce Stores.This product is targeted at the larger end of our micro-business customers, giving them the flexibility and ability to scale to their needs. Merchants can sell on a highly performant website, sell in-person using GoDaddy terminals, and via marketplace and social channels with shared payments and inventory. We are excited by the opportunity and potential this offering brings to customers who need a more robust solution. We are also leveraging our Managed WooCommerce Stores offering in our new partnership with FIS Worldpay. FIS Worldpay is a market-leading merchant services provider, and we will be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. FIS Worldpay provides payment strategies and technologies to over 1,400 financial institutions, including more than 700 credit unions throughout the U.S., supporting over 33 million debit cards and processing more than 15.7 billion transactions each year.Bringing together FIS Worldpay's reach, and our commerce products will create a significant new offering in the marketplace. And briefly on supporting GoDaddy Pros, we have continued to improve our product offering and have started to integrate more deeply some of our acquired brands. While these projects are complex, they will lead to a much better customer experience and lower costs. For one of our key brands, Media Temple, we informed all customers in December 2022 and will be sunsetting the brand over the next 3 months. And while I already mentioned our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering, we are actively testing price points that best appeal to our Web Pros customers and audience. Our third priority is innovating in domains and we continue to add value into our aftermarket platform.In Q4, our Dan.com integration reached a critical milestone 6 months ahead of schedule by launching Dan listings on our Afternic platform. All Dan users currently opted-in for the distribution network will now benefit from greater exposure as their inventory is automatically integrated into the Afternic domain listing service network. This milestone was accompanied by numerous other enhancements such as bid and offer history that further optimized the aftermarket experience. Payable Domains is 100% enabled in the U.S. and will be ramping up the marketing launch in a couple of weeks. As you recall, Payable Domains are branded pay links that create a secure checkout page, shareable via a link, that enable U.S.-based domain name customers to begin accepting payments shortly after they purchase a newly registered domain, even if they do not yet have a website or online store.For any domain purchased, existing or new, customers can already access the respective Payable Domain through their GoDaddy Dashboard. Combining the ability to accept payments with the credibility of a domain name enables small businesses to get up and running easily and quickly. While this capability has been rolling over a few months, we're thrilled and ready to be fully in-market giving GoDaddy domain customers a truly differentiated domain with expanded payment capabilities. In closing, we are pleased with the quarterly and annual financial results we delivered, while operating in this difficult environment. More importantly, we are proud of our progress against the key initiatives that we outlined last year at our Investor Day. We remain incredibly excited for the future.We are building on our unique market leading position with identified, abundant, long-term opportunity, bringing together our customers' digital identity, their presence and connecting commerce to every surface. Being this one-stop shop for our customers is at the center of our strategy. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, participating in our customers' success, intently focused on delivering strong financial results, and as always growing shareholder value. With that, here's Mark.15 biggest Canadian software companiesCopyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock PhotoMark McCaffrey: Thanks Aman. Hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Last year, we hosted a comprehensive Investor Day, where we shared our financial goals for the coming 3 years around revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, free cash flow per share and share buybacks. GoDaddy turned in a strong year against those financial goals, delivering revenue of $4.1 billion; Normalized EBITDA of $1 billion; free cash flow per share of $6.20 and executing $1.3 billion in share buybacks, meeting and exceeding our targets. While revenue growth has moderated in the short-term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day and feel the strategic steps Aman described earlier will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of growth going forward.We also remain committed to completing our share buybacks authorized by the Board last year. Reviewing our annual financial results, total revenue was $4.1 billion in 2022, growing 7%. Excluding a point and a half of FX headwind, total revenue for the year would have grown over 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue for the year grew to $1.3 billion, representing 13% growth, and Core platform revenue for the year totaled $2.8 billion, representing 5% growth, both in line with the targets we set last year. International revenue was $1.3 billion for the year, representing 5% growth. Excluding the FX impact, international growth would have been 8% on a constant currency basis. Total bookings in 2022 was $4.4 billion, growing 4%, or 6% on a constant currency basis.Full year unlevered free cash flow grew to $1.1 billion, representing 14% growth, in line with our guide issued last year. Free cash flow grew 13% to $969 million. Free cash flow per share increased 22% to $6.20 per share, ahead of our investor day target of $6. Lastly, full year Normalized EBITDA grew 16% topping $1 billion, resulting in a 25% margin for the year, which is an expansion of 2 points over the prior year. Moving on to our fourth quarter results, total revenue topped $1 billion, growing 2%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue grew 3%, or 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue grew 11% to $333 million, in line with the guided range of 10% to 12% for the quarter. Growth in Applications and Commerce was fueled by continued adoption of our Create and Grow products, email attach, and increasingly the adoption of GoDaddy payments and the related hardware sales.The ARR for applications and commerce grew 9% to $1.3 billion. With that, the ARR from our create and grow products grew 8% to $445 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $28 billion. Furthering our efforts to provide more visibility into key growth areas of the business, we will share a new metric demonstrating our progress with GoDaddy Payments. GPV represents the dollar amount of payments processed on the GoDaddy payments platform. With Q4 as the first quarter with commerce fully launched on every surface in the U.S., GPV has already grown to an impressive $760 million. Core platform revenue decreased 2% to $707 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the tough compare to the year-ago quarter when aftermarket benefited from some larger than average transactions we have discussed previously as well as a modest decrease in our hosting business.As previously mentioned, the hosting business has out-sized exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for core platform grew 1% to $2.3 billion. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, flat year-over-year and growing 2% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 7% on strength of Websites + Marketing, email attach and hardware and software sales. Core Platform bookings decreased 3% year-over-year on tough aftermarket compares noted earlier and due to softness in the broader hosting business. Gross margin was down slightly for the quarter, primarily due to product mix. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as this revenue stream gets larger in the future. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments, so we expect payments to be highly accretive to Normalized EBITDA as we scale.Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 5% to $266 million, representing a 26% margin and an expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. GoDaddy's high brand awareness and the effectiveness of our in-house bidding algorithm allowed us to drive efficiencies in marketing spend. We also continued to drive leverage in customer care. Unlevered free cash flow grew 17% to $238 million, while free cash flow grew 16% to $202 million delivering $1.29 free cash flow per share in the quarter, a 25% increase over last year's Q4 free cash flow per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the year with $774 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion.Net debt landed at $3.1 billion, below 3 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. On our share repurchase efforts, we've returned $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders under the current authorization. From January 1, 2022 through February 1, 2023, we repurchased 17.2 million shares, which has reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 10% since the beginning of 2022, on target for the 15% to 20% net reduction for the 3-year period. On customers, over recent years, the way we generate revenue has evolved through our expanded offerings to our customers, resellers and partners. We will continue to use metrics like ARR, GMV and GPV to show the health of our business and the progress towards our strategic goals as discussed at Investor Day.As a result of the way our relationship with customers is evolving, we have updated the way we measure and report our total customers. In addition to paid subscriptions at the end of the period, we will now include accounts with paid transactions in the trailing 12 months and exclude accounts that have converted to free versions of our software. These changes do not meaningfully affect the historical customer growth or retention trends previously disclosed. We believe the updated definition more accurately reflects the dynamic customer lifecycle and provides more detail around the overall strength of our historical cohorts with a continued focus on long-term customers with a higher propensity to spend. Under the new definition, in 2022 ARPU increased to $197 compared to $187 and $170 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Retention rates remained consistent at 85% and customer count increased to 20.9 million in 2022 compared to 20.7 and 20.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Moving on to our outlook for Q1 and for full year 2023, let us start by covering several notable events. In January, we signed a partnership agreement with FIS Worldpay to be a strategic reseller of our OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. This arrangement is expected to drive growth in the second half of the year and will contribute to our commerce strategy through increased reach of our OmniCommerce offerings and website attachment. We are excited about the launch of this partnership in 2023 and the momentum this gives our Application and Commerce segment going into 2024 and beyond.On restructuring, we took certain actions necessary to align our structure with the current economic environment and position ourselves for future growth. This will result in annualized savings of approximately $100 million through a combination of a reduction in workforce, reduced spending, and integration of certain European brands and businesses within our Core Platform segment. This will also result in a modest headwind to core platform revenue of 100 basis points in 2023 as we sunset certain brands. We expect estimated restructuring and other related exit charges of $55 million to $65 million with most of the charges to be recognized in the first half of 2023. In Q1 2023, we are targeting total revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion.This represents 4% growth at the midpoint of the range and includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind from prior year bookings. Excluding this, the midpoint of our guidance would imply approximately 6 points of growth. We expect Normalized EBITDA margin during Q1 to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.25 billion to $4.325 billion, representing growth of 5% at the midpoint of the range. This outlook is inclusive of approximately 2 points of headwind from FX from prior year bookings and the anticipated brand integrations mentioned above. In the Application and Commerce segment, we are projecting revenue growth of 8% to 10%. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%.Normalized EBITDA during the year is expected to continue to grow, with a targeted margin of approximately 26%. As a reminder, as we scale our commerce offerings, gross margin will be pressured and is expected to be in the low- to mid-60s range. As we gain operational efficiency in commerce, this is expected to drive incremental Normalized EBITDA margins. As we have shared previously, we have multiple levers within our control to drive margins, while we continue to invest in the business. This allows us to strike a balance and continue growing revenue, while achieving operating leverage down the income statement to drive sustainable shareholder value over the cycle. You have seen our recent record of accomplishment of delivering against our margin targets, and we are confident in executing on our profitability goals this year regardless of where we land within our revenue guidance range.For the full year of 2023, we are targeting free cash flow of greater than $1 billion and unlevered free cash flow of greater than $1.2 billion. We remain on target to deliver free cash flow per share of more than $7 and are committed to returning capital to the shareholders under the remaining buyback authorized by the Board in 2022. As stated in the past, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and we will continue to evaluate our use-of-cash options on a quarterly basis. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $50 million, income tax payments of approximately $30 million and cash interest payments of approximately $170 million. Moving forward, we will share ARR, GMV, ARPU and customer count quarterly. We will share GPV and retention rate annually.Taken together, these metrics provide a more comprehensive view of GoDaddy's expansive business over time and provide a view into revenue growth and profitability as we continue to expand customer lifetime value. These metrics may fluctuate based on acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and seasonality. That said, we are in an advantaged position given our ability to provide an ever-growing suite of solutions to a large, embedded customer base. In summary, we are proud of our strong and resilient business model, where we are mission critical to our customers. We are confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day, and feel the strategic steps taken this quarter will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of revenue growth going forward into 2024 and beyond.Our predictable model provides us the visibility to make prudent business decisions and allows us to remain resolute in operating the business to grow long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll hand over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&amp;A.A - Christie Masoner: Thanks, Mark. Sorry about the technical difficulties in the middle of the call, our prepared remarks are posted to investors.godaddy.net for reference.

(NASDAQ:TRIP) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 15, 2023Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Tripadvisor Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Angela White, VP of Investor Relations. Ms. White, please go ahead.Angela White: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Tripadvisor's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results call. Joining me today are Matt Gvoldberg, President and CEO; and Mike Noonan, CFO. Last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our earnings release and made available our shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. In the release, you'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also on our Investor Relations website, you'll find supplemental financial information, which also includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other metrics. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's view as of today, February 15, 2023.Tripadvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.Matt Goldberg: Thank you, Angela, and good morning to everyone joining the call. We're pleased with our q4 and full year performance, a combination of the travel industry recovery as a whole, our position in the travel ecosystem, and solid execution by our teams. As we said in the Shareholder Letter we published last night, we saw a strong recovery with 65% consolidated revenue growth relative to 2021, reaching nearly 96% of 2019 revenue for the full year and exiting the year at 106% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. We also expanded margins year-over-year in 2022, balancing investment in future profitable growth with prudent cost management across the portfolio. This performance is strong overall relative to our expectations, but we still face mixed recovery and margin pressure in parts of our portfolio.Story continuesIn particular in our Tripadvisor Core segment, which we intend to address head on. I will come back to that shortly. But first let's start with Viator, where the team continued to drive accelerated growth in 2020 to delivering record revenue and scale, with gross bookings value of approximately $2.7 billion, or 186% of 2019 levels. We compete in a large, highly fragmented and under penetrated experiences market, which is estimated to grow to more than $275 billion by 2025. We consider this market highly attractive given that approximately 70% is still offline, but has consistently moved more online each year, with tailwinds from the secular shift in consumer spending preferences away from physical goods in favor of experiences. We're well positioned to take advantage of these secular trends.And our team is doing this through focus, execution and strategic investments which are paying off. We served a record number of both first time and repeat customers in 2022. And we're improving conversion across mobile web and app, which in the year accounted for more than 50% of bookings volume. Viator's tour operator partners are receiving more value than ever before, thanks to our growing demand footprint and new product features that allow them to drive extra visibility on our platform. We were also pleased with the balance between aggressively growing our market share while making year-over-year improvements in profitability, which highlights the potential to achieve further operating leverage in the business. Next, at TheFork, revenue reached 126 million in 2022, growing 48% year-over-year, and reaching 99% of 2019 levels.On a constant currency basis. This result exceeded 2019 levels after considering estimated currency headwinds of approximately 6 points. For reference, the overall European restaurants market is still approximately 14% below 2019. The strength of our two-sided marketplace is evidenced on both the diner side and the restaurant side, while the number of bookable restaurants have not yet fully recovered to 2019 levels, total bookings on our platform reached 106% of 2019 levels with sustained performance in diner monetization. TheFork continues to represent a meaningful source of demand for its restaurant partners, connecting them to millions of diners through our app in driving repeat visits over time. Direct bookings from repeat customers on TheFork's platform drove more than 75% of total bookings in 2022.A result reflects the team's increased focus on key markets, particularly those in Europe, where we've established scale and have confidence we can win. Finally, in our Tripadvisor Core segment, we saw a positive trajectory, with revenue of $966 million growing 45% year-over-year, and reaching 79% of 2019 levels. Prudent cost management contributed to year-over-year expansion of adjusted EBITDA down margin to 36% in 2022, from 27% in the prior year. And while we're pleased with the recovery of our experiences, and our hotel meta offerings in the U.S., both of which have fully recovered to 2019 levels as travelers returned. We're not satisfied with the pace of our overall recovery for the segment, including the slower recovery in our media and B2B offerings.Although some of this mirrors the cyclical impact of marketing and advertising budgets, it also reflects ongoing factors that you all understand clearly, upstream competition, heightened traveler expectations, shifting advertising budgets, and our own focus and execution challenges to keep pace with the evolving market. The last point highlights the need to chart a durable path forward for growth and profitability in Tripadvisor Core, and provides a good transition to our long-term value creation strategies and specific priorities for 2023. Tripadvisor group represents a family of brands with a unique position in our industry that addresses attractive markets across travel and experiences, digital advertising and emerging marketplaces across multiple categories.We attract a large global audience who trust our platforms for information, guidance and recommendations when they're making important decisions throughout their travel journey. We have access to a wealth of high intent data to drive value for travelers and our partners. Whether looking for inspiration, planning a trip, considering the next experience or making it happen. Across the group, we're united by a common vision to be the world's most trusted source for traveling experiences, with each segment uniquely serving this vision and reinforcing each other. But we pursue different value creation strategies for each segment, managing priorities and levels of investment appropriately given the stages of growth market opportunities and our competitive positioning.At Viator, we will invest in growth in 2023 to accelerate our leadership position. This means driving awareness and market share and investing and enhancing our app experience and features for our partners, which we believe will result in greater direct repeat behavior. We expect this to strengthen lifetime value economics, which will extend our market leadership and contribute to longer term sustainable profitability. At TheFork, we plan to leverage our investments of the past few years to deliver strong growth in 2023, while targeting significant improvements in margins. This means continuing to grow both our restaurant and diner base in our priority markets by offering innovative tools and features on our platform, and through continued awareness of our brand.This brings us to an area where I've spent much of my time since joining Tripadvisor group, aligning the Tripadvisor core segment around a clear, long term strategy and specific priorities for 2023. The Tripadvisor Core segment plays an important role in our portfolio. Over the past 20 plus years, we built some powerful assets, a trusted brand authentic content, a large community of contributors, and one of the largest global travel audiences available anywhere. And we've created a portfolio of offerings that provide value for both travelers and partners. However, it is apparent that as traveler needs and our competitive landscape continue to evolve, our business faces known headwinds. Our leadership team has been working intensively to conduct a robust and objective review of our performance and trajectory and develop a plan to respond.We have immersed ourselves in a rich, data driven fact base, to deeply understand today's travelers and how we can best meet their needs. We set out specifically to put the traveler first, address both opportunities and challenges and drive steady, profitable growth. Delivering this outcome is not contingent on a speculative bet, a silver bullet or a risky agenda. Instead, we have high conviction in a strategy grounded in deeper traveler engagement, enabled by better products, and stronger execution. This builds on our heritage and the reasons travelers come to us in the first place. Let me articulate the articulate the crux of our strategy. First, we will innovate around world-class guidance products to help travelers make decisions in a world where it's hard to find advice you can trust.It all starts with differentiated content that gives travelers a compelling reason to come to us directly. We have an enduring foundation with our reviews, forums and other community contributions. We will focus on new immersive formats with fresh authentic perspectives, like itineraries, guides and collections that we can create and curate with technology and data at a global scale. We will deliver this content through essential trip planning tools that are more useful to travelers than anything else offered today. This includes both pre-trip planning when travelers are building the perfect itinerary as well as in destination when travelers are making immediate decisions about what to do next. As we evolve our product experience, we will take a mobile-first approach.Today, the mobile experience is relatively undifferentiated versus the desktop site. We can enhance our mobile web experience and give travelers more reasons to download and return to our app. Second, we will prioritize deeper engagement with travelers, meeting their decision making needs in a more personalized way. Today, our model is optimized around attracting high volumes of traffic bouncing on and off our platform to verify their travel choices as part of the travel planning process. We will continue to fine tune that but we also have a significant opportunity to do a better job addressing the needs of the majority of our audience, giving them better reasons to engage more deeply and creating even more value for all our partners. This must begin with data and taking full advantage of everything we know about travelers to serve them in a more relevant, curated and contextual way.Photo by Caleb George on UnsplashAs we develop a more persistent relationship with travelers, we'll be able to offer a clearer path to become a member of our community and earn their loyalty. We see a unique opportunity to recognize and reward travelers for their engagement. And while we will continue to experiment with our paid membership tier, Tripadvisor Plus, we think strengthening the value proposition of a free membership program is the right place to start. Third, we will drive a step change in the value we can deliver to our partners. This engagement model will enable us to accelerate and diversify the monetization of our valuable audience, whether through hotel meta, media advertising solutions or emerging marketplaces across valuable travel categories starting with experiences.To be clear, we will continue to reinforce our position in hotel meta, having a more engaged audience with better data and clearer signals of intent helps us deliver more high quality traffic to our OTA and hotel partners. We will also focus on two other immediate monetization pads where this strategy can fuel meaningful growth. The first is experiences. We're just beginning to scratch the surface of introducing bookable experiences to our vast audience. And we're going to continue to work to accelerate this opportunity. As we continue to scale the experiences category, we can extend our learnings to other categories where matching supply and demand is valuable for both travelers and our partners. The second is media. We have an opportunity to expand our value proposition with brands, both in travel related and non-endemic categories to engage our audiences in a contextually relevant manner that is additive to the consumer experience.We can increase the value of our audiences by delivering new ad products and leveraging our data more effectively to improve audience targeting for purchase intent, relevance and attribution. Taken together, these strategic priorities are integrated and reinforcing powered by first party data and signals of intent. With each interaction, we can serve travelers better. An increasingly personalized experience delivers more relevance, greater engagement and more opportunities for monetization. Now, we won't do it all at once. We're going to focus in 2023 on areas where we have the most conviction and iterate our way towards this North Star. A balanced approach to sequencing reflects our commitment to an attractive financial profile. Our plan will enable us to drive margin expansion over the next several years and grow revenue for the long-term.We believe this approach is the optimal value creation strategy for Tripadvisor Core and it also fuels our ability to continue to invest in experiences and Viator in particular, while preserving the flexibility to pursue inorganic opportunities in our broader portfolio. We know delivering on this plan requires focused execution. Value will be delivered by making it happen in practice. And we recognize that our past execution has not always delivered on our aspirations. So we're changing how we're organized and the way we operate in order to execute more effectively. We've introduced an updated operating model that balances the autonomy and empowerment of P&amp;L ownership with strong functional alignment and collaboration. We've added critical new leadership roles and aligned our teams around product, marketing, technology and data, sales and operations.This breaks down silos, and already, we're seeing improved efficiency and productivity and increased capacity in areas like engineering to reallocate resources to our top strategic priorities. We are also executing on a road map to enhance our core data and technology capabilities to provide the foundation for our engagement led product experience. And we've already gotten started putting in place a new customer data platform, which will provide a single view of our customers and the ability to leverage data across all of Tripadvisor Group. When I think about this strategy, the distillation of our path forward, I can't underscore enough the opportunity we see ahead. We believe that we are best positioned of anyone in our ecosystem to help travelers make decisions in a world where it's hard to find advice you can trust.We're excited about our strategy for Tripadvisor Core and the future of Tripadvisor Group. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.Mike Noonan: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review the results of the fourth quarter, briefly cover our performance for the full year and provide some color on the trends for the first quarter and thoughts on 2023. In summary, we had a strong fourth quarter and full year. We exceeded expectations in Q4 with consolidated revenue of $354 million reflecting year-over-year growth of 47% and reaching 106% of 2019 levels. Recovery rates versus 2019 for reportable segments, Tripadvisor Core, Viator and TheFork were 85%, 208% and 94%, respectively. Let me dive into some top line highlights from Q4 for each of the segments. At Tripadvisor Core, we saw better-than-expected performance in the quarter as revenue reached 85% of 2019 levels, which is a modest step back from third quarter's result of 88%.Our overall branded hotel revenue was 90% of 2019 levels compared to 95% in Q3. Hotel meta revenue recovered to 93% as we saw consistent performance through the quarter. We continue to see varying degrees of recovery by geography with U.S. remaining well over '19 levels, while EMEA and Rest of the World remain below '19 levels. Our hotel B2B revenue line had a solid quarter improving sequentially. Similarly, revenue from our media and platform offering also saw acceleration in the quarter, reaching 85% of 2019 levels, which is acceleration from third quarter's recovery rate of 80%. Tripadvisor's Core's experience and dining revenue saw strong growth in the quarter, reaching 113% recovery versus 2019. This represents a modest step down from Q3's results of 125%.Within this revenue line, the experiences recovery rates continue to accelerate sequentially and was well above the overall experiences and dining recovery rate. As an important reminder, other revenue within Tripadvisor Core includes offerings within the crews, flights, vacation rentals and rental cars categories. When considering these offerings in categories with those we have since divested such as SmarterTravel in China, this revenue stream collectively represented over $160 million in annual revenue in 2019. As we sharpen our focus and look to prioritize investments in our highest return opportunities, there are areas that we will continue to invest in as well as other areas where we'd be more prudent in terms of capital allocation. And as such, we do not expect Tripadvisor Core's other revenue line as currently defined to fully recover to 2019 level.At Viator, we continue to see strong demand in Q4. Revenue recovery versus 2019 reached 208%, which is an increase from third quarter's rate of 179%. We saw strengthening demand towards the back half of the quarter despite major weather disruptions and a subsequent increase in cancellations. Gross bookings grew to over $600 million, which represented 220% versus '19 levels. At TheFork, recovery versus 2019 was 94% for the quarter, which was negatively impacted by estimated currency headwinds of about 9 points. The sequential stepdown is primarily impacted by the timing of an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2019. Without this, the recovery rate would have been closer to fully recover, a modest step down from last quarter's rate of 103%.The sequential decline is due in part to a larger-than-expected impact of the World Cup in TheFork's major European markets in October and November as well as European macro conditions, which have impacted both diner demand as well as restaurant supply. Turning now to the full year 2022, we reached nearly $1.5 billion in revenue and consolidated revenue, which is 96% of 2019 levels and represent 65% year-over-year growth rate. Growth in recovery was driven in large part by our Viator segment at 171% of 2019 levels and 168% year-over-year growth, and to a lesser extent, our Tripadvisor Core Hotel meta and experiences revenue and TheFork. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $43 million on a consolidated basis or 12% of revenue. This is flat with adjusted EBITDA margin of 12% in Q4 2021 and down versus 27% in Q4 of 2019.On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down about 15 points as compared to Q4 '19. This is primarily the result of greater investment in our experience offering, both in Viator and Tripadvisor Core through performance marketing spend and experiences becoming a larger part of the overall mix of our business. It's also due, to a lesser extent, to a higher mix of paid traffic in hotel meta within Tripadvisor Core. This has been partially offset by leverage on our fixed and discretionary costs on a consolidated basis. In our Tripadvisor Core segment, the primary drivers of the lower adjusted EBITDA margin versus Q4 2019, or increases in performance marketing to drive experiences as well as hotel meta traffic mix shift. We also witnessed some deleverage in fixed and discretionary costs due to lower revenue recovery despite these costs being lower on an absolute basis.In Viator, the improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin relative to 2019 in Q4 are due to the significant leverage in our headcount and other fixed costs as a percent of revenue, offsetting increases in performance marketing and recent brand spend. Finally, in TheFork, adjusted EBITDA margin performance relative to Q4 '19 was driven primarily by increases in traffic and other variable costs in headcount and other direct costs. These investments have been in support of driving awareness to consumers and our restaurant partners, which we hope to leverage in 2023. Taking a moment to look at adjusted EBITDA margin sequentially, we saw a reduction of about 13 percentage points from Q3 to Q4 '22 compared to a sequential step down in 2019 of 3 percentage points.As we discussed on our last earnings call, Q4 '19 benefited from a large step down in television advertising spend at Tripadvisor Core and a reduction in our bonus accrual totaling about 6 percentage points of this difference. Without these factors, the adjusted EBITDA margin in Q4 2019 would have been approximately 6 points lower than the 27% margin reported that quarter. The remaining difference can be attributed to the Q3 to Q4 2022, smaller sequential step down in variable marketing costs in Viator and Tripadvisor Core experiences as well as a sequentially larger increase in fixed discretionary costs as a percent of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 was $295 million or 20% of revenue, reflecting a significant improvement from 11% of revenue in 2021, but down from 28% of revenue in 2019.Our deleverage versus 2019 is largely due to a higher mix of performance marketing expenses and our faster growing experiences business, as we incur the spend in advance of revenue recognition. At Viator, we believe that this investment is supported by growth in new customer bookings and the improvements we've seen in our return customer behavior. Repeat customers who in recent cohorts return more frequently also spend more with us improving our unit economics. Additionally, in Tripadvisor Core, we've invested more in experiences, given the attractiveness of this category. In hotel meta, as you've seen, longer-term shift in search marketing that have impacted our channel mix, we increased performance marketing slightly to drive revenue while maintaining our ROA targets.To partly offset the increase in variable marketing as a percent of revenue, we've maintained our lower fixed and discretionary costs as a percent of revenue. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Free cash flow for this year was $344 million, which was up meaningfully versus $54 million in free cash flow in 2021. This year-over-year improvement was due to higher operating cash flow, which includes the benefit of positive working capital movements at Viator related to deferred merchant payables as well as some onetime tax credits we received related to the pandemic. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet with just over $1 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in total liquidity, including our undrawn credit facility. We believe that our strong liquidity and cash flow profile provides us a solid cushion against any potential macro headwinds as well as allows us to pursue capital allocation decisions that will drive long-term value creation.Additionally, as noted in our shareholder letter, in the first quarter of 2023 as part of the disclosed IRS audit of Expedia for the years 2019 through 2011, we expect to incur an additional income tax charge in an estimated range of $25 million to $35 million during the first quarter of 2023. From a cash flow perspective, a net cash outflow of approximately $70 million to $80 million is expected during 2023. This will have no impact on our adjusted EBITDA. Now on to the recent trends and thoughts for the first quarter. We want to provide a little more color and remind folks of the dynamics of January relative to the first quarter and the first quarter relative to the full year outlook for which we provided last night. While we will not continue to the comparison to 2019 when we move into fiscal '23, I will provide some color on January's performance relative to 2019 as a reference point.In Tripadvisor Core, January 2023 recovery versus '19 was in the mid-70s percent, a step down from 85% in Q4 2022. We expect the recovery rate versus 2019 will be lower for the quarter due to the tougher compare in the first half of 2019. Revenue versus 2019 for Viator in the fourth in January saw a strong improvement from Q4's recovery levels, and we expect that to continue in Q1. Switching now to year-over-year growth in January, we saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth rates across all segments versus where we exited Q4 2022. As a reminder, January of 2022 was a weaker period for us given the Omicron variant while February and March of '22, recovery accelerated at a very fast pace. Given this dynamic, we expect that February and March growth rates will normalize.The result will be a small sequential step-down of our consolidated growth rate in Q1 2023. With regard to consolidated EBITDA margin, in Q1, we expect margins to be largely consistent with the same period a year ago. This assumes a flat margin year-over-year in Tripadvisor Core. As a reminder, the Q1 margin trend reflects the seasonality of marketing spend at Viator. In the shareholder letter last night, we noted that for the full year, we expect full year consolidated revenue growth that reflects the diverse growth profiles across our portfolio and is consistent with the broader travel growth trends. And consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin to remain flat year-over-year, which assumes approximately flat year-over-year margins in Tripadvisor Core as well.I will reiterate how excited we are about our direction. We believe our plan sets us up to drive sustainable, profitable growth and deliver on our near and longer-term strategic priorities. At Tripadvisor Core, we'll be focusing on operational execution to produce stable margins this year while we establish a foundation to deliver long-term sustainable revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Viator will continue to invest in growth and market share gains, while driving improving economics that reflect the profit potential in this business. Finally, at TheFork, we'll be aiming for significant margin improvement, in particular in the second half of the year while continuing to drive healthy growth. To this end, we're managing our business to longer-term priorities.Our goal is to build a business that can deliver attractive durable revenue growth rates that will drive adjusted EBITDA growth as well as expanding margins over time. In the near term, we look forward to keeping you updated. With that, I'll pass the call back over to the operator for Q&amp;A.See also 25 Best Countries for Solo Female Travelers and 10 Largest Prisons in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

312,ca804feb-efba-3372-b7b5-d04d99f182de,RHI,2023-02-17,7 Stocks That Wall Street Hates — and YOU Should Buy!,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-wall-street-hates-223227761.html,1676327547,STORY,"['INTC', 'CLX', 'HRB', 'TROW', 'K', 'RHI', 'ED']","[While it’s usually not the wisest move to trade against Wall Street experts, sometimes, they overlook certain ideas, presenting contrarian opportunities among stocks to buy. To be sure, the politics of the investment analysis world dictates that experts lean more bullishly; otherwise, it’s difficult to establish relationships with corporate movers and shakers. And this also implies that when analysts go bearish, they really mean it.Still, the experts don’t always get it right. For instance, many esteemed personalities on the Street criticized cryptocurrencies as nothing more than a fad several years ago. Today, the biggest business news agencies include major crypto prices in their ticker tape. That’s one example of ignoring assets or stocks to buy based on expert opinion that eventually imposed an opportunity cost.Nevertheless, investors should do their research to decide what’s best for them. In the meantime, here are some ideas for stocks to buy to kickstart that research process.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKKellogg$68.38INTCIntel$28.55HRBH&amp;R Block$39.75EDConsolidated Edison$92.80CLXClorox$152.89RHIRobert Half$84.40TROWT. Rowe Price$121.36Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comStarting off this list of stocks to buy that Wall Street hates, we have breakfast king Kellogg (NYSE:K). According to a consensus of covering analysts, they peg K as a moderate sell. Unusually, no expert currently believes Kellogg’s worth of a buy rating. Instead, we have six holds and three sells. In fairness, their average price target pings at $70, which implies over 3% upside.Nevertheless, I disagree with the bearish assessment, primarily because of the company’s plant-based meat initiative. To make a long story short, fake meat encountered trouble because of a lack of economies of scale. However, Kellogg’s Incogmeato brand taps the support of one of the world’s most famous companies. It can succeed where others failed in this otherwise compelling sector.Story continuesFor full disclosure, Kellogg’s financials don’t offer a remarkable profile. Still, it enjoys a solid three-year book growth rate of 12.9%. As well, the bottom line is stacked. Most notably, the company’s return on equity stands at 38.5%, outpacing nearly 95% of its peers. Therefore, K represents one of the stocks to buy.Intel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockWith Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), I can appreciate how the bears came to their negative conclusion. In recent years, the company slipped on competitive pressures and unforced errors. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg INTC as a consensus hold. However, Intel’s barely holding onto this hold assessment, with only three buys mitigating 17 holds and eight sells.Plus, the average price target sits at $27.44, implying 1.29% downside potential. That’s not exactly riveting stuff. Nevertheless, INTC could be an interesting name among stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Intel’s getting its act together. At this year’s CES, the company announced the world’s fastest mobile processor. This should have significant implications for Intel’s bottom line. Both the general laptop market and the gaming-centric laptop subsegment enjoy solid growth projections.On the financials, Gurufocus.com warns that INTC represents a possible value trap. However, the company appears in my view to be settling itself after earlier disappointments. Therefore, INTC could very well be one of the stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAnother entry among stocks to buy that Wall Street doesn’t like, I can also understand pessimism for H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB). For starters, HRB already enjoyed a blistering performance. In the trailing year, shares gained over 58% of equity value. Since the January opener, HRB moved up 11%. Second, with rising layoffs, H&amp;R Block seemingly suffers from a declining total addressable market.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg HRB as a consensus hold. Also, their average price target stands at $38, implying 2.31% downside risk. Nevertheless, I believe it’s one of the stocks to buy.Fundamentally, the tax preparer benefits from the burgeoning gig economy. Specifically, tax requirements for gig workers (independent contractors) feature more complexities than your typical simple return for employees. Plus, you’d figure that some of the laid off will seek opportunities in the gig economy, boosting HRB’s addressable market. Also, note that the market prices HRB at a forward multiple of 9.14. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 86.67% of its peers.Consolidated Edison (ED)Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.Source: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.comThough utility firms tend to be permanently relevant because they represent natural monopolies, Wall Street has different ideas about Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). Presently, covering experts peg ED as a consensus moderate sell. Conspicuously, not one analyst among nine felt that Consolidated was worthy of a buy rating. Instead, we have five holds and four sells.Digging the knife deeper, the average price target sits at $89.89, implying downside risk of 2.67%. While not the most encouraging development, investors shouldn’t give up on it. It’s one of the stocks to buy despite the high-level pessimism.Again, Consolidated Edison enjoys a natural monopoly and there’s not much anyone can do about it. Plus, the company benefits from a massive footprint, representing one of the largest investor-owned energy firms. Its subsidiary provides gas and electric service to New York City, which will remain relevant probably for centuries.Finally, the company provides a decent forward dividend yield of 3.51%. As well, it posts 50 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it one of the stocks to buy, not sell.Clorox (CLX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comNot only does Clorox (NYSE:CLX) generate no love from Wall Street, it’s one of the most hated public enterprises right now. Some of that might stem from coronavirus-related hangovers. Back during the worst of the pandemic, Clorox products symbolized gold bricks. Now, people just don’t give a [waste product].Perhaps unsurprisingly, analysts took a dim view on CLX, pegging it a consensus moderate sell. It does have one buy rating. However, it also has four holds and five sells. Moreover, their average price target sits at $139.40, implying 7.38% downside risk. Despite the cloudy weather, CLX ranks among the stocks to buy.Basically, the contrarian bullish narrative comes down to necessity. Pandemic or not, people need to take care of their homes and themselves. Thus, it’s difficult to imagine being so negative on CLX, particularly with Clorox carrying a forward yield of 3.14%. If anything, according to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Clorox rates as modestly undervalued.Robert Half (RHI)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFor staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI), Wall Street may be responding to the changing dynamics of the workforce. As you’ve probably noticed yourself with store hours suddenly being limited post-pandemic, people don’t want to work just any job. And this attitude extended into the white-collar ecosystem, presenting challenges for Robert Half.Currently, analysts peg RHI as a consensus hold. Among five individual ratings, only one expert viewed RHI as a buy. The others broke down as two holds and two sells. Further, their average price target sits at $75.40, implying nearly 11% downside risk. While it’s not a pretty picture, RHI should be a solid candidate for stocks to buy.Essentially, workers will be forced to drop their attitude of entitlement. While stimulus programs and unemployment checks did much to keep people afloat, that money won’t last forever. As well, with layoffs increasing, demand for RHI should cynically rise. Finally, Robert Half enjoys excellent profitability metrics and features no debt. Combined with its burgeoning relevance, RHI ranks among the stocks to buy, not to sell.T. Rowe Price (TROW)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comIn all fairness, I can appreciate why T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) attracted skepticism from market experts. With the Federal Reserve committed to tackling skyrocketing inflation, its hawkish monetary policy forced deflationary pressures into the system. And really, that goes against the fundamental framework of modern investing. What I mean is, a gentle inflation rate is already baked into the investing paradigm.With deflation becoming a concern if the Fed gets too aggressive, TROW attracted negative sentiment. Currently, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate sell. Also, their average price target sits at $93.10, implying downside risk of nearly 21%. That’s quite staggering if I’m being honest. Still, TROW could be one of the stocks to buy.Fundamentally, despite the market challenges, betting on the stock market arguably offers the best chance for wealth generation. Unfortunately, those higher rates make real estate as an investment (or even as a purchase) unattainable for many. Plus, T. Rowe enjoys a very strong balance sheet with zero debt on its books.

314,7e932f18-6675-3e8f-af30-1c5c62736426,NWL,2023-02-17,Billionaire Ken Griffin Bets Big on These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-griffin-bets-big-161039826.html,1676563839,STORY,"['NYCB', 'NWL']","[While last year wasn’t a particularly good year for stock investors, at least one man closed it out with a smile. Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, didn’t just outperform the markets last year – he managed to outperform them by a margin of $16 billion. It was the highest annual profit ever seen by a Wall Street hedge fund, and reflected the 38% return generated by Citadel’s flagship fund.Now we all know that past performance is no guarantee of future gains – but it’s only human to want to follow a winner, and Griffin’s success in a truly bearish market has, for now, set him head and shoulders above the ordinary.Recent regulatory filings show that Griffin has moved heavily into high-yield dividend stocks, the stock market’s traditional defensive play.Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the details on two of Griffin’s moves, both Buy-rated equities with dividend yields exceeding 6%. We can turn to the Wall Street analysts to find out what else might have brought these stocks to Griffin’s attention. Let's take a closer look.New York Community Bancorp (NYCB)We'll start with New York Community Bancorp, a major name in the banking industry. NYCB recently acquired Flagstar Bank, and is now one of the largest regional banks in the US. The bank offers a full range of services to retail and commercial customers, including mortgage origination and services.The company announced its 4Q22 and full year results on January 31, and saw an immediate positive effect on its stock. The financial release showed a bottom line of 30 cents per diluted share for Q4, exactly the same result as one year earlier – but well above the 20 cents expected. Full-year EPS came in at $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $1.20 in 2021.On the balance sheet, the bank had $90.1 billion in assets, compared to $63 billion at the end of 4Q21. The total included $25.8 billion in assets accrued during the Flagstar acquisition.Story continuesAlso in January, NYCB declared its next dividend payment, for February 16. The payment, of 17 cents per common share, annualizes to 68 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. The company has held its dividend at 17 cents per share since 2016, and has a history of payments going back to 1994.Ken Griffin clearly sees this bancorp as sound investment, as his recent Q4 filings show that he bought in big. In fact, Griffin expanded his existing position in NYCB by over 12.4 million shares – or a whopping 13,215%. His ownership stake in the company is now worth over $119 million.Griffin isn’t the only one bullish on this stock. Covering NYCB for RBC, 5-star analyst Jon Arfstrom takes a bullish stance, writing: “We view core trends as favorable with strong organic loan and deposit growth, better than expected margin expansion, and stable credit quality. Additionally, the company announced a material restructuring of the Flagstar mortgage business that should help drive improvement in the expense base and efficiency over time. Overall, we believe the outlook is reasonable, though dependent on successful execution of the Flagstar integration and restructuring activities.”Looking forward, Arfstrom sets an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on NYCB shares, along with a $12 price target. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~33% potential total return profile. (To watch Arfstrom’s track record, click here)Panning out to a bigger picture, we find that 11 analysts have weighed in on NYCB recently; their reviews include 5 to Buy and 6 to Hold, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See NYCB stock forecast)Newell Brands Inc. (NWL)From banking we’ll switch to consumer staples. Newell Brands may not be a name you know – but it’s almost certain that you’ve used the company’s products. Newell is the manufacturer and distributor of well-known brands such as Paper Mate and Parker pens, X-Acto knives, Sharpie markets, Rubbermaid containers, Baby Jogger strollers, and even Mr. Coffee.While Newell has its hands in a variety of aspects of everyday life, it has been subject to inflationary pressures over the past year. As prices rose, consumers began to cut back on non-essential items – at the same time, companies like Newell also faced pressure in their own purchasing offices as the costs of raw materials went up.The result, in the company’s recently reported 4Q22 results, was a year-over-year decline in sales. Quarterly net sales dropped 18.5% to $2.3 billion; core sales were down by 9.4%. The company also saw the non-GAAP EPS decline from 53 cents in Q3 to just 16 cents for Q4. However, the Q4 EPS did beat expectations by wide margins; analysts had been looking for just 11 cents per share.At the same time, Newell has kept up its highly reliable dividend payment. The company this month declared its next payment for March 15, at 23 cents per common share. Newell has held the dividend at this level since 2017, and the annualized payment of 92 cents is now yielding 6.1% – about triple the average dividend yield found among S&amp;P-listed firms.It’s clear that Ken Griffin saw something worthwhile in Newell Brands; he had an open position on the stock, and loaded up on another 2,285,158 shares in Q4. This expanded his holdings of NWL by more than 300%, and gave him over $45 million interest in the company.Griffin isn’t the only bull here. In her coverage of this consumer staples company, J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira sees it clearing a path forward.""We remain positive in the long run as we think post 1H23 (with sequential progress in 2Q23), the company will start to show the benefits from the restructuring (project OVID and Project Phoenix introduced back in January - see our note), which along with the recent leadership shuffle announced in December is set to allow better execution of this roadmap. Admittedly, the company is seeing greater than originally expected pressure in some more discretionary categories or those more exposed to low-income consumers (e.g., small appliances, home fragrances), but we expect most of the slack to be picked up elsewhere in the 2H23 (e.g., Commercial Solutions, and sell out in Learning &amp; Development),"" Teixeira opined.""While investors may just 'wait-and-see' given uncertainty over the trajectory of the consumer from here, we think current valuation is too cheap to ignore,"" the analyst summed up.In Teixeira’s view, Newell’s opportunities are worth an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and her $18 price target suggests it has room for 18% share appreciation in the year ahead. (To watch Teixeira’s track record, click here)Overall, Newell Brands has 9 recent reviews from the Wall Street analysts, and these reviews are split 4 each to Buy or Hold, with 1 to Sell – all adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

315,ca804feb-efba-3372-b7b5-d04d99f182de,TROW,2023-02-17,7 Stocks That Wall Street Hates — and YOU Should Buy!,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-wall-street-hates-223227761.html,1676327547,STORY,"['INTC', 'CLX', 'HRB', 'TROW', 'K', 'RHI', 'ED']","[While it’s usually not the wisest move to trade against Wall Street experts, sometimes, they overlook certain ideas, presenting contrarian opportunities among stocks to buy. To be sure, the politics of the investment analysis world dictates that experts lean more bullishly; otherwise, it’s difficult to establish relationships with corporate movers and shakers. And this also implies that when analysts go bearish, they really mean it.Still, the experts don’t always get it right. For instance, many esteemed personalities on the Street criticized cryptocurrencies as nothing more than a fad several years ago. Today, the biggest business news agencies include major crypto prices in their ticker tape. That’s one example of ignoring assets or stocks to buy based on expert opinion that eventually imposed an opportunity cost.Nevertheless, investors should do their research to decide what’s best for them. In the meantime, here are some ideas for stocks to buy to kickstart that research process.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKKellogg$68.38INTCIntel$28.55HRBH&amp;R Block$39.75EDConsolidated Edison$92.80CLXClorox$152.89RHIRobert Half$84.40TROWT. Rowe Price$121.36Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comStarting off this list of stocks to buy that Wall Street hates, we have breakfast king Kellogg (NYSE:K). According to a consensus of covering analysts, they peg K as a moderate sell. Unusually, no expert currently believes Kellogg’s worth of a buy rating. Instead, we have six holds and three sells. In fairness, their average price target pings at $70, which implies over 3% upside.Nevertheless, I disagree with the bearish assessment, primarily because of the company’s plant-based meat initiative. To make a long story short, fake meat encountered trouble because of a lack of economies of scale. However, Kellogg’s Incogmeato brand taps the support of one of the world’s most famous companies. It can succeed where others failed in this otherwise compelling sector.Story continuesFor full disclosure, Kellogg’s financials don’t offer a remarkable profile. Still, it enjoys a solid three-year book growth rate of 12.9%. As well, the bottom line is stacked. Most notably, the company’s return on equity stands at 38.5%, outpacing nearly 95% of its peers. Therefore, K represents one of the stocks to buy.Intel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockWith Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), I can appreciate how the bears came to their negative conclusion. In recent years, the company slipped on competitive pressures and unforced errors. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg INTC as a consensus hold. However, Intel’s barely holding onto this hold assessment, with only three buys mitigating 17 holds and eight sells.Plus, the average price target sits at $27.44, implying 1.29% downside potential. That’s not exactly riveting stuff. Nevertheless, INTC could be an interesting name among stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Intel’s getting its act together. At this year’s CES, the company announced the world’s fastest mobile processor. This should have significant implications for Intel’s bottom line. Both the general laptop market and the gaming-centric laptop subsegment enjoy solid growth projections.On the financials, Gurufocus.com warns that INTC represents a possible value trap. However, the company appears in my view to be settling itself after earlier disappointments. Therefore, INTC could very well be one of the stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAnother entry among stocks to buy that Wall Street doesn’t like, I can also understand pessimism for H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB). For starters, HRB already enjoyed a blistering performance. In the trailing year, shares gained over 58% of equity value. Since the January opener, HRB moved up 11%. Second, with rising layoffs, H&amp;R Block seemingly suffers from a declining total addressable market.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg HRB as a consensus hold. Also, their average price target stands at $38, implying 2.31% downside risk. Nevertheless, I believe it’s one of the stocks to buy.Fundamentally, the tax preparer benefits from the burgeoning gig economy. Specifically, tax requirements for gig workers (independent contractors) feature more complexities than your typical simple return for employees. Plus, you’d figure that some of the laid off will seek opportunities in the gig economy, boosting HRB’s addressable market. Also, note that the market prices HRB at a forward multiple of 9.14. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 86.67% of its peers.Consolidated Edison (ED)Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.Source: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.comThough utility firms tend to be permanently relevant because they represent natural monopolies, Wall Street has different ideas about Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). Presently, covering experts peg ED as a consensus moderate sell. Conspicuously, not one analyst among nine felt that Consolidated was worthy of a buy rating. Instead, we have five holds and four sells.Digging the knife deeper, the average price target sits at $89.89, implying downside risk of 2.67%. While not the most encouraging development, investors shouldn’t give up on it. It’s one of the stocks to buy despite the high-level pessimism.Again, Consolidated Edison enjoys a natural monopoly and there’s not much anyone can do about it. Plus, the company benefits from a massive footprint, representing one of the largest investor-owned energy firms. Its subsidiary provides gas and electric service to New York City, which will remain relevant probably for centuries.Finally, the company provides a decent forward dividend yield of 3.51%. As well, it posts 50 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it one of the stocks to buy, not sell.Clorox (CLX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comNot only does Clorox (NYSE:CLX) generate no love from Wall Street, it’s one of the most hated public enterprises right now. Some of that might stem from coronavirus-related hangovers. Back during the worst of the pandemic, Clorox products symbolized gold bricks. Now, people just don’t give a [waste product].Perhaps unsurprisingly, analysts took a dim view on CLX, pegging it a consensus moderate sell. It does have one buy rating. However, it also has four holds and five sells. Moreover, their average price target sits at $139.40, implying 7.38% downside risk. Despite the cloudy weather, CLX ranks among the stocks to buy.Basically, the contrarian bullish narrative comes down to necessity. Pandemic or not, people need to take care of their homes and themselves. Thus, it’s difficult to imagine being so negative on CLX, particularly with Clorox carrying a forward yield of 3.14%. If anything, according to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Clorox rates as modestly undervalued.Robert Half (RHI)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFor staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI), Wall Street may be responding to the changing dynamics of the workforce. As you’ve probably noticed yourself with store hours suddenly being limited post-pandemic, people don’t want to work just any job. And this attitude extended into the white-collar ecosystem, presenting challenges for Robert Half.Currently, analysts peg RHI as a consensus hold. Among five individual ratings, only one expert viewed RHI as a buy. The others broke down as two holds and two sells. Further, their average price target sits at $75.40, implying nearly 11% downside risk. While it’s not a pretty picture, RHI should be a solid candidate for stocks to buy.Essentially, workers will be forced to drop their attitude of entitlement. While stimulus programs and unemployment checks did much to keep people afloat, that money won’t last forever. As well, with layoffs increasing, demand for RHI should cynically rise. Finally, Robert Half enjoys excellent profitability metrics and features no debt. Combined with its burgeoning relevance, RHI ranks among the stocks to buy, not to sell.T. Rowe Price (TROW)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comIn all fairness, I can appreciate why T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) attracted skepticism from market experts. With the Federal Reserve committed to tackling skyrocketing inflation, its hawkish monetary policy forced deflationary pressures into the system. And really, that goes against the fundamental framework of modern investing. What I mean is, a gentle inflation rate is already baked into the investing paradigm.With deflation becoming a concern if the Fed gets too aggressive, TROW attracted negative sentiment. Currently, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate sell. Also, their average price target sits at $93.10, implying downside risk of nearly 21%. That’s quite staggering if I’m being honest. Still, TROW could be one of the stocks to buy.Fundamentally, despite the market challenges, betting on the stock market arguably offers the best chance for wealth generation. Unfortunately, those higher rates make real estate as an investment (or even as a purchase) unattainable for many. Plus, T. Rowe enjoys a very strong balance sheet with zero debt on its books. Therefore, it may be one of the stocks to buy despite the risks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on United Parcel Service's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:58% = US$12b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.58 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.United Parcel Service's Earnings Growth And 58% ROETo begin with, United Parcel Service has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, United Parcel Service's considerable five year net income growth of 21% was to be expected.We then performed a comparison between United Parcel Service's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 20% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if United Parcel Service is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is United Parcel Service Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 58% (implying that it keeps only 42% of profits) for United Parcel Service suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.Besides, United Parcel Service has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 52%. Still, forecasts suggest that United Parcel Service's future ROE will drop to 36% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with United Parcel Service's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

317,ece36635-7962-39ab-9cd4-1bfd1642c56b,UPS,2023-02-17,"Is Trending Stock United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-united-parcel-inc-140002774.html,1676556002,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this package delivery service have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has gained 4.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.33 per share, indicating a change of -23.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -19.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.59 points to a change of -10.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +1% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $98.1 billion and $101.12 billion estimates indicate -2.2% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $27.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. EPS of $3.62 for the same period compares with $3.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.95 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.12%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WY.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Merck, Thermo Fisher and American ExpressThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and American Express Co. (AXP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+39.8% vs. +11.8%). Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher's accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientifichere &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry's decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company's cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company's balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment via share buybacks and dividends.(You can read the full research report on American Expresshere &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today Valero Energy Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

On a year-over-year basis, earnings declined despite revenue improvement.The nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates saw solid growth in aggregates-led business amid a challenging macro-environment. Focus on the operating disciplines and strong pricing actions to overcome inflationary pressures was more than offset by abnormally wet and cold weather that disrupted construction activity and materials shipments, along with soft single-family residential demand.Share of the company plunged almost 7% in the pre-market trading session on Feb 16, after the earnings release.VMC’s chairman and CEO, Tom Hill, said, ""Despite these disruptions, our industry-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased 11 percent in the fourth quarter. We carry solid pricing momentum into 2023 and are focused on our operating disciplines to manage costs and improve efficiencies.  By controlling what we can control, we expect to deliver another year of earnings growth.""Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $1.08 per share missed the consensus mark of $1.29 by 16.3% and declined 13.6% from the year-ago level of $1.25.Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vulcan Materials Company Quote Total revenues of $1,732 million lagged the consensus mark of $1,819 million by 4.8% but increased 7.8% year over year.Segments in DetailAggregatesRevenues from the segment increased 9.3% year over year to $1,259.3 million, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) declined 6.1% year over year. The lingering effects of Hurricane Ian in early October slowed shipments in certain southeastern markets and significant rainfall and extreme winter temperatures impacted November and December construction activity across many markets. The absence of tons available from the company's Mexico operations, which were unexpectedly and arbitrarily shut down by Mexico government in May 2022 added to the negatives.Freight-adjusted average sales price rose 14% to $16.96 per ton (15% on a mix-adjusted basis) from the prior-year level of $14.91. Freight-adjusted revenues rose 6.7% from the prior-year quarter to $918.7 million. Challenging weather conditions, continued energy cost headwinds and inflationary pressures for many parts and supplies in the fourth quarter were partially offset by solid operational execution.Gross profit of $327 million inched up from prior year’s levels despite lower shipments due to unfavorable weather.Story continuesAsphalt, Concrete and CalciumRevenues from the Asphalt segment were $238.1 million, up 20.6% year over year. The segment generated a solid gross profit of $17 million compared with $5 million a year ago on higher pricing. Volumes fell 2% year over year. Asphalt pricing was up 24%, which offset 24% higher pricing for liquid asphalt.Total revenues from the Concrete segment were $360.5 million, down 2.6% year over year. Gross profit totaled $17 million, down from a year ago due to lower volumes and higher costs for diesel fuel. Shipments fell 15% year over year, but average selling prices increased 14% from the prior-year level.Total revenues from the Calcium segment were up to $2.4 million from the prior-year figure of $1.4 million. The segment reported a gross profit of $1.1 million, up from $0.3 million a year ago.Operating HighlightsSelling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses — as a percentage of total revenues — improved 50 basis points to 7.3% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was down 2.1% year over year to $375 million.2022 HighlightsAdjusted earnings came in at $5.11 per share, reflecting an increase from $5.05 a year ago. Total revenues increased to $7,315 million from $5,552 million reported in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA advanced 12.1% year over year to $1,626 million.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $161.4 million, down from $235 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt was $3,875.2 million at 2022-end, compared with $3,874.8 million at 2021-end.For 2022, capital expenditures were $644 million. On 2022-end, total debt to trailing-12-months adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x, down from 2.7x at the end of 2021. Return on average invested capital was 13.5% on a trailing-twelve-months basis.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, the company anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.725-$1.875 billion and net earnings of $715-$835 million. SAG expenses are expected to be $515-$530 million, with interest expenses of approximately $195 million, depreciation, depletion, accretion, and amortization expense of nearly $610 million, and an effective tax rate of 22%.In the Aggregates segment, cash gross profit per ton is likely to improve from the 2022 level of $7.83. Total shipments is likely to be down 2-6%, freight-adjusted price growth is likely to range within 11-13% and freight-adjusted cash cost is estimated to increase high single digit.In Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segment, cash gross profit is expected to be in line with 2022. Asphalt is anticipated to grow on low single-digit growth in volume and price. Also, it is expected to contribute 40-50% of non-aggregates cash gross profit in 2023.Concrete same-store volumes are expected to decline in the mid-single-digit due to slow residential construction activity. Price growth will likely offset the higher raw material cost and will contribute approximately 50-60% of non-aggregates cash gross profit. In 2023, the company expects to have capital expenditures of $600-$650 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesOwens Corning currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 10% from 7% a year ago, driven by a strong performance of the Sustainable Technology Solutions business, acquisitions and solid project execution.Segmental &amp; Backlog DetailsRevenues in the Government Solutions (GS) segment decreased 42.9% year over year to $1,256 million. Although GS continues to benefit from strong appropriations for government spending in all the markets served, the unit experienced some outlays drag, particularly in the United States.

CNP is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 17, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.23%. CenterPoint Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.00%, on average.Factors to NoteThe majority of CNP’s service territories experienced warmer-than-normal temperature patterns for most of the fourth quarter. Such a weather pattern is expected to bolster electricity demand among the company’s customers for cooling purposes. This, along with favorable outcomes from rate cases, must have boosted its top-line performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCenterPoint Energy, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CenterPoint Energy, Inc. QuoteHowever, tornadoes along with thunderstorms and resulting flash floods affected many parts of CenterPoint Energy’s service territories, which may have disrupted this utility’s services in those areas. This is likely to have resulted in outages for its customers, which might have impacted revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNP’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.29 billion, indicating a decline of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The severe weather conditions, mentioned above, might have damaged some of the utility’s properties, thereby increasing its quarterly costs for restoration work. This, in turn, might have hurt earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Elevated interest expenses, along with the extraordinary gas costs incurred by the company during Winter Storm Uri, might continue to hurt its Q4 bottom-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 29 cents per share, indicating a decline of 19.4% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CenterPoint Energy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.

323,f0d0e98f-4a32-39fb-86ff-e7e5f7882503,NI,2023-02-17,PG&E (PCG) Reports Next Week: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-pcg-reports-next-150103088.html,1676559663,STORY,['NIMC'],"[PG&amp;E (PCG) is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $5.7 billion, up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.64% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG&amp;E?For PG&amp;E, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PG&amp;E would post earnings of $0.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of +20.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PG&amp;E doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, NiSource (NI), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended December 2022.

326,add4ded4-7faf-39e2-9f69-1fe0b463508e,FTI,2023-02-17,FMC Technologies (FTI) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fmc-technologies-fti-reports-next-150103000.html,1676559663,STORY,"['FTI', 'PUMP']","[The market expects FMC Technologies (FTI) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of equipment and services to energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +125%.Revenues are expected to be $1.64 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FMC Technologies?For FMC Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -81.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FMC Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FMC Technologies would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.03, delivering a surprise of -66.67%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FMC Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, ProPetro Holding (PUMP) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +270%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $338.19 million, up 37.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ProPetro has been revised 11.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 21.30%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that ProPetro will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""In June 2022, this included introducing a new PPL positioned to create the utilities of the future, generate top-tier earnings and dividend growth, and lead the clean energy transition while delivering exceptional value for our customers and shareowners.""Since then, we have continued to deliver on the goals we set, exceeding the midpoint of our 2022 earnings forecast, advancing industry-leading grid modernization, providing highly reliable electricity and gas service, and economically advancing our clean energy strategy with a proposal that would provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for our Kentucky customers while significantly reducing our carbon footprint,"" said Sorgi.Story continuesIn conjunction with today's earnings announcement, PPL today reaffirmed its 2023 earnings forecast range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share. The midpoint, $1.58 per share, represents a 7% increase over the $1.48 per share midpoint of PPL's 2022 pro forma earnings per share range (reflecting a full year of earnings contributions from Rhode Island Energy).In addition, PPL announced a 7% increase in its quarterly common stock dividend, raising the dividend from $0.225 per share to $0.24 per share. The increased dividend will be payable April 3, 2023, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2023, and reflects PPL's commitment to dividend growth in line with earnings per share growth.The company reaffirmed its 6% to 8% annual EPS and dividend growth targets through at least 2026 off the midpoint of the 2023 earnings forecast range, or $1.58 per share.PPL also reaffirmed its planned infrastructure investments, targeting $12 billion in improvements from 2023 to 2026 to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and economically replace aging coal generation with reliable, least-cost and clean energy sources. These investments are expected to result in 5.6% average annual rate base growth through 2026, with greater than 7% rate base growth in the back half of the plan.Also as outlined on Jan. 11, PPL has raised its target for annual operation and maintenance savings to at least $175 million by 2026. The expected savings will be driven largely by transmission and distribution operations as PPL continues to deploy scalable technologies and data science across its utility portfolio.The company's plan also continues to support a balance sheet that is among the best in the U.S. utility sector, supporting the company's capital investment plan without the need to issue equity through at least 2026. PPL's credit profile also reflects a projected Funds from Operations (FFO)/Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) to debt ratio of 16% to 18% throughout the planning period.Fourth-Quarter and Year-to-Date Earnings DetailsAs discussed in this news release, reported earnings are calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Reported earnings in 2021 included net special-item after-tax charges of $2.29 billion or $2.98 per share, primarily attributable to discontinued operations of the U.K. utility business sold in 2021, a U.K. tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt.PPL's reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 included special-item after-tax charges of $19 million, or $0.02 per share, primarily attributable to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, partially offset by taxes related to discontinued operations of the U.K. utility business. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 included special-item after-tax charges of $29 million, or $0.04 per share, primarily attributable to integration expenses for the planned acquisition of Rhode Island Energy and discontinued operations of the U.K. utility business.Kentucky Regulated SegmentPPL's Kentucky Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electricity and natural gas operations of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and the regulated electricity operations of Kentucky Utilities Company.Reported earnings in 2022 increased by $0.07 per share compared with a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations in 2022 increased by $0.09 per share compared with a year ago.

Factors driving earnings results primarily included higher operation and maintenance expense and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher sales volumes.Pennsylvania Regulated SegmentPPL's Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of the regulated electricity delivery operations of PPL Electric Utilities.Reported earnings in 2022 increased by $0.13 per share compared with a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.09 per share compared to a year ago. Factors driving earnings results primarily included returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher peak transmission demand, higher sales volumes and share accretion, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense.Reported earnings and earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by $0.01 per share compared with a year ago. Factors driving earnings results primarily included returns on additional capital investments in transmission and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense.Rhode Island Regulated SegmentPPL's Rhode Island Regulated segment consists of the regulated electricity and natural gas operations of Rhode Island Energy, which was acquired on May 25, 2022.The Rhode Island Regulated Segment reported a net loss of $0.06 per share since the acquisition in May and reported earnings of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. The net loss since May, as well as fourth-quarter results, reflected integration expenses and related costs associated with the acquisition, which were treated as special items. Adjusting for the special items, PPL's earnings from ongoing operations increased $0.08 per share since acquisition and $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter due to the addition of Rhode Island Energy to PPL's ongoing earnings results.Corporate and OtherPPL's Corporate and Other category primarily includes financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, certain non-recoverable costs resulting from commitments made to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office in conjunction with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, and certain other unallocated costs.Reported earnings in 2022 increased by $0.79 per share compared with a year ago, primarily attributable to certain special items discussed above. Adjusting for special items, earnings from ongoing operations in 2022 increased by $0.10 per share compared with a year ago.

Earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by $0.03 per share. Factors driving earnings results primarily included lower operation and maintenance expense, lower income taxes and other factors that were not individually significant, partially offset by higher interest expense.2023 Earnings ForecastPPL today reaffirmed its 2023 earnings forecast range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share, with a midpoint of $1.58 per share.Earnings from ongoing operations is a non-GAAP measure that could differ from reported earnings due to special items that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations. PPL management is not able to forecast if any of these factors will occur or whether any amounts will be reported for future periods. Therefore, PPL is not able to provide an equivalent GAAP measure for earnings guidance.See the tables at the end of this news release for a complete reconciliation of reported earnings to earnings from ongoing operations, including an itemization of all special items.About PPLPPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL), based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a leading U.S. energy company focused on providing electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably to 3.5 million customers in the U.S. PPL's high-performing, award-winning utilities are addressing energy challenges head-on by building smarter, more resilient and more dynamic power grids and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions.

Per Investopedia, “[d]ividend aristocrats are stocks of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.” Several of these enterprises have raised them for far longer, providing confidence for investors.Fundamentally, the most undervalued dividend aristocrats may come in hand this year due to lingering uncertainties. While speculation about a gradual return to normal lift equities for the year so far, questions started to pop up. In particular, a robust labor market implies that the Federal Reserve may still need to raise rates significantly.Plus, we have geopolitical tensions rising throughout the world, sending jitters into the financial system. While the most undervalued dividend aristocrats don’t provide perfect mitigation, they offer significant insulation. Below are seven ideas with analyst support to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAFLAflac$71.01DOVDover$155.70ABBVAbbVie$153.73PNRPentair$56.54GDGeneral Dynamics$232.88EMREmerson Electric$86.91ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.90Aflac (AFL)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAn American insurance company, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) specializes in supplemental insurance. In fact, per its public profile, it’s the largest such provider in the nation. Because of its all-around relevance, AFL performed well. In the trailing year, shares gained 7% of equity value.At the moment, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.4%. To be sure, it’s not the greatest amount among undervalued dividend stocks to buy. For instance, the underlying financial sector’s average yield stands at 3.18%. However, the company commands an impressive 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Plus, its payout ratio sits at 27.78%, providing confidence regarding sustainability.Story continuesObjectively, the market prices AFL at a trailing multiple of 10.64. As a discount to earnings, Aflac ranks better than 57% of its peers. Also, the company enjoys a strong net margin of 21.69%, adding to its overall appeal.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg AFL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target pings at $72.11, implying over 3% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid candidate for most undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Dover (DOV)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comBased in Illinois, Dover (NYSE:DOV) is a conglomerate manufacturer of industrial products. So far this year, DOV delighted stakeholders. Since the January opener, shares popped up over 13%. However, it still has some work to do. In the trailing year, DOV gave up more than 4% of equity value.Be that as it may, DOV makes for an interesting case for undervalued dividend aristocrats, particularly for investors that don’t want to rock the boat. Currently, Dover carries a forward yield of 1.32%, admittedly a low rate of passive income. The industrial sector’s average yield stands at 2.36%. However, Dover commands 67 years of consecutive dividend increases. Furthermore, its payout ratio is subterranean at 20.61%.According to data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices DOV at a trailing multiple of 20.63. As a discount to earnings, Dover ranks better than 51.47% of its competitors. Moreover, the company features above-average stats for revenue growth and net margin. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg DOV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $158.92, implying 3.7% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOne of the largest biopharmaceutical companies, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) generally performed well during the post-coronavirus pandemic new normal. In the trailing year, ABBV gained 7% of equity value (though the price action was choppy). Further, in the trailing five years, shares gained 28%. However, since the January opener, ABBV slipped more than 6%.Still, investors might consider the red ink as an opportunity among undervalued dividend aristocrats. Presently, AbbVie offers a forward yield of 3.89%. Conspicuosly, this ranks much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, AbbVie enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. To note, AbbVie spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013.Objectively, the market prices ABBV at a trailing multiple of 20.3. As a discount to earnings, AbbVie ranks better than 53.54% of the competition. Also, ABBV trades hands at 12.41-times forward earnings, coming in below the sector median of 15.27 times.Right now, analysts peg AbbVie as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $163.50, implying 7.53% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth consideration for undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Pentair (PNR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA water treatment company, Pentair (NYSE:PNR) might not be one of the most well-known examples of undervalued dividend aristocrats. However, its relevance has served the company well recently. In the last six months, PNR gained over 11% of equity value. And since the January opener, shares moved up more than 22%.Like some of the more conservative plays among undervalued dividend aristocrats, Pentair represents a don’t-rock-the-boat type of investment. Presently, its forward yield pings at 1.59%. That’s noticeably lower than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. However, Pentair commands 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Moreover, its payout ratio sits at 21.9%, a very sustainable metric.Financially, the market prices PNR at a trailing multiple of 19.1. As a discount to earnings, Pentair ranks better than 54.12% of its peers. Also, PNR trades hands at 15.5-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 18.87 times. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg Pentair as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $60.50, implying almost 10% upside potential.General Dynamics (GD)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is an aerospace and defense corporation. As of 2020, the company represented the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world by arms sales. Cynically speaking, relevancies associated with geopolitical flashpoints helped boost GD in 2022 while other securities struggled. However, GD dipped over 6% in the year thus far.Nevertheless, contrarians might view this as an opportunity to pick up undervalued dividend aristocrats. Currently, General Dynamics offers a forward yield of 2.16%. This stat just slips below the industrial sector’s average yield. Interestingly, GD represents a relatively new entry among the dividend aristocrats, featuring 26 years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, this circumstance implies that management won’t be too quick to give up this hard-earned status.Objectively, the market prices GD at a trailing multiple of 19.12. As a discount to earnings, General Dynamics ranks better than 70.93% of its rivals. Also, GD trades at 18.38-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 20.79 times. Finally, covering analysts peg the defense contractor as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $272.50, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Emerson Electric (EMR)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased in Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is a multinational corporation that manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial and consumer markets. To be sure, recent developments haven’t been kind to Emerson. In the trailing year, EMR gave up more than 9% of equity value. Since the Jan. opener, shares slipped nearly 11%.Still, for contrarians, EMR could rank among the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Presently, Emerson carries a forward yield of 2.42%. In this case, the yield just pips the underlying sector’s average value. Impressively, the company commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, its payout ratio is manageable at 45.73%.At time of writing, the market prices EMR at a trailing multiple of 10.89. As a discount to earnings, Emerson ranks better than 76.67% of its sector peers. Other than that, the company enjoys a strong profitability metrics. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg EMR as a consensus moderate buy.

Thanks to its unparalleled relevance, ADM performed well in 2022. During the trailing year, ADM gained over 7% of equity value. And in the past five years, shares almost doubled. That said, this year saw ADM slip over 8% so far.Nevertheless, it’s easy to imagine astute investors targeting ADM as one of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 2.19%. That’s a bit higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Moreover, the company features 51 years of consecutive dividend increases and a payout ratio of 26.74%.Right now, the market prices ADM at a trailing multiple of 10.65.

Keep up with Dustin Lynch: WEBSITE | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | INSTAGRAM | YOUTUBE | TIKTOKAbout Kat &amp; AlexFor as much as Kat &amp; Alex embody classic country stylings and values, the Nashville-based duo also rewrite the rules altogether with a Latin twist. The husband-and-wife pair shake up country with full-bodied soulful delivery, engaging live instrumentation, and bilingual lyrics, introducing themselves as Nashville’s most compelling outliers. Kat is a Miami native and first-generation American from a Cuban family. Alex, who is of Puerto Rican descent, grew up in Northwestern Georgia and moved to Miami by middle school. Their paths crossed after Kat witnessed Alex singing one day at their church, and the two quickly forged an eternal bond after meeting up to collaborate. They appeared on American Idol individually before returning home to focus on writing and recording original music as a duo, and then made their way to Nashville in 2020, igniting a life-altering couple of years. Last year Kat &amp; Alex released Side A of their self-titled, debut EP, which featured songs such as ""I Want It All"" and ""We Bought A House."" The duo then made history by releasing Lado B, an entirely Spanish version of the EP. The project received acclaim in The Tennessean, Billboard, CMT and others. Kat &amp; Alex were named to Nashville Lifestyle’s ""Most Beautiful People"" list last year, singled out as an Emerging Latin Artist to Discover by Billboard, and deemed ""well on their way to stardom"" by People Magazine. This year, the pair continues representing Hispanic culture in country music with a sound that’s rich and soulful with velvet harmonies, pop-like vocal riffs, and hooky lyrics.KatandAlex.com | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | YouTubeView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230216005529/en/ContactsFlyteVuBrittany Rashkin(561) 314-5359brittany.rashkin@flytevu.comTractor Supply CompanyMary Winn Pilkington(615) 440-4212mpilkington@TractorSupply.comTricia Whittemore(603) 219-6088corporatecommunications@tractorsupply.com]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$2.8b last week. However, the 59% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Occidental Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Occidental Petroleum already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Occidental Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Occidental Petroleum is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 21%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10% and 6.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.We also observed that the top 6 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Occidental Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$100m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 21% of Occidental Petroleum stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

334,f728bd25-af13-3dcc-9fa4-6ba03a222615,OXY,2023-02-17,Energy stocks see lackluster start to 2023,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/energy-stocks-see-lackluster-start-153336083.html,1676561616,VIDEO,"['XOM', 'COP', 'CVX', 'XLE', 'OXY']","[Yahoo Finance Live’s Ines Ferre breaks down the energy sector's returns so far in 2023.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JULIE HYMAN: Are energy stocks missing out on the rally we've seen thus far this year? Markets continuing their climb-- or they have been, despite still strong inflation and Fed hawkishness. But energy is a notable sector that has been underperforming broader indices, despite record profits and a strong 2022. Yahoo Feh-- Our Ines Ferré has been digging into why. So what's going on here, Ines?INES FERRÉ: Yeah, Julie, we've seen year-to-date a little bit of the opposite of what we saw last year. So energy last year was really the outperformer. XLE up 53% for 2022, while technology, consumer discretionary, those high-growth names were really getting beaten up.If you look at our YFi Interactive board right now, this is a daily chart of our sectors. But I'm gonna pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see. Consumer discretionary, communication, technology, those are the big gainers for the years-- or for year-to-date. And XLE is up 0.6% year-to-date.Now, that's compared to the S&amp;P 500 that's up about 8% year-to-date, the NASDAQ up about 15% year-to-date. So just to give you a little bit of context on this. Even though the sector has underperformed the broader markets, on an individual name basis, you have some of these stocks that have recently hit 52-week highs.So the energy stocks are coming from a really high level. You've got ExxonMobil up 4% year-to-date. And this stock had hit its 52-week high earlier in February. But why the muted action compared to the high-growth names? Well, oil has been rangebound. You've got WTI that's been between the low 70s and about 80. Brent Crude has been between-- in the high 70s and about $88 a barrel.And the China re-opening, that has not been up and to the right yet. It is something that's not linear. But it is very bullish for energy stocks and for energy as a whole. It's expected that almost half of the oil demand growth this year is going to come from China.Story continuesNow, we've also seen a recent build in US crude inventories. That's also put pressure on oil prices. But look, the forecast for this year, make no mistake, is that oil is going to be more expensive coming into the summer months and really coming into that big China re-opening.BRAD SMITH: So Ines, what are analysts expecting for energy stocks then for the rest, the remainder of 2023?INES FERRÉ: Yeah, look, I spoke to one strategist, John Navellier, he's a friend of Yahoo Finance. He's been on the show before. He said, look, I overwhelmingly support energy stocks and prefer energy stocks compared to technology stocks. He said that's simply because energy is forecasting better revenue and earnings for 2023.And he also said, look, technology is struggling. Even though we have seen a large rise when it comes to semis-- Semis are doing well. He does like the cloud space, as well. But if he's got to choose between energy and tech, which you've seen tech really outperforming so far year-to-date, he says he'd stick with energy.JULIE HYMAN: Interesting. He's not the only one either. Thanks so much, Ines. Appreciate it.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Coterra Energy (CTRA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.17 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on February 22, 2023.Coterra Energy's Earnings ESP sits at 1.77%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15.CTRA is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Occidental Petroleum, which is readying to report earnings on February 27, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.75 a share, and OXY is 11 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Occidental Petroleum is $1.74, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.24%.Story continuesCTRA and OXY's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Accretive acquisitions also buoy optimism. Yet, unfavorable currency movement and a tough competitive landscape in the large medical device market pose a tough challenge for it. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 7.4% against the industry’s 38% decline.Boston Scientific ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with revenues in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments were up in the reported quarter.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteGeographically, the U.S. business grew 10% year over year with particular strength in WATCHMAN, Endoscopy and urology business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis.The above-market growth was supported by the company’s ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution. Asia Pacific grew 10% operationally. In Latin America, the momentum continued with operational sales growth of 16% in the fourth quarter.The 2023 guidance seems bullish, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.Meanwhile, we are impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term.Boston Scientific recently announced its plans to buy a majority stake in M.I. Tech and Acotec, as well as the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery, which are all expected to close in the first half of 2023. M.I. Tech is expected to widen Boston Scientific’s Neuromodulation product line. The Acotec portfolio is expected to expand Boston Scientific’s drug-coated balloons offerings. Apollo Endosurgery will add a complementary and innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio for the company.Story continuesOn the flip side, during the fourth quarter of 2022, Boston Scientific’s adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain challenges. These macroeconomic headwinds were generated from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances, primarily related to direct material cost and availability with a smaller portion attributable to increased labor costs.Mounting costs are putting pressure on the company’s gross margin. Gross margin in the fourth quarter contracted 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 68.8%. There was a 4.1% rise in the cost of products sold.According to Boston Scientific, its 2023 guidance assumes macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds to be similar to 2022.Continued foreign exchange headwinds largely offset the company’s top-line performance. For 2023, Boston Scientific projects an approximate 100 bps headwind from foreign exchange on its top line.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

Whelton told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""That, unfortunately, has been one of the lessons learned from this incident — state, federal, and local officials haven't been forthright and transparent enough with the population.""Reports of a lingering odor in the area, thousands of fish deaths in local creeks, and animals falling ill have added to mounting skepticism of the cleanup efforts.East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway addresses members of the media as community members gather to discuss their safety and other environmental concerns at a town hall meeting following a train derailment that spilled toxic chemicals, in East Palestine, Ohio, U.S., February 15, 2023. REUTERS/Alan FreedThe residents of East Palestine voiced their frustrations at a public meeting on Wednesday, particularly when Norfolk Southern (NSC), which operated the derailed train, elected to not attend.""I'm just as frustrated,"" East Palestine's Mayor Trent Conaway said at the meeting. ""I live in the community, just like you. I'm trying to get answers. I cannot force them [Norfolk Southern] to be here.""Updates on the derailment have traveled up to the federal government, which is primarily responsible for regulating railroads. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said that he spoke with President Biden over the phone and that Biden offered to help, but DeWine has not taken the president up on his offer.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg weighed in on the situation in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Thursday, stating that ""the most urgent thing right now is to make sure that these residents get the information that they need. They're concerned, they’re frightened, and with good reason.""Story continuesMap highlighting Village of East Palestine, Columbiana County, Ohio. (Wikimedia Commons)What happened in East Palestine, Ohio?Around 9 p.m. ET on February 3, a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in the village of East Palestine near the Pennsylvania border. Of the train's 150 cars, 38 derailed and caught on fire. Eleven of the cars that derailed contained hazardous materials.None of the three rail workers on board were hurt in the derailment and subsequent fire.The contents of the cars, which weren't made known to the public until nine days after the incident, included industrial chemicals such as vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, and benzene. These compounds are commonly found in plastics and adhesives, but can still be toxic at high concentrations.The release of vinyl chloride, which is a known carcinogenic, was of particular concern to health officials. When burned, vinyl chloride can react with the air to produce hydrochloric acid and phosgene gas, a poisonous irritant used in World War I, though the extent of such reactions in the atmosphere is unclear.A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains, Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, file)Roughly 4,800 people in Ohio and Pennsylvania were evacuated due to health risks from the chemical spill. Some residents were even threatened with arrest for not complying.In the following days, crews on the scene grew concerned about the temperature in some of the tankers. Officials, in consultation with Norfolk Southern and the National Guard, opted to do a ""controlled release"" and burn off the chemicals on Feb. 6.“It was clear at that point that we were faced with two bad options,” Gov. DeWine said at a press conference, explaining that if the cars were left alone, there was a ""high probability"" that an explosion would occur, sending shrapnel flying for ""close to a mile.""""There were just terrible decisions you had to make,"" echoed Purdue's Lyle. ""One was you allow the rail cars to explode on their own, and then gaseous clouds move through the community. Or the other one is try to do some type of controlled release and combustion. It was just a tremendously challenging issue.""However, in a letter to Norfolk Southern CEO, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro accused the company of putting “the safety of our first responders and residents at significant risk” in its response and coordination of the chemical release.Drone footage shows the freight train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, February 6, 2023. NTSBGov/Handout via REUTERSNorfolk Southern initially donated $25,000 to aid the residents of East Palestine and set up a ""family assistance center"" in the community. The company later established a $1.2 million fund of financial assistance.In the meantime, the rail line returned to service on Feb. 7 and Norfolk Southern began working on clearing the backlog of rail traffic.Several lawsuits on behalf of Ohio and Pennsylvania residents have been filed to cover damages and long-term medical testing.Residual health concerns after Ohio train derailmentAccording to Whelton, the top concern now will be figuring out the extent of pollution in the air, water, and soil, while making sure that residents aren't substantially harmed by it.The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) estimated that 3,500 fish in local creeks died in the first couple of days after the incident. Other reports surfaced of dead chickens and pets, though ODNR stated it found no evidence that non-aquatic life had died.Brittany Vargo and Marcus Turner sit at an assistance center, following a train derailment that forced people to evacuate from their homes, in New Waterford, Ohio, U.S., February 6, 2023. REUTERS/Alan FreedThe EPA acknowledged that contaminants were detected in the Leslie Run and Sulphur Run, and that butyl acrylate had made its way into the Ohio River. A plume of chemicals from the initial spill is also making its way down the Ohio River at 1 mile per hour, which has fed into growing concerns among populations downriver.The EPA also stressed that its testing has not indicated water quality issues for those in East Palestine as well as populations downstream.Ohio EPA Chief Tiffani Kavalec stated that the agency detected ""very low levels"" of volatile organic compounds in the Ohio River and that these compounds will continue to be diluted over time. Although the Ohio River basin covers an area with 25 million people, many cities and towns have reservoirs and rely on water sources other than the Ohio River.Ohio officials did encourage East Palestine residents to use bottled water for a short period of time, particularly for those who get their water from private wells, until further testing could be completed. And on Wednesday, DeWine announced that East Palestine's municipal water system contained no contaminants and was safe to drink.Becky Rance, center, and Waddle Colley hand out water in downtown East Palestine, Ohio, as the cleanup of portions of a Norfolk Southern freight train that derailed over a week ago continues, Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)Derailment fuels railroad scrutinyThe disaster has brought fresh scrutiny to the lean operations and lax federal regulation of railroads.In a statement, Norfolk Southern said the derailment was caused by a mechanical failure on one of the car's axles. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is currently conducting an investigation into the matter.Sec. Buttigieg stated the Transportation Department is ""paying very close attention"" to the NTSB's findings and that “Norfolk Southern will have to answer to EPA for the environmental side and to our department if there were any violations of rules that were found.”Although the train derailment in East Palestine has been particularly catastrophic, train derailments are not that uncommon. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, there have been around 1,000 train derailments each year for the past three years, a number which has been coming down in recent decades but is still elevated.Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg delivers his remarks during the event. (Photo by Kyle Mazza/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Railroads are largely regulated at a federal level, which created friction in the initial response to the disaster.“This train was not considered a high hazardous material train — therefore the railroad was not required to notify anyone in Ohio about what was in the rail cars coming through our state,” DeWine said in a press conference. “This is absurd, and we need to look at this, and Congress needs to take a look at how these things are handled.”After two deadly derailments in Montreal, Quebec, and North Dakota in 2013 and 2014, respectively, the Obama administration pushed for a new rail safety rule that proposed to change how hazardous materials are classified and require trains to be equipped with advanced braking systems. Industry lobbyists, including Norfolk Southern, fought the rule, which was ultimately watered down to only apply to ""high hazard trains.""Former President Trump overturned the rule in 2018 as part of a wider push to cut regulation, and the Biden administration failed to revive it.The incident has also renewed criticism over the precision scheduled railroad business model — which has been highly profitable for Norfolk Southern — as well as safety concerns amid ongoing job cuts.Gov. DeWine reiterated that Ohio will ensure Norfolk Southern stays until it is cleaned up.""They're going to be held accountable,"" he said.—Grace is an Editor at Yahoo Finance.

Let's get you up to speed now on recent price hikes. You feel them. Paramount combating its rising costs by hiking the price for Paramount Plus. The ad free level, which will now include Showtime, is going from $9.99 to $11.99 per month. While the ad supported tier without Showtime is going from $4.99 to $5.99.Also facing higher cost is Nestle. The company raised prices by 8.2% last year. But this didn't fully offset the impact of increased ingredients costs on its margins. The company's CEO, Mark Schneider, saying on a call with reporters, quote ""Like all the consumers around the world, we've been hit by inflation. And now we're trying to repair the damage that has been done.""And when it comes to Nestle, don't sit there and just think about chocolate, think about Nescafe. Think about Purina quite frankly. And they saw sales volume down 2.6% in the fourth quarter, Shauna.- Yeah. Certainly. It's interesting here just to take a look at the fact that some of these companies certainly diverging paths when it comes to the consumer. Whether or not they're going to continue passing along those price hikes. Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz are two more of those companies that raised prices in 2022. Coca-Cola raised its prices by about 11% last year. The company saying that it's going to continue to raise prices this year. The rival Pepsi, on the other hand, is pausing a price hikes. Kraft Heinz, which raises prices by more than 15% last year, saying that they will not raise prices any further. At least for now. The company actually seeing a drop in sales by volume here. That drop was about 5% in its fiscal fourth quarter because of the price hikes as well as supply constraints.So yes, their numbers on an overall basis, some of them, are impressive. But those volume numbers we've seen them dip at a number of companies. Kraft Heinz being the latest one. And I think consumers are paying closer attention to those price tags. That will be interesting to see whether or not Coca-Cola since they said they will continue raising prices, if they will see more of a backlash here over the coming quarters because of that.- The Fed would like to see some positive story in all of this. They don't yet see it right now. We're talking generally speaking of these companies around a 2% to 3% decrease in volume or demand. And so, yes, the question is going forward, is this the only way they can keep those margins high? And the other question is, are they rising these costs beyond their cost increases? Or is this as some call it, Shauna, greedflation, which is really coming to play. A lot feel, think, with the price of eggs, which are up 70% year over year. And there is a question for the consumer. Are they rising these prices because their supplies, their costs are going up? Or just simply because we will pay it? And these are the questions the Fed needs answered.- Yeah, exactly. And I think we're also getting a clearer picture on who has pricing power and who doesn't this quarter. Just strictly by the numbers. Strictly by the volume. So taking a look at Coca-Cola's latest earnings report, they clearly do have the pricing power. A number of analysts pointing to the fact that Coca-Cola is able to raise prices more than some of its peers just given the strength of their brand. So we'll see whether or not that does hit sales here in the coming quarters.]"

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). CCEP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 14.44 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 20.96. Over the past year, CCEP's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.43 and as low as 11.84, with a median of 14.47.Investors should also note that CCEP holds a PEG ratio of 1.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CCEP's industry has an average PEG of 2.44 right now. Over the past 52 weeks, CCEP's PEG has been as high as 1.59 and as low as 0.96, with a median of 1.28.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

Earnings and sales increased 139% and 15% year over year, respectively.This engineered wood products and plywood company surpassed earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 30.9%.Boise Cascade, L.L.C. Price and EPS SurpriseBoise Cascade, L.L.C. Price and EPS SurpriseBoise Cascade, L.L.C. price-eps-surprise | Boise Cascade, L.L.C. QuoteEarnings &amp; Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boise Cascade’s fourth-quarter earnings has decreased to $2.97 from $3.08 per share in the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 30.3% decrease on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $2.3 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 2.3%.Factors to NoteSlow construction activities are expected to weigh on Boise Cascade’s fourth-quarter 2022 results. While prospects for housing and wood products/timber remain positive in the longer term due to an aging housing stock, underbuilding, increasing household formations and rising incomes, BCC’s quarterly results are expected to have weighed by slowing residential constriction given higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty. The slowdown in the U.S. housing market has been prompting weaker demand for wood products and timber.Nonetheless, the acquisition of Coastal Plywood and its plywood manufacturing operations is likely to have contributed to its performance.Meanwhile, continuing weakness in wood products demand and lower pricing are also likely to have impacted results.Again, supply-chain challenges, higher manufacturing costs and higher input costs (particularly fiber and resin) are expected to have weighed on the quarterly profitability.What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boise Cascade this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher's accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either.

Due to higher utilization of the company's cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company's balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt.

360,efbb9a4c-be2c-3cef-b72e-79e1d5e94c6f,INTU,2023-02-17,Time for Long-Term Investors to Buy these Beaten-Down Tech Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-long-term-investors-buy-221010548.html,1676585410,STORY,['INTU'],"[The Nasdaq is up 15% through the middle of February. Wall Street’s risk appetite grows as investors price in cooling inflation and a near-term earnings bottom. Tesla, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and others have all soared over 50% to start 2023.The tech-heavy index is now comfortably back above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages (and its 50-week and 200-week). Plus, the Nasdaq still trades about 25% below its peaks and technology will without a doubt keep on dominating our lives and the economy.Still, some investors might be nervous to chase these stocks, and perhaps rightfully so, as their valuations get stretched further. Thankfully, many strong technology stocks have underperformed the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 YTD and aren’t yet overheated.  The two stocks we dive into today operate rather unique businesses within the wider technology ecosystem that should help them continue to expand for years to come.Both stocks are also financially sound and sit at somewhat attractive entry points that should help investors with long-term horizons feel comfortable buying even if the market and tech stocks face near-term selling pressure after the huge rally.  Intuit Inc. (INTU) and Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) both report their earnings results during the week of February 20. Let’s dive into why investors might want to buy these stocks, or at least put them on their watchlists to scoop up depending on how their reports and guidance shake out.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit Inc. (INTU) – (Reports Q2 FY23 Results on Feb. 23)Intuit is the software titan behind TurboTax, as well as various accounting software, and small business money management tools. Intuit spent the last several years deepening its roster to make it more attractive to a wider swath of consumers and business clients. INTU bought Credit Karma in December 2020 and Mailchimp in November 2021.Alongside TurboTax, accounting, and other financial services, Inuit now provides email marketing, digital-ad services, customer-relationship-management tools, credit scores, and other personal financial services. Intuit, which currently boasts over 100 customers worldwide, grew its revenue between 11% and 32% during the past seven years and posted only two tiny YoY sales dips over the last 25 years.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for Intuit’s sales to climb another 11% in both FY23 and FY24 to help lift its adjusted EPS by 15% and 13%, respectively. Intuit’s consistent double-digit growth highlights how essential its software is and everyone knows taxes, accounting, and marketing aren’t going anywhere no matter what the future holds. INTU lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its earnings outlook has held up rather well. It also boasts a strong history of earnings beats.Intuit has easily doubled the Zacks tech sector over the last 10 years, up 515% vs. 210%. Intuit’s outperformance is even more pronounced during the last 20 years, blowing away Microsoft and others. Intuit got hit hard alongside all things growth, with it trading 40% from its peaks.INTU is up around 6% YTD to help it climb above its 50-day and 200-day. INTU is also sitting right at neutral RSI levels even as the Teslas of the world reach overbought territory. Intuit trades at 43.1X forward earnings. This is hardly cheap, but it matches its own eight-year median and marks a 50% discount to its own highs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe software power has a strong balance sheet, pays a dividend, which it raised by 15% last summer, and it had $3 billion remaining on its share repurchase program at the end of last quarter.And  Wall Street remains extremely bullish on the stock, with 16 of the 18 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.”Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) – (Reports Q4 FY22 Results on Feb. 22)Garmin is likely best known for its consumer-centric GPS systems, having been at the cutting-edge of the modern consumer-focused GPS movement and market for years. The firm’s in-car navigation systems, fitness wearables, smartwatches, and more are staples in our connected world. Garmin also makes far more high-tech offerings that go way beyond the everyday consumer.Garmin sells high-end fish finders, advanced radars and systems for airplanes and boats. GRMN even has deals to supply science fiction-sounding tech to flying taxis companies. The Switzerland-based firm’s diverse and compelling offerings helped GRMN post six-straight years of revenue growth, with double-digit expansion in the trailing three years. Fiscal 2021 was Garmin’s best showing in over a decade, posting 19% revenue expansion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe boom times couldn’t go on forever and the firm is taking its lumps as its sales “continue to normalize following two years of pandemic-driven growth.” Garmin’s adjusted 2022 earnings are projected to slip 15% YoY as it comes up against a very difficult to compete against stretch on 3% lower revenue that would see it hit $4.85 billion (vs. $3.35 billion in FY18). Garmin is then projected to bounce back and post 4% higher sales in FY23 to top FY21 and 6% stronger earnings. Garmin’s earnings revisions have held up well recently to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. GRMN has topped our EPS estimates for nearly five years running outside of one small miss.GMRN boasts a strong balance sheet with $7.62 billion in assets, including $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents and only $1.75 billion in liabilities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGRMN shares have climbed 180% in the past 10 years to slightly outpace the S&amp;P 500. Despite the long-term strength, Garmin currently trades 45% under its all-time highs at around $97 per share. Garmin has popped 6% YTD and it recently found support at its 50-day moving average.The selling, mixed with Garmin’s stable outlook has it trading below its 10-year median at 18.4X forward earnings. Plus, Garmin’s dividend yields 3% and it trades 16% beneath its average Zacks price target. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The pace of approvals has accelerated as Europe has shifted away from Russian gas since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.About a dozen developers hope to make final investment decisions (FID) this year. Many of these projects have been delayed several times, but analysts said at least three have secured enough customers to move ahead soon.The United States was long an importer of LNG, but natural gas discoveries and production from the shale revolution flipped the country into an LNG exporter in 2016. U.S. LNG exports hit 10.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2022, making the country the second biggest LNG exporter behind Australia.READY TO LAUNCHProjects best positioned to move ahead include Sempra Energy's Port Arthur plant in Texas, Energy Transfer LP's Lake Charles in Louisiana and NextDecade Corp's Rio Grande in Texas.They have all or most of the long-term LNG sales agreements needed to convince bank's that the projects are ready for debt financing, say analysts.Sempra said in January it has sold all the capacity needed to advance the first phase of Port Arthur. Buyers include Poland's Polski Koncern Naftowy Orlen SA, U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips and Germany's RWE AG.NextDecade has signed deals for about 64% of the first phase of Rio Grande and may soon push it to about 87%, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, a bank. Rio Grande's customers include Exxon Mobil Corp, Shell PLC, Portugal's Galp Energia and Japan's Itochu Corp.Story continuesNextDecade could secure a financial go-ahead in the second half of this year, Morgan Stanley said. NextDecade has said that it was targeting a first-quarter FID for the project's first phase.Energy Transfer signaled on Wednesday it might miss its first-quarter target for a FID due to extreme competition for LNG buyers. It has deals to sell LNG to several firms, including Shell, China's ENN Group and Swiss commodity trader Gunvor.It takes roughly four years to build these giant plants, so their LNG is not likely to reach markets before 2027. But their production volumes will allow the United States to remain ahead of output from Australia and Qatar.SUPPLY ADDITIONSThe United States already has the capacity to produce the most LNG in the world and would have been the biggest exporter if not for the shutdown of Freeport LNG's plant in Texas after a fire in June 2022.""The United States still sits atop the ranking of global LNG supply additions through 2030 ... followed by Qatar, Mozambique, and Canada,"" analysts at energy consultancy Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co said in a note.The United States should export around 11.8 bcfd this year and 12.6 bcfd next, estimates the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The seven U.S. export plants already in service, including Freeport LNG, can turn about 13.8 billion cubic feet of gas into LNG each day.The next U.S. LNG plants expected to open are the QatarEnergy-Exxon joint venture at Golden Pass in Texas in late 2024, the first phase of Venture Global LNG's Plaquemines in Louisiana in 2024-2026, and Cheniere Energy Inc's expansion at its Corpus Christi plant in Texas in 2025.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 0.9%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials Vulcan Materials' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Vulcan Materials was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 4.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 38%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendVulcan Materials Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.04, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 45% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Vulcan Materials hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years. Earnings growth is slow, but on the plus side, the dividend payout ratio is low and dividends could grow faster than earnings, if the company decides to increase its payout ratio.Vulcan Materials Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings declined despite revenue improvement.The nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates saw solid growth in aggregates-led business amid a challenging macro-environment. Focus on the operating disciplines and strong pricing actions to overcome inflationary pressures was more than offset by abnormally wet and cold weather that disrupted construction activity and materials shipments, along with soft single-family residential demand.Share of the company plunged almost 7% in the pre-market trading session on Feb 16, after the earnings release.VMC’s chairman and CEO, Tom Hill, said, ""Despite these disruptions, our industry-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased 11 percent in the fourth quarter. We carry solid pricing momentum into 2023 and are focused on our operating disciplines to manage costs and improve efficiencies.  By controlling what we can control, we expect to deliver another year of earnings growth.""Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $1.08 per share missed the consensus mark of $1.29 by 16.3% and declined 13.6% from the year-ago level of $1.25.Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vulcan Materials Company Quote Total revenues of $1,732 million lagged the consensus mark of $1,819 million by 4.8% but increased 7.8% year over year.Segments in DetailAggregatesRevenues from the segment increased 9.3% year over year to $1,259.3 million, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) declined 6.1% year over year. The lingering effects of Hurricane Ian in early October slowed shipments in certain southeastern markets and significant rainfall and extreme winter temperatures impacted November and December construction activity across many markets. The absence of tons available from the company's Mexico operations, which were unexpectedly and arbitrarily shut down by Mexico government in May 2022 added to the negatives.Freight-adjusted average sales price rose 14% to $16.96 per ton (15% on a mix-adjusted basis) from the prior-year level of $14.91. Freight-adjusted revenues rose 6.7% from the prior-year quarter to $918.7 million. Challenging weather conditions, continued energy cost headwinds and inflationary pressures for many parts and supplies in the fourth quarter were partially offset by solid operational execution.Gross profit of $327 million inched up from prior year’s levels despite lower shipments due to unfavorable weather.Story continuesAsphalt, Concrete and CalciumRevenues from the Asphalt segment were $238.1 million, up 20.6% year over year. The segment generated a solid gross profit of $17 million compared with $5 million a year ago on higher pricing. Volumes fell 2% year over year. Asphalt pricing was up 24%, which offset 24% higher pricing for liquid asphalt.Total revenues from the Concrete segment were $360.5 million, down 2.6% year over year. Gross profit totaled $17 million, down from a year ago due to lower volumes and higher costs for diesel fuel. Shipments fell 15% year over year, but average selling prices increased 14% from the prior-year level.Total revenues from the Calcium segment were up to $2.4 million from the prior-year figure of $1.4 million. The segment reported a gross profit of $1.1 million, up from $0.3 million a year ago.Operating HighlightsSelling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses — as a percentage of total revenues — improved 50 basis points to 7.3% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was down 2.1% year over year to $375 million.2022 HighlightsAdjusted earnings came in at $5.11 per share, reflecting an increase from $5.05 a year ago. Total revenues increased to $7,315 million from $5,552 million reported in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA advanced 12.1% year over year to $1,626 million.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $161.4 million, down from $235 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt was $3,875.2 million at 2022-end, compared with $3,874.8 million at 2021-end.For 2022, capital expenditures were $644 million. On 2022-end, total debt to trailing-12-months adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x, down from 2.7x at the end of 2021. Return on average invested capital was 13.5% on a trailing-twelve-months basis.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, the company anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.725-$1.875 billion and net earnings of $715-$835 million. SAG expenses are expected to be $515-$530 million, with interest expenses of approximately $195 million, depreciation, depletion, accretion, and amortization expense of nearly $610 million, and an effective tax rate of 22%.In the Aggregates segment, cash gross profit per ton is likely to improve from the 2022 level of $7.83. Total shipments is likely to be down 2-6%, freight-adjusted price growth is likely to range within 11-13% and freight-adjusted cash cost is estimated to increase high single digit.In Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segment, cash gross profit is expected to be in line with 2022. Asphalt is anticipated to grow on low single-digit growth in volume and price. Also, it is expected to contribute 40-50% of non-aggregates cash gross profit in 2023.Concrete same-store volumes are expected to decline in the mid-single-digit due to slow residential construction activity. Price growth will likely offset the higher raw material cost and will contribute approximately 50-60% of non-aggregates cash gross profit. In 2023, the company expects to have capital expenditures of $600-$650 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesOwens Corning currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

This compares to earnings of $1.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -16.28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this construction materials company would post earnings of $1.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of 4.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Vulcan , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $1.73 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.81%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.61 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Vulcan shares have added about 11.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8%.What's Next for Vulcan?While Vulcan has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vulcan: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

373,92dd69da-4432-3ba5-91db-8b85c4b2804f,VLO,2023-02-17,Valero Energy (VLO) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-considered-good-143002579.html,1676557802,STORY,['VLO'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Valero Energy (VLO).Valero Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.23 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.6% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VLOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VLOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Valero Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Valero Energy, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is VLO Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Valero Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 17.5% over the past month to $23.77.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Valero Energy may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

374,0acd5718-7404-324b-970d-f928161c2e1d,VLO,2023-02-17,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-trending-140002374.html,1676556002,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has gained 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +198.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +37.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $23.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.5%. This estimate has changed +17.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.55 indicates a change of -30.4% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +33.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $33.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.9%. The $148.81 billion and $136.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.6% and -8.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $41.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $8.45 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.04%. The EPS surprise was +13.42%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Drugs like Keytruda and Gardasil (HPV vaccine) have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck's ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda's loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. -12.0%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.Thermo Fisher's accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientifichere &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Express have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry's decline of -17.7%. Due to higher utilization of the company's cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the company's margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise, hurting the bottom line. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, American Express have adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, enhancing existing features, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.The company's balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt.

THO, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corp. VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ.5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Inflation Blows Hot AgainThe U.S. equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past few trading sessions as inflationary pressures refused to abate, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than expected in January. The latest data revealed that CPI was up 0.5% in January following a 0.1% rise in December compared to broad-based expectations of a 0.4% increase. This, in turn, signified that inflation was still a force to reckon with and offered further ammunition to the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against it.A few days earlier, Fed had raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they can benefit from ""cash cow"" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. THOR Industries, Inc., CNH Industrial N.V., Valero Energy Corp., Hologic, Inc. and Suzano S.A. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:THOR Industries: Founded in 1980, Indiana-based Thor Industries is the largest manufacturer of RVs in the world.

Let’s take a closer look at each one.The Coca-Cola CompanyCoca-Cola is an American multinational corporation best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. The company’s earnings outlook has drifted higher as of late, helping land KO into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, KO is a Dividend King, showing an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.The company’s annual dividend presently sits at 2.9%, modestly above its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, KO’s 42.3% trailing twelve-month return on equity (ROE) is well above the Zacks sector average of 23.5%, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profit from existing assets compared to peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble (often called P&amp;G) is a branded consumer products company that markets its products primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, and others.

If you want to see more best stocks to buy for investment, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment.While different people have different opinions on what the best stocks for investment are, a decent number of investors think the stocks of leading companies with substantial competitive advantages whose shares are generally less volatile could be good candidates.Less volatile stocks generally don't move as much as the broader stock market does because the future financial performance of less volatile stocks is arguably more predictable. There are certain times where less volatile stocks can be more volatile, however, such as during earnings.Less volatile stocks include leading consumer staples whose demand doesn't change all that much in more challenging economic times. Some less volatile stocks are conglomerates or have multiple leading brands. As a result of having multiple different businesses or multiple different brands, the overall company's results might not change as much as the results of an individual business or individual brand do.Many of the same leading stocks with generally lower betas also have fair growth prospects due to various reasons. For some companies, they might have decent growth potential in faster growing emerging markets such as India. For other companies, they might be repurchasing a lot of their stock. If a company buys back substantial shares and doesn't issue any new shares, its EPS could grow even if its overall earnings stay the same.Although they might have fairly predictable businesses, individual stocks might still underperform if a company makes a bad acquisition, for instance, or if its overall market demand isn't as strong as expected. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.In terms of 2023, many of the leading lower beta stocks have not rallied as much as the market has year to date. In some instances, the lower volatility stocks have declined year to date as individual company earnings have not be as strong as expected. Nevertheless, analysts do expect the leading consumer staples conglomerates mentioned in this article to grow in the long term.Story continuesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment, we picked 10 stocks that have lower betas than the overall market and that have decent growth potential according to their EPS next 5 Year Ratio.We ranked each of the 10 stocks based on their market capitalization as of 2/15.For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Stocks to Buy for an 18 Year Old.10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investment10.

Learning from the asset's past performance leads to better decision-making when developing a roadmap for its future.IES integrates physics-based simulation with the 3D model, real-time operational data, machine learning and AI to provide unique insights which will be allied to Eaton's expertise in power management to devise high-performance strategies for building decarbonisation, energy efficiency improvement and energy cost reduction.Delphine Clement, commercial and industrial buildings segment leader at Eaton in EMEA, said: ""With IES's expertise in buildings physics, we can show our customers how their buildings will perform before and during their energy transition journey. They will be able to examine the costs and benefits of various options to boost sustainability to help them better understand and de-risk the investments they need to make.""Don McLean, Founder and CEO of IES said: ""Digital twins will be key to our work with Eaton because they respond and behave like their real-world counterparts, translating data into essential decision support information. For Eaton's customers, we will examine how a building is used, with a focus on both energy efficiency and user comfort, before constructing a digital twin to forecast the potential energy savings and payback periods of various applications of Eaton's Buildings as a Grid approach.""Story continuesEaton's Buildings as a Grid approach transforms buildings into energy hubs that support EV charging and renewable energy generation. The aim is to help commercial building owners save money on energy bills and prepare their properties to comply with net-zero regulations.Explaining further, Clement added: ""Electricity generation is changing, and so is how we store and manage power. Transport is changing, and with more EVs on the road we need to charge them efficiently without overloading power networks. This represents both opportunity and risk for building owners. Getting electrification right will preserve the value of their buildings, as well as provide building users with a greater degree of energy self-sufficiency.""This ambition accords fully with the ethos of IES: ""The built environment accounts for almost 40% of global emissions and we're working to get that down to zero,"" said Don McLean. ""Our agreement with Eaton will help to deliver highly energy efficient commercial and industrial buildings.""About Eaton Eaton is an intelligent power management company dedicated to improving the quality of life and protecting the environment for people everywhere. We are guided by our commitment to do business right, to operate sustainably and to help our customers manage power ─ today and well into the future. By capitalizing on the global growth trends of electrification and digitalization, we're accelerating the planet's transition to renewable energy, helping to solve the world's most urgent power management challenges, and doing what's best for our stakeholders and all of society.Founded in 1911, Eaton is marking its 100th anniversary of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Per Investopedia, “[d]ividend aristocrats are stocks of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.” Several of these enterprises have raised them for far longer, providing confidence for investors.Fundamentally, the most undervalued dividend aristocrats may come in hand this year due to lingering uncertainties. While speculation about a gradual return to normal lift equities for the year so far, questions started to pop up. In particular, a robust labor market implies that the Federal Reserve may still need to raise rates significantly.Plus, we have geopolitical tensions rising throughout the world, sending jitters into the financial system. While the most undervalued dividend aristocrats don’t provide perfect mitigation, they offer significant insulation. Below are seven ideas with analyst support to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAFLAflac$71.01DOVDover$155.70ABBVAbbVie$153.73PNRPentair$56.54GDGeneral Dynamics$232.88EMREmerson Electric$86.91ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.90Aflac (AFL)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAn American insurance company, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) specializes in supplemental insurance. In fact, per its public profile, it’s the largest such provider in the nation. Because of its all-around relevance, AFL performed well. In the trailing year, shares gained 7% of equity value.At the moment, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.4%. To be sure, it’s not the greatest amount among undervalued dividend stocks to buy. For instance, the underlying financial sector’s average yield stands at 3.18%. However, the company commands an impressive 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Plus, its payout ratio sits at 27.78%, providing confidence regarding sustainability.Story continuesObjectively, the market prices AFL at a trailing multiple of 10.64. As a discount to earnings, Aflac ranks better than 57% of its peers. Also, the company enjoys a strong net margin of 21.69%, adding to its overall appeal.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg AFL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target pings at $72.11, implying over 3% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid candidate for most undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Dover (DOV)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comBased in Illinois, Dover (NYSE:DOV) is a conglomerate manufacturer of industrial products. So far this year, DOV delighted stakeholders. Since the January opener, shares popped up over 13%. However, it still has some work to do. In the trailing year, DOV gave up more than 4% of equity value.Be that as it may, DOV makes for an interesting case for undervalued dividend aristocrats, particularly for investors that don’t want to rock the boat. Currently, Dover carries a forward yield of 1.32%, admittedly a low rate of passive income. The industrial sector’s average yield stands at 2.36%. However, Dover commands 67 years of consecutive dividend increases. Furthermore, its payout ratio is subterranean at 20.61%.According to data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices DOV at a trailing multiple of 20.63. As a discount to earnings, Dover ranks better than 51.47% of its competitors. Moreover, the company features above-average stats for revenue growth and net margin. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg DOV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $158.92, implying 3.7% upside potential.AbbVie (ABBV)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockOne of the largest biopharmaceutical companies, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) generally performed well during the post-coronavirus pandemic new normal. In the trailing year, ABBV gained 7% of equity value (though the price action was choppy). Further, in the trailing five years, shares gained 28%. However, since the January opener, ABBV slipped more than 6%.Still, investors might consider the red ink as an opportunity among undervalued dividend aristocrats. Presently, AbbVie offers a forward yield of 3.89%. Conspicuosly, this ranks much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, AbbVie enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. To note, AbbVie spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013.Objectively, the market prices ABBV at a trailing multiple of 20.3. As a discount to earnings, AbbVie ranks better than 53.54% of the competition. Also, ABBV trades hands at 12.41-times forward earnings, coming in below the sector median of 15.27 times.Right now, analysts peg AbbVie as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $163.50, implying 7.53% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth consideration for undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy.Pentair (PNR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA water treatment company, Pentair (NYSE:PNR) might not be one of the most well-known examples of undervalued dividend aristocrats. However, its relevance has served the company well recently. In the last six months, PNR gained over 11% of equity value. And since the January opener, shares moved up more than 22%.Like some of the more conservative plays among undervalued dividend aristocrats, Pentair represents a don’t-rock-the-boat type of investment. Presently, its forward yield pings at 1.59%. That’s noticeably lower than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. However, Pentair commands 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Moreover, its payout ratio sits at 21.9%, a very sustainable metric.Financially, the market prices PNR at a trailing multiple of 19.1. As a discount to earnings, Pentair ranks better than 54.12% of its peers. Also, PNR trades hands at 15.5-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 18.87 times. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg Pentair as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $60.50, implying almost 10% upside potential.General Dynamics (GD)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is an aerospace and defense corporation. As of 2020, the company represented the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world by arms sales. Cynically speaking, relevancies associated with geopolitical flashpoints helped boost GD in 2022 while other securities struggled. However, GD dipped over 6% in the year thus far.Nevertheless, contrarians might view this as an opportunity to pick up undervalued dividend aristocrats. Currently, General Dynamics offers a forward yield of 2.16%. This stat just slips below the industrial sector’s average yield. Interestingly, GD represents a relatively new entry among the dividend aristocrats, featuring 26 years of consecutive dividend increases. Still, this circumstance implies that management won’t be too quick to give up this hard-earned status.Objectively, the market prices GD at a trailing multiple of 19.12. As a discount to earnings, General Dynamics ranks better than 70.93% of its rivals. Also, GD trades at 18.38-times forward earnings, below the sector median of 20.79 times. Finally, covering analysts peg the defense contractor as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $272.50, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Emerson Electric (EMR)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased in Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is a multinational corporation that manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial and consumer markets. To be sure, recent developments haven’t been kind to Emerson. In the trailing year, EMR gave up more than 9% of equity value. Since the Jan. opener, shares slipped nearly 11%.Still, for contrarians, EMR could rank among the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy. Presently, Emerson carries a forward yield of 2.42%. In this case, the yield just pips the underlying sector’s average value. Impressively, the company commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, its payout ratio is manageable at 45.73%.At time of writing, the market prices EMR at a trailing multiple of 10.89. As a discount to earnings, Emerson ranks better than 76.67% of its sector peers. Other than that, the company enjoys a strong profitability metrics. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg EMR as a consensus moderate buy.

Thanks to its unparalleled relevance, ADM performed well in 2022. During the trailing year, ADM gained over 7% of equity value. And in the past five years, shares almost doubled.

Moreover, the company features 51 years of consecutive dividend increases and a payout ratio of 26.74%.Right now, the market prices ADM at a trailing multiple of 10.65.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders have enjoyed a 61% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 48% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 8.4% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, PepsiCo managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PepsiCo has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think PepsiCo will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of PepsiCo, it has a TSR of 86% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that PepsiCo has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 8.4% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 13% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(PEP) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-pep-trending-stock-140002111.html,1676556002,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this food and beverage company have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has lost 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.22 points to a change of +6.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.81 indicates a change of +8.2% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.11 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $89.12 billion and $93.67 billion estimates indicate +3.2% and +5.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $1.67 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.83%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”11. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,021,337,000 Dividend Yield as of February 16: 1.90% Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 51Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical device company that also provides healthcare services to its consumers.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10. NIKE, Inc.

Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”9.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Marilyn Mora: Welcome everyone to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise.All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.Story continuesI will now turn it over to Chuck.Chuck Robbins: Thanks, Marilyn. I hope everyone is doing well. With the tremendous results we delivered in the first half of the year, fiscal 23 is shaping up to be very strong, fueled by demand for our cloud-driven networking portfolio, our continued business transformation success and an improving supply situation, thanks in large part to our team's aggressive actions. Before I dive into additional details on the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the team here at Cisco. While the environment we are operating in remains dynamic, Cisco is better positioned today than at any time since I became CEO almost 8 years ago. We have reshaped and transformed the company and our portfolio while remaining highly disciplined both financially and operationally.This gives me great confidence that we will continue to succeed in the long-term. Now I will touch on the quarter in more detail. Our Q2 financial results were strong as we again exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges. We delivered our second highest quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion, up 7% and record non-GAAP EPS at $0.88. We also delivered solid ARR growth, sequential non-GAAP margin expansion and record non-GAAP net income. In terms of our business model shift, we continue to make great progress with 10% growth in software revenue and with software subscription revenue up 15%. Recurring revenue also now represents 44% of our total revenue. In addition, we have built up nearly $32 billion in remaining performance obligations and our backlog remains robust.Even as we drew down backlog by 6% sequentially, our total backlog still grew year-over-year. These metrics, along with our increasing visibility, led us to raise our full year outlook, which Scott will address in a moment. This quarter, we also achieved record operating cash flow, enabling today's dividend increase and the buyback of over $1 billion. We continue to deliver on our commitment to drive returns to our shareholders. Let me also provide an update on the supply situation. While components for a few product areas remain highly constrained, we did see an overall improvement. Combined with the aggressive actions our supply chain and engineering teams took to redesign hundreds of our products, we increased product deliveries and saw significant reductions in customer lead times.As our product deliveries increased, channel inventories also declined as our partners were able to complete customer projects. Like I shared last quarter, as supply constraints ease and lead times shorten, we expect orders would normalize from previously elevated levels as customers return to more typical buying patterns. As a result, sequential quarterly order growth is a better indicator than year-over-year growth. And in Q2, despite improving lead times, our quarter-over-quarter order growth was again in line with our historical ranges across most of our geographies and customer markets. With that, let me touch on what we are seeing with customer demand. In our customer markets, we experienced normal double-digit sequential growth in both our enterprise and commercial markets, while public sector performed better than we have seen historically.Within our service provider business, our order rate was below recent sequentials as some customers are absorbing the improved delivery of our products into their production environments. We saw another consecutive quarter of rapid adoption of our 400-gig Cisco 8000 and Silicon One platforms. This reflects the ongoing investments our customers are making in our innovative solutions and AI optimized infrastructure. Within web-scale, while we saw overall slowing due to normalizing product lead times, two of our largest customers grew their orders with us over 40% in the first half of fiscal 23. We continue to take share in this space. And over the past few years, we have grown web-scale cloud infrastructure from effectively zero into a multibillion dollar run-rate business.I am incredibly pleased about the overall progress we've made as we are continuing to win more and more use cases within their infrastructure. We are also still at the beginning of what we believe to be a massive growth opportunity going forward. While we continue to closely monitor the global macroeconomic conditions, the overall demand environment remains steady and on par with Q1 and our pipeline and win rates remains stable. Looking at the broader landscape, digital transformation and hybrid cloud remain top areas of spend, which is fueling growth across our portfolio. Many customers have told me that while their spend levels maybe slowing in some areas technology remains essential as it is vital to their overall business resilience, competitive differentiation and success.In fact, Gartner and IDC's most recent surveys make it clear that technology budgets are growing as they forecast IT spend to increase in the mid to high single-digits in 2023. We are also seeing many customers moving ahead with their hybrid work, AI and ML investments while building the modern infrastructure they need to deliver on their objectives. IoT has also been accelerating. We saw record revenue growth in Q2 as customers look to connect their industrial systems in order to optimize power consumption, automation and efficiency. Lastly, cybersecurity and full stack observability remains strategic priorities where we continue to invest and innovate. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strong double-digit growth for Catalyst 9000, enterprise routing, Wireless, Meraki, DUO and ThousandEyes, reflecting the ongoing investments our customers are making to modernize their infrastructure to rapidly digitize and secure their organizations.We are increasing our investments in our cloud management platforms that deliver the simplicity our customers need. You will see us continue to bring AI and ML into those platforms to further simplify how networks are managed. For example, in Q2, we announced several new innovations across our cloud managed networking and security portfolios that offer greater visibility with AI-driven insights, enable secure connectivity, and give our customers the ability to simplify their IT operations. Last week, we introduced a preview our cloud-native full stack observability platform, the first network visibility solution to support open telemetry. This platform brings together our ThousandEyes and AppDynamics capabilities for unmatched data correlation and insights from the user to the application to the network.To simplify network security and policy management, our unified SASE solution, Cisco+ Secure Connect, now supports integration into Cisco SD-WAN fabrics using Viptela technology, as well as our existing Meraki SD-WAN fabric. We also introduced new flexible, more powerful and energy-efficient servers, which not only help lower cost, but also help our customers meet their sustainability goals, an increasingly critical area for most of our customers. To close, I am proud of what we achieved this quarter. We delivered a strong financial performance, innovated across our portfolio and continue to make great progress on our business transformation. In addition, the increased visibility we have from almost $32 billion in RPO, a healthy backlog and pipeline and improving supply give us the confidence to raise our full year outlook.We expect those same factors to continue into fiscal year 24, giving us conviction in our ability to deliver on our commitments. The modern, resilient and secure networks we are building serve as the backbone of our customers' technology strategy. Cisco is well-positioned to benefit from multiyear investment cycles with our market-leading hardware as well as our innovative software and services. Together, these allow our customers to digitize rapidly, secure their environments and achieve their sustainability goals, all while delivering differentiated experiences. Now, I will turn it over to Scott.cisco, valley, silicon, logo, network, switch, tech, provider, business, sign, symbol, infrastructure, hub, technology, computer, equipment, computing, bone, electronic,Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comScott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We delivered another strong quarter and exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by our focused execution, continued success of our business transformation and improved availability of supply as the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters are bearing fruit. Total revenue was $13.6 billion, up 7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share, also a record, was $0.88. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 2%. Within product revenue, secure Agile Networks performed very well, up 14%. Switching revenue grew in the double-digits with strength in campus switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings.While data center switching declined slightly, we saw strong growth in our Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing had double-digit growth driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth with strength across the entire portfolio. Internet for the Future was down 1%, driven by declines in optical and Edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and double-digit growth in web-scale. Collaboration was down 10%, driven by declines in meetings and collaboration devices, slightly offset by growth in contact center. End-to-end security was up 7% driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. Optimized application experiences, was up 11%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering ThousandEyes.We made solid progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.3 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 11%. Total software revenue was $4.2 billion, an increase of 10%, with software subscription revenue up 15%. 84% of the software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 4 percentage points, year-over-year. We continue to have $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6 billion, an increase of 9%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of total revenue. And RPO was $31.8 billion, up 4%. Product RPO increased 7% and service RPO increased 2%, and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion.While total product orders were down 22%, they compared against 34% growth in Q2 fiscal 22, which is one of the largest quarters for product orders in our history. We saw year-over-year declines across our geographies and customer markets. Sequentially, total product order growth was in line with our historical growth rates. Within our customer markets, we experienced double-digit sequential growth in both enterprise and commercial and public sector was better than we have seen historically. We continue to have very low order cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 63.9%, down 160 basis points and up 90 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 62.1% down 220 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially.Service gross margin was 69.1%, up 30 basis points. In our product gross margin, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher component and other costs. This was partially offset by our strong product mix and positive pricing as the benefits of the actions we took in the prior fiscal year flowed through as we shift our backlog. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high-end of our guidance range at 32.5%, down 180 basis year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher component and other costs that I just mentioned. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to drawdown total backlog by 6% sequentially, although it still grew year-over-year.Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $31.8 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $22.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $4.7 billion, up 93% year-over-year driven by strong collections and we deferred our Q2 federal tax payments due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods. We expect to pay these federal taxes by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases.We also ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in remaining stock repurchase authorization. Today, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.39 per share, which represents our 13th consecutive increase. This reinforces our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders annually and confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we had a great quarter, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom line performance. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance, our guidance ranges reflect our strong pipeline and significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO and improving availability of supply as we continue to benefit from the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters.We expect those same factors will continue into fiscal 2024 giving us greater visibility and confidence in our longer term goals. For fiscal Q3, our guidance is: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 11% to 13%; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%; our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%; and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0.98. There is also a significant change to our full year fiscal 23 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance driven by these same factors. For fiscal year 23, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 10.5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.73 to $3.78.In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&amp;A.Marilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott.

""There are at least whispers now of the possibility of a 50 basis point hike at the next meeting.""After a selloff in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed about 7% so far in 2023, fueled by upbeat earnings and cautious expectations the U.S. central bank has completed the brunt of its rate hike campaign.The Fed is seen pushing the benchmark rate above the 5% mark by May and keeping it above those levels till the year-end.Also on Thursday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said inflation remains too high, and noted that she was open to raising rates by more than what her colleagues wanted at the last monetary policy meeting. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said continued rate increases will ""lock in"" slowing inflation, even with continued economic growth.Story continuesSelling on Wall Street accelerated late in the session.
