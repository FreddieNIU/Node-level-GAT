2,8ad3eeab-1f57-3272-96bc-bc16def5fc97,NUE,2023-07-05,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Nucor Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-nucor-123004712.html,1688473804,STORY,['NUE'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Nucor (NUE) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NUE for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Nucor's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nucor's main business drivers.Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, Nucor Corporation is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck and cold finished bars in the United States. It also produces direct reduced iron (“DRI”) that is used in its steel mills. The company has 123 operating facilities, primarily in the United States and Canada. Also, most of its operating facilities and customers are located in North America.Over the years, the company has grown through acquisitions as well as by tapping new markets and expanding geographically. Through its network of “mini-mills”, the company produces steel sheets, bars, plates as well as various structural and other products. Nucor, in 2014, completed the acquisition of Gallatin Steel Company from global steel giant ArcelorMittal and Brazilian steel maker Gerdau for roughly $770 million in cash. Notably, the company is North America’s largest recycler, which uses scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products.Nucor operates in three segments – the Steel Mills segment (23.2 million shipments in 2022), the Steel Products segment and the Raw Materials segment. The Steel Mills segment manufactures hot rolled steel products such as angles, rounds, flats, channels, rebar, sheets, wide-flange beams, pilings, billets, blooms, beam blanks, and plates; and cold-rolled steel products. The Steel Products segment makes steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light gauge steel framing among other products. The Raw Materials segment produces direct reduced iron, ferrous and nonferrous metals, and pig iron; ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap from the facility in Trinidad.  Story continuesNucor sells its hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel to steel service centers, fabricators, and manufacturers; steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators; and cold finished steel and steel fasteners to distributors and manufacturers. Its steel products are used in highways, bridges, reservoirs, utilities, hospitals, schools, airports, stadiums and high-rise buildings.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nucor, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $3,802.76, or a gain of 280.28%, as of July 4, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 175.82% and the price of gold went up 47.81% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for NUE.Earnings estimates for Nucor for the second quarter have been going up over the past month. The company is committed to expand its production capabilities and grow its business through strategic acquisitions. Its efforts to boost production capacity through a number of growth projects should drive profitability. Nucor is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market, which is driving its steel products unit. It is also seeing strong demand in the heavy equipment market. The company also remains focused on achieving greater penetration in automotive. Higher steel prices and higher end-market demand should also drive its margins. However, the company faces challenges from higher input costs due to supply constraints. Its high debt level is another concern. The steel industry is also reeling under oversupply.Shares have gained 17.50% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

3,b7dca11f-3977-3429-933e-a176c9a676b1,ARE,2023-07-05,Here's Why You Should Retain Alexandria (ARE) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-alexandria-stock-134200724.html,1688478120,STORY,"['ARE', 'EGP']","[Amid the growing need for drug research and innovation, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s ARE portfolio of high-quality, niche assets — life science, technology and agtech properties — in strategic markets is well-poised to benefit from this elevated demand.Alexandria’s Class A properties are situated in North America's AAA innovation cluster locations, with a significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Reflecting the robust demand for its high-quality office/laboratory space, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 1.2 million rentable square feet (RSF) of space in the first quarter of 2023. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to 1.1 million RSF.Alexandria registered rental rate growth of 48.3% during the reported quarter, which marked the highest quarterly rental rate growth in the company’s history. On a year-over-year basis, same-property net operating income (NOI) was up 3.7%. Given its solid operating platform, this upbeat trend is likely to continue.To enhance its operating platform, Alexandria has been focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations. In the first quarter of 2023, ARE completed acquisitions totaling 1.1 million RSF of value-creation opportunities for a total price of $171.9 million. Also, ARE placed into service development and redevelopment projects totaling 453,511 RSF across multiple submarkets, which resulted in $23 million of incremental annual NOI.Moreover, Alexandria’s encouraging development pipeline bodes well for its long-term growth. Its 6.7 million RSF value-creation pipeline is anticipated to generate more than $610 million of incremental NOI, mainly starting from the second quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2026.On the balance sheet front, ARE had $5.3 billion of liquidity as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. Further, as of the first-quarter end, the company had no debt maturities before 2025, and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.4 years. With a strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and ARE has remained committed to that. In June 2023, it announced a 2.5% sequential hike in its second-quarter 2023 cash dividend.Alexandria has increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.79%. Given the company’s solid operating platform, our adjusted funds from operations (FFO) growth projections of 12.6% for 2023, a decent financial position and a lower payout ratio compared with that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.However, Alexandria’s huge development and redevelopment pipeline, although encouraging for growth, exposes it to the risks associated with rising construction costs and lease-up concerns.Further, a high interest rate is a concern for Alexandria. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 6.1% in the past three months against its industry’s growth of 0.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP and Innovative Industrial Properties IIPR, each presently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EastGroup Properties’ current-year FFO per share has moved marginally north over the past two months to $7.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Innovative Industrial Properties’ 2023 FFO per share has moved 3.6% upward in the past two months to $8.66.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Between 2020 and 2021, the insured population in the US grew by almost 900,000.

Since the initial comments by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), its stock has gained over 3.7%.UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) predicts that health insurance costs could rise by $250 million to $500 million in 2023 alone due to pickleball-related injuries.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global gambling industry, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Gambling Cities in the World. In a previous article, we covered the 12 most profitable casinos in the world. In this article, our focus will be on cities that experience high levels of gambling activity. Before digging into the list, we will take a look at some major gambling markets across the globe.Gambling Markets Across The GlobeGambling is a big business globally and casinos exist in almost every country. The United States leads the race of the most casinos in the world. According to the WorldCasinoDirectory, the U.S. has 2,147 licensed casinos and 619 casino hotels, across 920 gambling cities. According to the American Gaming Association, the gambling market in the U.S. contributes nearly $261 billion to the economy annually and supports 1.8 billion jobs across the country. Following the United States, Romania leads the race with the most casinos in the world with a total of 454 casinos. Then we have the Czech Republic, Spain, and the United Kingdom with 423, 314, and 309 casinos, respectively. Other notable countries that have a prominent gambling industry include China, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Slovakia.Two Gambling Hubs – Las Vegas and MacaoLas Vegas, Nevada is one of the most populated casino cities in the world by number of casinos. As per the WorldCasinoDirectory, Las Vegas has 170+ casinos and 90+ casino hotels in the city. Whereas, Nevada as a whole has 404 licensed casinos and 178 casino hotels across 45 gambling cities in the state. According to the American Gaming Association, Nevada posted a monthly commercial gaming revenue of $1.15 billion in commercial gaming revenues for April 2023. Nevada was the only state that posted revenue that exceeded $1 billion, while all other states' monthly revenue for April 2023 was in millions. Story continuesIn comparison, Macao has 49 casinos and 58 casino hotels. Macao is a major contributor to the global gambling industry. On June 2, Reuters reported casino revenues in Macao soared 366% year over year to $1.93 billion in May 2023. Las Vegas and Macao are only two of the biggest gambling cities in the world.A Growing Internet Gambling MarketThe internet gambling market is experiencing healthy growth worldwide. According to a report by ResearchandMarkets, the global online gambling market was worth $63.53 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $153.57 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% between 2023 and 2030. The surge in smartphone usage and internet penetration has paved the way for casino gaming platforms.The gambling industry has experienced significant growth over the years, propelled by advancements in technology and changing societal attitudes towards gambling. Some of the biggest gambling companies in the world include Las Vegas Sands Corp.(NYSE:LVS), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM). Let's see how the financial performance of casino companies has fared so far in 2023.Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) posted a strong beat in Q1 2023. On May 9, the company reported an EPS of $0.29 and surpassed EPS estimates by $0.32. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.42 billion, up 49.34% year over year and ahead of analysts' estimates by $58.73 million.After a strong quarter, Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is looking for growth opportunities in the gambling market. Here are some comments from its Q1 2023 earnings call:""We have a number of growth projects in flight that require capital and will ultimately add meaningful EBITDA to our business. But with Macau returning to profitability and North America continuing to perform well above historical levels, we have sufficient financial flexibility to also return capital to shareholders.Turning to Las Vegas. I have to tell you, it's a fascinating time in our business. Despite the confluence of high inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and increasingly difficult year-over-year comps, Wynn Las Vegas delivered an all-time record in Q1 with $232 million of adjusted property EBITDA, supported by a consumer that continues to feel flush. We also subsequently delivered the best April in the history of the property. We continue to invest heavily in people, programming and the building to further distance ourselves as the clear leader in luxury in Vegas.Looking ahead, we currently have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power, healthy drop in handle and a robust programming calendar, particularly in the back half of the year. Yet I continue to watch the macro factors that I mentioned earlier, and I will note that, with Q2 2023, we will begin comping against some very strong prior year quarters. Lastly, just as I have the past several quarters, I will continue to tell you exactly what we're seeing. And right now, things feel good around here.""20 Biggest Gambling Cities in the WorldCopyright: sainaniritu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyWe identified 50 well-known cities that experience the highest level of gambling activity.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, is down about 7% as of July 5, closing at $76.25 on July 4.Mortgage Interest Rate Forecast for 2023: When Will Rates Go Down?However, oil and natural gas prices climbed after the short-lived Russian insurrection at the end of June, and although the challenge to the 23-year rule of Vladimir Putin seems to have ended, it sparked debate over whether further turmoil could disrupt supply and inflate prices.“This seemingly attempted coup only brings uncertainty, which could be reflected through into higher prices,” said Kpler lead Americas oil analyst Matt Smith after the Wagner Group rebellion that began on June 23.“Such upheaval and uncertainty as we have seen in recent days could bring support to prices given the potential for supply disruptions — and the fear of them,” Smith added.There is still much to be resolved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with both sides promising offensives and retribution this summer. These actions could fall directly in line with peak seasonal consumption and pricier summer gas blends.Add in supply affected by depressed oil inventory levels, ongoing OPEC-initiated oil production cuts and the lifting of COVID restrictions by China, and Americans could be looking at a series of surprisingly expensive trips to the gas station over the next couple of months. Andy Lipow, of Lipow Oil Associates, explained the dichotomous nature of the oil market’s future path to Yahoo Finance, saying, “The events in Russia lead the market to consider how much Russian oil production and exports could have been affected if Wagner took more territory or if Russia fell into a civil war.”Story continues“A contrarian view is that this is bearish [for] the oil markets because Putin will try to export every bit of Russian oil he can sell in order to raise money to pay off his supporters and keep the army on his side,” he added.A Russian collapse or an end to the war in Ukraine in the near future could provide some stability and hope to a volatile energy market that has been turned upside-down since Putin launched his invasion last February. Further unrest, on the other hand, could seriously impact oil and gas prices this summer, when demand is expected to outpace supply.https://www.gobankingrates.com/category/money/economy/This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Summer Gas Prices: How the Unrest in Russia Could Impact What You Pay at the Pump]"

On Wednesday, benchmark Brent futures almost flat at $76.30 per barrel as of 1440 GMT, remaining below the $80-$100 per barrel that most OPEC nations need to balance their budgets.OPEC says it does not have a price target and is seeking to have a balanced oil market to meet the interests of both consumers and producers.The United States, the biggest oil producer outside OPEC+, has repeatedly called on the group to boost production to help the global economy and has criticised Saudi cooperation with Russia after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.But Riyadh has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. calls and Prince Abdulaziz said on Wednesday that new joint oil output cuts agreed by Russia and Saudi Arabia this week have again proven sceptics wrong.""Part of what we have done (on Monday) with the help of our colleagues from Russia was also to mitigate the cynical side of the spectators on what is going on between Saudi and Russia on that specific matter,"" Prince Abdulaziz said.""It is quite telling seeing us on Monday coming out with not only our (oil cut) extension... but also with validation from the Russian side,"" he told a meeting of oil industry CEOs with ministers from OPEC and allies, known as the OPEC International Seminar.Story continuesOPEC has withheld media access to reporters from Reuters, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal to cover the event, which was partly broadcast online.After the end of the broadcast, Prince Abdulaziz told the seminar that OPEC+ would do ""whatever necessary"" to support the market, according to a source who attended the meeting.ENOUGH FOR NOWThe International Energy Agency has said it expects the oil market to tighten in the second half of 2023, partly because of OPEC+ cuts.Amin Nasser, boss of energy giant Saudi Aramco, said he was optimistic about demand growth in the mid-term as the Chinese economy and global jet fuel consumption were still recovering from their decline during the pandemic.But analysts at Morgan Stanley on Wednesday cut their oil price forecast, saying that while they anticipated a decrease in stocks in 2023 they forecast a surplus in the first half of 2024, with non-OPEC supply growing faster than demand.Additional oil cuts should be enough to help balance the oil market, United Arab Emirates' energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told reporters on Wednesday.""This (the latest addition output cuts) is enough to assess the market and look at the market balance,"" Mazrouei told reporters.He said the UAE would not be contributing to fresh cuts as it was already producing well below its capacity.""There’s a bigger thing… I’m seeing a lack of investments in many countries. We will have to invite maybe newcomers to come and join the group. The more countries we have... the easier the job... to ensure that the world has enough oil in the future,"" Mazrouei said.""Imagine if we had 60% of the producers or 80% of the producers... We will definitely do a better job.""(Reporting by OPEC Newsroom; writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Louise Heavens, Jason Neely and Jan Harvey)]"

Going into the release, futures markets are 80% priced for another quarter-point policy rate rise to 5.5-5.75% this month and have 33 basis points of hikes pencilled in by November.Story continuesAfter more encouraging data on disinflation during May, a Fed research paper released on Friday showed financial conditions were at their tightest since the banking crash more than a decade ago.Two-year Treasury yields hovered about 4.90% on Wednesday, well back from Monday's 4.96% high. The dollar was steady to firmer, with China's offshore yuan reversing all of Tuesday's gains.U.S. stock futures were down about 0.2% ahead of the bell, with the VIX index of implied volatility popping back above 14 as the new quarter gets underway in earnest.Along with China, and likely affected by it, updated euro zone composite business survey readings for last month showed activity contracting again for the first time this year and producer prices falling at an annual rate of 1.5% in May.The global industrial picture saw crude oil prices slip back again on Wednesday despite fresh attempts by Saudi Arabia and Russia this week to further limit supplies.

13,58172a6c-d527-3fd9-ae74-0d91db01bbcf,O,2023-07-05,Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS) shareholders have earned a 13% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hibiscus-petroleum-berhad-klse-hibiscs-072133037.html,1688541693,STORY,['CL=F'],"[While Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 19% in the last quarter. But over three years, the returns would have left most investors smiling To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 38% during that period.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad was able to grow its EPS at 52% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 11% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 3.25 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's TSR for the last 3 years was 45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 4.4% in the last year, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad shareholders lost 12% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.1% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad  you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.Of course Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad may not be the best stock to buy.

And there is still plenty of time to take the necessary actions in time for the 2025 ban that is proposed in the Skidmore amendment, which we very much welcome.”He said the Government should focus on home insulation and voluntary actions by factories and other industrial businesses to bring down demand for gas in future where possible.Mr Parr added: “The message [at Cop26] that was very strongly put out was that Britain was the first country to have an industrial revolution using coal and will now be the first to get out of it.“Rolling back on that would damage our international credibility on these issues – so we should be pushing forward and putting in place the kinds of legislative commitments that Chris Skidmore is proposing.”Ministers initially said that coal power generation would be legally banned from October 2025.They then brought the cut-off forward by a year in an announcement in the run-up to the Cop26 climate conference in November 2021, when the UK hosted more than 100 world leaders in Glasgow.But the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has since confirmed to The Telegraph that no such law has been passed yet and that it has dropped plans to bring one forward.Kathryn Porter, an energy consultant at Watt Logic, said this could in theory clear the way for the National Grid to keep coal power stations on standby to boost supplies in future winters.With European gas supplies squeezed in the wake of the Ukraine war, the Grid previously kept three coal power stations on standby to provide backup generation last year.One was also fired up in June to boost electricity supplies after sweltering temperatures prompted households to turn on their air conditioners.Those kept online last winter included West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, owned by EDF and Uniper respectively, as well as two coal-fired units at Drax’s power station in Selby, Yorkshire.West Burton A and the Drax units are now being shut down, the companies confirmed.Uniper, meanwhile, has said it intends to run all four of its coal-fired units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar until September 2024.Ms Porter said retaining a small number of coal plants open could boost energy security while having a minimal climate impact.The Government insists it will incentivise the end of coal power, without a legal ban, by making changes to how electricity generators are paid from October 1, 2024.Rules governing the so-called capacity market – a backstop system to ensure there is always enough power – will be changed to make coal generation “uneconomical”, a spokesman said.But this will not actually make coal generation illegal and the rules could be revised without any new acts of Parliament.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The benchmark closed with a $1.60 gain on Tuesday.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude traded at $71.91, up $2.12, or about 3%, from Monday's close.Given there was no settlement on Tuesday because of the Independence Day holiday, trade on Wednesday appeared to narrow the spread between the benchmarks, with WTI catching up with Brent's gains the previous day.""These measures are designed to push oil prices higher, but currently they are being pulled down by macroeconomic anxiety,"" PVM analyst Tamas Varga said of the price impact of the supply cuts.""Some would argue that the latest decision to supply less oil to the market is actually bearish, because it can be viewed as an admission that demand is struggling to grow at a healthy clip due to global economic headwinds.""Recent surveys have shown a slump in global factory activity, reflecting sluggish demand in China and Europe.China's services activity in June expanded at the slowest pace in five months, while euro zone business activity slipped into contractionary territory last month in a broad-based downturn across the bloc's dominant services sector.Market attention is also focused on interest rates, with U.S. and European central banks expected to increase rates further to tame stubbornly high inflation.Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, on Monday said it would extend its voluntary output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to August. Russia and Algeria, meanwhile, are lowering their August output and export levels by 500,000 bpd and 20,000 bpd respectively.Russia-Saudi oil cooperation is still going strong as part of the OPEC+ alliance, which will do ""whatever necessary"" to support the market, Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Wednesday.Morgan Stanley on Wednesday lowered its oil price forecasts, predicting a market surplus in the first half of 2024 with non-OPEC supply growing faster than demand next year.Separately, Kazakhstan's oil output on July 4 plunged by about a fifth from July 2 levels after widespread power outages. Kazakh crude accounts for about 1.7% of global oil production.

For more stocks on this list, head on over to Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks for 20 Years.The world of investments is not for those that are prone to panicking easily. Over a few years, stocks previously believed to be impervious to typical market downturns have experienced significant declines, only to rebound briefly before facing further declines. At the center of this whirlwind, lies the Federal Reserve’s primary policy tool: interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to slow the amount of money circulating through the economy and drive down aggregate demand. With higher interest rates, there should be lower demand for goods and services, and the prices for those goods and services should fall as a consequence. Of course, the Federal Reserve doesn't always increase its interest rates in a linear fashion. Following a streak of 10 consecutive meetings where rates were increased, occasionally by as much as three-quarters of a point per meeting, the Fed decided to forgo the June gathering. In this environment, investors are currently anticipating a resumption of rate hikes in July, with the possibility of the Fed assessing the need for additional increases during alternate sessions, a pace that has been observed in previous periods of tightening.The discussion around a potential economic recession has resurfaced with the participation of another Federal Reserve official in the debate over future interest rate increases. Mary Daly, the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, expressed in an exclusive interview with Reuters that there is a genuine possibility of two additional interest rate hikes occurring within the remainder of this year. In contrast to the previous year, where the risk of uncontrollable inflation outweighed the risk of excessively slowing down the economy, the current situation presents a shift in risks. Now, the risks lie in the potential consequences of taking too little action on interest rates compared to the risks associated with taking too many measures. According to Daly, her community advisory council and other business contacts have consistently expressed their concerns regarding two major issues: persistently high inflation and ongoing labor shortages. The personal consumption expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 4.4%. Although this is a decline from the peak of 7% observed last summer, it still remains more than double the Fed's target of 2%. Additionally, the unemployment rate has slightly increased to 3.7%, which remains lower than the 4% rate estimated by Fed policymakersStory continuesLong-term investment in the stock market is arguably the most reliable method to grow your wealth. Long-term investors disregard the volatile fluctuations of stock markets that occur in the short term. Instead of being entangled in the theatrics, they choose to invest in the stocks of established companies known for their consistent and enduring performance, spanning years, or perhaps even decades. By adopting this approach, investors can shield their investments from temporary headwinds, such as the ones witnessed during the economic downturn of the previous year. As an example, the Nasdaq Composite index experienced a steep decline of 33% in 2022. Nevertheless, due to the alleviation of inflationary pressures, the index has surged by 29.9% year-to-date, resulting in a remarkable 79.65% growth over the past five years, despite recent adversities. As a consequence, investors who withdrew their investments during the market lows of 2022 will miss out on the gradual rebound witnessed this year.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some great stocks for a long term portfolio, out of which the top picks include Meta Platforms, Inc.

Using this information, the stocks were ranked.10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is an American nationwide automotive dealership group headquartered in Medford, Oregon. The third largest new vehicle automotive dealership group in the United States, the company offers a diverse array of services that encompass the purchase of both new and pre-owned vehicles, various vehicle financing alternatives, warranties, insurance plans, theft protection services, as well as comprehensive automotive repair and maintenance solutions. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) has been part of value investor David Abrams portfolio since Q2 2018, signifying his trust in the stock's long-term viability.On April 19, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend, a 19% increase from its prior dividend of $0.42. The dividend was paid on May 26, to shareholders of record on May 12.As of the March quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared with 40 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $1.7 billion.Right Tail Capital mentioned Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The original research premise fit right into Right Tail’s wheelhouse: a set of good businesses trading at attractive long-term valuations. Valuations look inexpensive at mid to high single digit multiples of earnings. Historically, these businesses have traded at 10-15x P/E multiples despite having more leverage and holding more inventory than they do today. In some ways, the historical multiples feel appropriate given their delicate relationships with manufacturers and cyclicality; on the other hand, these businesses have produced solid mid-teens returns with attractive reinvestment opportunities suggesting they are better than average companies. Adding another wrinkle to the puzzle, these businesses have over-earned the last few years due to Covid (car shortages, consumers flush with cash, etc.).As I began the work, the compelling return potential warranted additional research. Lithia Motors (LAD), for example, has laid out a 2025 earnings per share target of $55-60. If the company reaches $55 in earnings and trades at a 12x P/E, we’d have a stock price of $660 – this would be a triple from today’s prices and produce a ~45% IRR over 3 years. The businesses are also producing lots of cash currently (LAD has earned ~$40 per share the last few years) creating additional capital allocation optionality.”Much like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is a top long term stock finding favor with hedge funds.9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), often referred to as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services.

Beyond its flagship beverage, the company engages in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse range of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7.

21,a108d186-e1bf-3167-b7df-8bb8a15a5889,PCG,2023-07-05,Is PG&E Corporation's (NYSE:PCG) ROE Of 8.0% Impressive?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-corporations-nyse-pcg-174241124.html,1688492561,STORY,['PCG'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for PG&amp;E How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PG&amp;E is:8.0% = US$1.9b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.Does PG&amp;E Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that PG&amp;E has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (8.9%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 2 risks we have identified for PG&amp;E visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesPG&amp;E's Debt And Its 8.0% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by PG&amp;E, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.27. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

It is worth considering Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which belongs to the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry.This agribusiness giant has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19.95%.For the last reported quarter, ADM came out with earnings of $2.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 per share, representing a surprise of 22.22%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.93 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.68%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for ADM lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.ADM currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.91%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, has awarded the deal.Valued at $66.1 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by February 2024. Per this contract, Raytheon will provide design engineering, long lead material and hardware, weapon system integration and various other support services for the F135 engine.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in East Hartford, CT.What’s Favoring Pratt &amp; Whitney?Pratt &amp; Whitney, a forerunner in manufacturing aircraft engines for military business jets, enjoys a significant order inflow. The unit has been under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin LMT.F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used in F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements.The strong demand for F-35 leverages Pratt &amp; Whitney to witness a consistent flow of orders for the F135 engine. In this context, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, signifying the parallel demand for the F135 engine that powers this stealth aircraft.Going forward, LMT anticipates F-35 delivery numbers in the band of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024. Lockheed Martin also expects to supply nearly 156 jets in 2025 and beyond.RTX is likely to have its order book full for the production of F135 engines and related support services contracts, like the latest one. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit.Story continuesPeer ProspectsThe tremendous demand that LMT’s F-35 jet enjoys tends to benefit not just RTX but one more defense major that plays a critical role in its manufacturing:Northrop Grumman NOC: The company is accountable for the production of the center fuselage of F-35, along with the design and production of AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radars and the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System and AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation and Identification avionics suite.Northrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

32,d9b6003e-9b0b-3ff3-9e90-eeff1bd7b2e7,SPG,2023-07-05,20 Largest Malls In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-largest-malls-world-213804381.html,1688506684,STORY,"['SPG', 'SITC']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 largest malls in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the retail shopping and mall businesses, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Malls In The World.Are Shopping Malls Becoming Obsolete?To many people, going to the mall to shop or even to just spend some time with family and friends used to be a regular occurrence. Shopping malls have carried the retail industry on their backs for decades, with over half of US retail sales being attributed to malls during the 1980s, according to a research report from the Association for Consumer Research. However, while this may have been true during the 1980s, today, the situation for shopping malls is drastically different in light of e-commerce and online shopping taking the public by storm.According to the United States Census Bureau, US retail sales for 2022 topped $6.5 trillion. A highlight within this area was the performance of online or electronic shopping sales, which increased by 15.4% between 2020 and 2021. Americans spent a little over $1 trillion through electronic shopping in 2021, which was an increase compared to the $891.1 billion value from 2020. This yearly increase shows how online shopping is continuing to grow as a popular trend and an almost necessary part of life for many individuals today, with busier work schedules and less time to physically go to shopping malls for everyday needs.Because of the growing popularity of online shopping, malls may be becoming obsolete. To prevent this from happening, they have to adapt to changing times and make the in-person shopping experience different from how it used to be so it attracts people living in the digital age. Without doing this, mall operators such as Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), Brookfield Property REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:BPR), and SITE Centers Corp. (NYSE:SITC) will begin to feel the heat from their properties failing to do as well as they used to in the past. Some may argue that some of these stocks are already beginning to feel the heat. As of June 29, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is down by 2.37% year-to-date, for example, and this is the mall operator handling some of the largest malls in the US. At the same time, rising interest rates are also not the best news for mall owners as they can make it difficult for retailers to purchase necessary inventory and supplies, among more.Story continuesSome Say Malls May Be Here To StayDespite the above, the current market dynamics are proving shopping mall critics wrong. For instance, while shares of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) may be down year-to-date, the company's first-quarter results and full-year 2023 guidance show that it's actually optimistic about its malls. The occupancy rate at Simon Property Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:SPG) US malls and premium outlet centers was 94.4% by March 31, showing an increase compared to the 93.3% figure from 2022. Secondly, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) also noted that more than 85% of US retail sales still take place in physical stores. This implies that while electronic shopping may be rising, physical shopping is also not falling.One final factor driving up mall operators' success is revenue from lease income. Simon Property Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:SPG) net revenue from lease income rose by 3.3% during the first quarter to $1.25 billion, beating estimates of $1.24 billion. The company raised its 2023 profit and comparable funds from operation per diluted share forecasts based on its first-quarter performance, now expecting annual profits of $6.45 to $6.6 per share. The rising income from the rents charged by mall operators and the increased demand for leasing mall spaces, coupled with shopping mall sales staying up even in the digital age, are all factors that are driving up the hope for shopping malls today. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of the largest shopping malls in the world. These are the top 20 largest malls in the world and include some of the most profitable global malls as well.20 Largest Malls In The WorldOur MethodologyThe malls on our list below have been selected based on the square footage of their floor areas.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.American International Group in FocusBased in New York, American International Group (AIG) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -8.38%. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.36 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.49%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.35% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.44 is up 12.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, American International Group has increased its dividend 1 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 0.68%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, American International Group's payout ratio is 26%, which means it paid out 26% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AIG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.50 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 42.86%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AIG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AFG and American International Group AIG have officially announced the completion of a crucial buyout agreement. American Financial has acquired Crop Risk Services (""CRS""), a primary crop insurance general agent based in Decatur, IL, for a cash consideration of $240 million. AFG used cash on hand to fund the acquisition.CRS is known as the seventh largest provider of multi-peril crop insurance in the United States, with impressive 2022 gross written premiums of approximately $1.2 billion.A Win-Win Deal for AFG &amp; CRSThis strategic acquisition marks a significant milestone for Great American Insurance Group, one of the subsidiaries of American Financial. The inclusion of CRS into the fold will reinforce Great American's position as the fifth largest provider of multi-peril crop insurance in the United States. Moreover, it will solidify its standing as the largest U.S.-owned participant in the multi-peril crop insurance program.Great American Insurance Group has been a key player in the crop insurance market since 1915, providing crop-hail coverage. They expanded their offerings by writing multi-peril crop insurance in 1980, following Congress's authorization of the program. In 2022, Great American's Crop Division generated impressive gross written premiums of approximately $1.8 billion, further cementing its position as a major player in the multi-peril crop insurance segment.As part of AFG, Crop Risk Services will continue its operations in all 37 states it currently serves, promising a seamless transition for its existing clientele and opening up new avenues for growth under American Financial Group's umbrella.Capitalizing on Strategic SynergiesCarl H. Lindner III, co-chief executive officer of AFG, expressed enthusiasm about the deal, citing the exceptional strategic fit between CRS and their existing crop insurance operations. With this acquisition, Great American will gain access to economies of scale, enabling the group to maximize its benefits and broaden its competitive edge in the crop insurance market.Furthermore, AFG's ability to efficiently execute such transactions and allocate excess capital into core businesses highlights its success in identifying niche businesses that meet the targeted return thresholds. Following the acquisition, American Financial Group expects to have substantial excess capital available, opening doors for potential share repurchases or special dividends.Story continuesCrop Risk Services and AIG's JourneyAIG originally acquired Crop Risk Services as part of its purchase of Validus Holdings, Ltd. Since then, CRS has demonstrated impressive growth, thanks to the leadership of a skilled and experienced management team. AIG's chairman and chief executive officer, Peter Zaffino, expressed confidence in AFG as an ideal partner for CRS. Zaffino believes that the scale provided by the acquisition will further enhance the business prospects of CRS.A Legacy of Strategic AcquisitionsAmerican Financial Group has a track record of reaping the rewards of strategic acquisitions.  It is actively involved in startups, small-to-medium-sized acquisitions and product launches. It is prudently investing in businesses.In January 2022, American Financial acquired Verikai, Inc. for $120 million in cash. With this acquisition, Great American Insurance Group, gained a predictive risk tool and unique Marketplace solution from Verikai as it enters the medical stop-loss business. AFG intends to focus on small and underserved risks.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceAFG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

BRO are pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions. Recently, this insurance broker inked a deal to buy Kentro Capital Limited. The acquisition, when it materializes, will boost Brown &amp; Brown’s presence in parts of England.Brown &amp; Brown and its subsidiaries continuously make strategic acquisitions to expand globally, add capabilities and boost operations. Also, these strategic buyouts help Brown &amp; Brown increase commissions and fees, which, in turn, drive revenues. Brown &amp; Brown’s impressive growth is driven by organic and inorganic means across all segments. Consistent operational results have been aiding Brown &amp; Brown in generating solid cash flows for deployment in strategic initiativesArthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG recently acquired Insurance by Ken Brown. The buyout will help AJG consolidate its presence in parts of the United States. Arthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with a number of buyouts in the Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker made 10 acquisitions in the first quarter of 2023 that contributed about $69 million to estimated annualized revenues.AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $300 million of revenues, associated with about 40 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. Revenue growth rates generally range from 5% to 20% for 2023 acquisitions.

AIG recently closed its deal with the well-established financial-services-focused investment management firm, Stone Point Capital LLC. The terms of the deal were kept under wraps.The agreement revolved around AIG’s plans, disclosed in February 2023, to establish a standalone Managing General Agency and shift its Private Client Group (""PCG"") business to the independent platform. The business will also undergo rebranding to Private Client Select Insurance Services.The recent collaboration will offer an opportunity to AIG to leverage Stone Point’s longstanding insurance industry expertise and integrate it with its own risk management capabilities and product know-how. This, in turn, is likely to impart strength to AIG in devising enhanced product offerings and better serve high net worth and ultra high net worth client base.An advanced product portfolio might fetch more customers for AIG and enable it to further strengthen its presence across the promising High and Ultra High Net Worth markets. An increased customer base is likely to provide an impetus to its personal lines insurance business, through which AIG distributes auto, homeowners, umbrella, yacht, fine art and collections insurance to high net worth individuals. The personal insurance unit forms a part of the General Insurance segment, that usually contributes the most to AIG’s top line.The latest agreement with a leading private equity firm like Stone Point bears testament to AIG’s efforts in seeking ways to support the growth prospects of its PCG business with the help of capital support from high-quality investors and capacity providers. In the past, AIG collaborated with the one of the oldest insurance markets in the world, Lloyd’s, to unveil Syndicate 2019 which was entrusted with the responsibility of reinsuring risks from the PCG business. The tie-up offered high net worth clients exposure to enhanced products and risk management solutions offered through the Lloyd’s market.Story continuesWhile collaborations are a means to boost capabilities, AIG also resorts to divestitures in order to intensify focus on further growing the General Insurance unit and shed off its non-core business units.Shares of AIG have gained 13.3% in a year against the industry’s decline of 0.6%.

NXGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and continued demand for its solutions are expected to contribute further. NextGen’s dependence on third-party partners and stiff competition pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 7.5% compared with a 29.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 16.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global provider of innovative and cloud-based healthcare technology solutions has a market capitalization of $1.07 billion.

Robust increases in Subscription services, Managed services and Transactional and data services revenues were also registered. The continued integration of TSI Healthcare also looks promising for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesDependence on Third-Party Partners: NextGen is subject to several risks associated with having a portion of its assets and operations located in India and using third-party service providers in India and other countries. Various factors, such as changes in the current Government of India, could trigger significant changes in India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and NextGen’s business in particular.Stiff Competition: The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive, and NextGen faces significant competition from various sources. Several of its competitors have substantially greater resources, while some of the larger competitors have greater scale than NextGen.

The raised 2023 guidance is a major upside. However, mounting expenses and stiff competition do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has surged 88.5% against a 9.7% decline of the industry and a 18% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $16.84 billion. The company’s next-year expected growth rate of 36.2% compares favorably with the industry’s growth projection of 10%.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ1 Upsides: Exact Sciences exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The quarterly loss narrowed significantly from the year-ago period’s levels. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to first-quarter top line. During the quarter, 10,000 new healthcare professionals ordered Cologuard, bringing the total to over 312,000. The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages. The raised 2023 guidance is another upside.Enhancing Cologuard Growth: The company is currently focusing on three areas to enhance Cologuard growth.  Building the best and most effective commercial organization in healthcare by investing in the leadership team, training, and sales force effectiveness is the first strategy. Secondly, improving the customer experience by making it simpler to order Cologuard electronically and continue rescreening patients every three years. Screening more people starting at age 45 to catch cancer earlier is the final strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer the first-quarter earnings update, the company recently ran next-generation Cologuard on nearly 7,700 blinded DeeP-C samples. The second prospective study will provide valuable evidence supporting next-generation Cologuard's clinical value and competitively unique position. In multi-cancer early detection, it plans to share two additional sets of case-control data this year, validating the comprehensive multi-marker class approach.Story continuesRaised Guidance: The company raised its 2023 revenue guidance to the range of $2.380-$2.420 billion (from the earlier guidance of $2.265-$2.315 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.26 billion.For 2023, the company expects its Screening revenues in the range of $1.770-$1.795 billion ($1.660-$1.690 billion). The company expects Precision Oncology revenues in the range of $605-$620 million ($600-$620 million). COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be $5 million (unchanged).DownsidesEscalating Costs: Exact Science resorted to several strategies to improve its revenue performance. These include portfolio expansion and penetration in the international arena. So far, this has escalated costs and operating expenses for the company.In the first quarter of 2023, Exact Sciences’ general and administrative expenses rose 27.9%. Adjusted operating expenses dropped 0.9% year over year. The escalating costs are exerting significant pressure on the company’s bottom line.Tough Competitive Landscape: Given the large market for colorectal cancer screening, Exact Science faces numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than the company.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exact Sciences’ loss for 2023 has moved 39.1% north to ($2.07).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.41 billion, suggesting a 15.8% rise from the 2022 reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

45,84c13aed-90bd-301d-975d-2ce36bd89810,NOV,2023-07-05,Wall Street Analysts Think Nov Inc. (NOV) Could Surge 51.82%: Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-nov-135506809.html,1688478906,STORY,"['NOV', 'TGT']","[Nov Inc. (NOV) closed the last trading session at $16.25, gaining 4.9% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $24.67 indicates a 51.8% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises 15 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $4.24. While the lowest estimate of $16 indicates a 1.5% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 84.6% to reach $30. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NOV. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NOVThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.9%.Moreover, NOV currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NOV could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global gambling industry, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Gambling Cities in the World. In a previous article, we covered the 12 most profitable casinos in the world. In this article, our focus will be on cities that experience high levels of gambling activity. Before digging into the list, we will take a look at some major gambling markets across the globe.Gambling Markets Across The GlobeGambling is a big business globally and casinos exist in almost every country. The United States leads the race of the most casinos in the world. According to the WorldCasinoDirectory, the U.S. has 2,147 licensed casinos and 619 casino hotels, across 920 gambling cities. According to the American Gaming Association, the gambling market in the U.S. contributes nearly $261 billion to the economy annually and supports 1.8 billion jobs across the country. Following the United States, Romania leads the race with the most casinos in the world with a total of 454 casinos. Then we have the Czech Republic, Spain, and the United Kingdom with 423, 314, and 309 casinos, respectively. Other notable countries that have a prominent gambling industry include China, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Slovakia.Two Gambling Hubs – Las Vegas and MacaoLas Vegas, Nevada is one of the most populated casino cities in the world by number of casinos. As per the WorldCasinoDirectory, Las Vegas has 170+ casinos and 90+ casino hotels in the city. Whereas, Nevada as a whole has 404 licensed casinos and 178 casino hotels across 45 gambling cities in the state. According to the American Gaming Association, Nevada posted a monthly commercial gaming revenue of $1.15 billion in commercial gaming revenues for April 2023. Nevada was the only state that posted revenue that exceeded $1 billion, while all other states' monthly revenue for April 2023 was in millions. Story continuesIn comparison, Macao has 49 casinos and 58 casino hotels. Macao is a major contributor to the global gambling industry. On June 2, Reuters reported casino revenues in Macao soared 366% year over year to $1.93 billion in May 2023. Las Vegas and Macao are only two of the biggest gambling cities in the world.A Growing Internet Gambling MarketThe internet gambling market is experiencing healthy growth worldwide. According to a report by ResearchandMarkets, the global online gambling market was worth $63.53 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $153.57 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% between 2023 and 2030. The surge in smartphone usage and internet penetration has paved the way for casino gaming platforms.The gambling industry has experienced significant growth over the years, propelled by advancements in technology and changing societal attitudes towards gambling. Some of the biggest gambling companies in the world include Las Vegas Sands Corp.(NYSE:LVS), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM). Let's see how the financial performance of casino companies has fared so far in 2023.Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) posted a strong beat in Q1 2023. On May 9, the company reported an EPS of $0.29 and surpassed EPS estimates by $0.32. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.42 billion, up 49.34% year over year and ahead of analysts' estimates by $58.73 million.After a strong quarter, Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is looking for growth opportunities in the gambling market. Here are some comments from its Q1 2023 earnings call:""We have a number of growth projects in flight that require capital and will ultimately add meaningful EBITDA to our business. But with Macau returning to profitability and North America continuing to perform well above historical levels, we have sufficient financial flexibility to also return capital to shareholders.Turning to Las Vegas. I have to tell you, it's a fascinating time in our business. Despite the confluence of high inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and increasingly difficult year-over-year comps, Wynn Las Vegas delivered an all-time record in Q1 with $232 million of adjusted property EBITDA, supported by a consumer that continues to feel flush. We also subsequently delivered the best April in the history of the property. We continue to invest heavily in people, programming and the building to further distance ourselves as the clear leader in luxury in Vegas.Looking ahead, we currently have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power, healthy drop in handle and a robust programming calendar, particularly in the back half of the year. Yet I continue to watch the macro factors that I mentioned earlier, and I will note that, with Q2 2023, we will begin comping against some very strong prior year quarters. Lastly, just as I have the past several quarters, I will continue to tell you exactly what we're seeing. And right now, things feel good around here.""20 Biggest Gambling Cities in the WorldCopyright: sainaniritu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyWe identified 50 well-known cities that experience the highest level of gambling activity.

NextEra Energy (NEE), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7%.For the last reported quarter, NextEra came out with earnings of $0.84 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75 per share, representing a surprise of 12%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.51 per share, delivering a surprise of 2%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for NextEra. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.NextEra currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.47%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

For more stocks on this list, head on over to Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks for 20 Years.The world of investments is not for those that are prone to panicking easily. Over a few years, stocks previously believed to be impervious to typical market downturns have experienced significant declines, only to rebound briefly before facing further declines. At the center of this whirlwind, lies the Federal Reserve’s primary policy tool: interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to slow the amount of money circulating through the economy and drive down aggregate demand. With higher interest rates, there should be lower demand for goods and services, and the prices for those goods and services should fall as a consequence. Of course, the Federal Reserve doesn't always increase its interest rates in a linear fashion. Following a streak of 10 consecutive meetings where rates were increased, occasionally by as much as three-quarters of a point per meeting, the Fed decided to forgo the June gathering. In this environment, investors are currently anticipating a resumption of rate hikes in July, with the possibility of the Fed assessing the need for additional increases during alternate sessions, a pace that has been observed in previous periods of tightening.The discussion around a potential economic recession has resurfaced with the participation of another Federal Reserve official in the debate over future interest rate increases. Mary Daly, the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, expressed in an exclusive interview with Reuters that there is a genuine possibility of two additional interest rate hikes occurring within the remainder of this year. In contrast to the previous year, where the risk of uncontrollable inflation outweighed the risk of excessively slowing down the economy, the current situation presents a shift in risks. Now, the risks lie in the potential consequences of taking too little action on interest rates compared to the risks associated with taking too many measures. According to Daly, her community advisory council and other business contacts have consistently expressed their concerns regarding two major issues: persistently high inflation and ongoing labor shortages. The personal consumption expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 4.4%. Although this is a decline from the peak of 7% observed last summer, it still remains more than double the Fed's target of 2%. Additionally, the unemployment rate has slightly increased to 3.7%, which remains lower than the 4% rate estimated by Fed policymakersStory continuesLong-term investment in the stock market is arguably the most reliable method to grow your wealth. Long-term investors disregard the volatile fluctuations of stock markets that occur in the short term. Instead of being entangled in the theatrics, they choose to invest in the stocks of established companies known for their consistent and enduring performance, spanning years, or perhaps even decades. By adopting this approach, investors can shield their investments from temporary headwinds, such as the ones witnessed during the economic downturn of the previous year. As an example, the Nasdaq Composite index experienced a steep decline of 33% in 2022. Nevertheless, due to the alleviation of inflationary pressures, the index has surged by 29.9% year-to-date, resulting in a remarkable 79.65% growth over the past five years, despite recent adversities. As a consequence, investors who withdrew their investments during the market lows of 2022 will miss out on the gradual rebound witnessed this year.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some great stocks for a long term portfolio, out of which the top picks include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).

We then chose the stock holdings that have remained within some of their portfolios for 5 years or more. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey's survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is an American nationwide automotive dealership group headquartered in Medford, Oregon. The third largest new vehicle automotive dealership group in the United States, the company offers a diverse array of services that encompass the purchase of both new and pre-owned vehicles, various vehicle financing alternatives, warranties, insurance plans, theft protection services, as well as comprehensive automotive repair and maintenance solutions. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) has been part of value investor David Abrams portfolio since Q2 2018, signifying his trust in the stock's long-term viability.On April 19, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend, a 19% increase from its prior dividend of $0.42. The dividend was paid on May 26, to shareholders of record on May 12.As of the March quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared with 40 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $1.7 billion.Right Tail Capital mentioned Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The original research premise fit right into Right Tail’s wheelhouse: a set of good businesses trading at attractive long-term valuations. Valuations look inexpensive at mid to high single digit multiples of earnings. Historically, these businesses have traded at 10-15x P/E multiples despite having more leverage and holding more inventory than they do today. In some ways, the historical multiples feel appropriate given their delicate relationships with manufacturers and cyclicality; on the other hand, these businesses have produced solid mid-teens returns with attractive reinvestment opportunities suggesting they are better than average companies. Adding another wrinkle to the puzzle, these businesses have over-earned the last few years due to Covid (car shortages, consumers flush with cash, etc.).As I began the work, the compelling return potential warranted additional research. Lithia Motors (LAD), for example, has laid out a 2025 earnings per share target of $55-60. If the company reaches $55 in earnings and trades at a 12x P/E, we’d have a stock price of $660 – this would be a triple from today’s prices and produce a ~45% IRR over 3 years. The businesses are also producing lots of cash currently (LAD has earned ~$40 per share the last few years) creating additional capital allocation optionality.”Much like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is a top long term stock finding favor with hedge funds.9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), often referred to as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been a part of legendary value investor Warren Buffett's portfolio for over 12 years.On May 17, Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, reaffirmed an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stock while raising the target price from $355 to $360. Silber believes that Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has the potential for a significant upside of more than 16% based on the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Founded in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational corporation recognized primarily for its production of Coca-Cola. Beyond its flagship beverage, the company engages in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse range of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) stands as one of the largest beverage corporations in the world and holds a noteworthy place among the longstanding investments of legendary value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has held a stake within the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain the company's shares.On April 26, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock’s dividend yield on June 28 came in at 3.04%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational financial services corporation that specializes in payment cards.

50,e3ba01e2-a928-3539-ba8b-08ca9de15062,QCOM,2023-07-05,Is QUALCOMM Incorporated's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporateds-nasdaq-qcom-latest-110055015.html,1688554855,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Most readers would already be aware that QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock increased significantly by 6.5% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on QUALCOMM's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:54% = US$11b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.54.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 54% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that QUALCOMM has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 49% net income growth seen by QUALCOMM over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 35%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is QCOM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether QCOM is currently mispriced by the market.Is QUALCOMM Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?QUALCOMM's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 32%, meaning the company retains 68% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and QUALCOMM is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Besides, QUALCOMM has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 34% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that QUALCOMM's future ROE will drop to 35% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with QUALCOMM's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

51,08d8d05b-4d57-3a81-9d79-596c25d540ff,QCOM,2023-07-05,7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now: June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safe-dividend-stocks-investors-110027474.html,1688036427,STORY,"['C', 'PFE', 'QCOM', 'CMI', 'HD', 'BG']","[Although the idea of acquiring the highest-yielding enterprises seems lucrative, investors right now should arguably focus on safe dividend stocks to buy. These securities often undergird consistently profitable companies that enjoy revenue predictability. Right now, predictability is more important ahead of an uncertain market environment.To be sure, the above warning doesn’t necessarily mean you’re stuck with sub-1% yielding entities. Far from it, on a relative scale, you can find high-yielding safe stocks. It’s just that when it comes to dividend investing, the idea is to play the long game. Therefore, you don’t want to just pocket some income one quarter and then watch your investment crash and burn the next.In fairness, with the benchmark equities index up double-digit percentages for the year, a conservative approach might not seem appropriate. Nevertheless, small fissures – such as rising unemployment – indicate that market participants should seek safety first. On that note, below are June 2023 dividend stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHome Depot (HD)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the most reliable businesses available, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) easily ranks among the safe dividend stocks to buy. Fundamentally, throughout inclement conditions, Home Depot stores stay open (when feasible), providing a vital service to customers in need. We all experienced that firsthand during the Covid-19 disaster, when Home Depot kept its doors open during the night hours so that people can purchase essential goods.To be fair, I wouldn’t classify it as one of the outright high-yielding safe stocks. However, the home improvement retailer more than holds its own with a forward yield of 2.66%. Also, its payout ratio comes in at 52.46%, which offers little cause for sustainability-related concerns. Also, it commands 14 years of annual dividend increases, a status management won’t want to give up cheaply.Story continuesOn the financials, Home Depot benefits from consistent profitability. As well, its trailing-year net margin stands at 10.75%, beating out 86.59% of its peers. On the top line, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) of 15.2%, beating out 76.53% of rivals. It makes a strong case for top dividend stocks to buy.Cummins (CMI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comBilled as a global power leader, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) designs, manufactures and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. Per its public profile, the company’s products range from diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid powertrains, and powertrain-related components. Thanks to its broad industrial relevancies, CMI in many ways makes for an ideal case for safe dividend stocks.While CMI hasn’t been off to a great performance in 2023, over the past one-year period, it gained over 22%. Financially, Cummins delivers on the operational front, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 9.3%, above 61.54% of rivals. Also, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 8.37%, above 67.38%.Despite the solid print, the market prices CMI at a forward multiple of only 12.36. As a discount to projected earnings, Cummins ranks better than 78.33% of companies listed in the industrial products space. For passive income, Cummins features a forward yield of 2.62%. With a payout ratio that sits at 32.13%, investors can trust the yield. Therefore, it’s one of the June 2023 dividend stocks to consider for conservative investors.Bunge (BG)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) makes an easy case for safe dividend stocks to buy. Thanks to the extraordinary pertinence of its business, demand should be both strong and predictable. According to its corporate profile, Bunge’s expansive network feeds and fuels a growing world, creating sustainable products and opportunities for more than 70,000 farmers and the consumers they serve across the globe.Still, relevancy doesn’t always translate to upside market performance. Since the January opener, BG fell more than 3%. In the trailing one-year period, it’s up less than 2%, which is absolutely not impressive. However, Bunge’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.7%, above 73.77% of sector players. It’s also consistently profitable, which is hardly a surprise.Notably, though, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.21, ranking favorably below 89.29% of its peers. If you want dividend investing at a bargain, Bunge might intrigue you. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 2.87% with a payout ratio that sits at 23.13%. For a balanced approach to the market, BG may be one of the top dividend stocks.Citigroup (C)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAn investment bank and financial services firm, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is one of the top sector players in the world. To be fair, the regional banking crisis might raise eyebrows in terms of labeling Citi as one of the safe dividend stocks. However, the ugliness in the banking space hasn’t yet reached the stalwarts.On the financials, Citigroup carries a rather mediocre profile. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 5%, which is a bit off the sector median of 6.1%. Also, it’s consistently profitable but with a trailing-year net margin of 19.52% (lower than the median 26.75%), C stock is hardly remarkable.So, why mention Citigroup in a list of safe dividend stocks? One reason is its multiple of 6.47. As a discount to earnings, the bank ranks better than nearly 68% of the competition. Also, C shares trade at a sales multiple of 1.16, well below the sector median of 2.14. Also, Citi happens to be one of the high-yielding safe stocks, offering a forward yield of 4.4%. Also, with a payout ratio sitting at 31.67%, it might attract some looks.Qualcomm (QCOM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAnother riskier idea among safe dividend stocks to buy, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a technology powerhouse might not seem appropriate to the underlying theme. However, as the world’s leading wireless tech innovator, the company is instrumental in the ongoing 5G rollout. As well, with advanced solutions such as artificial intelligence requiring greater connectivity, QCOM may be an ideal play for dividend investing.And on that front, it holds its own quite well with a forward yield of 2.67%. Since the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%, QCOM ranks among the high-yielding safe stocks on a relative basis. Also, the company commands 21 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, that’s a status that the firm’s leadership team won’t want to give up cheaply.On the financials, Qualcomm features a three-year revenue growth rate of 25%, beating out 78.37% of sector rivals. Also, its book growth rate during the same period impresses at 55.3%. Despite the stout figures, the market prices QCOM at a forward multiple of only 12.21. As a discount to projected earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 86.26% of the competition.Shell (SHEL)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a global hydrocarbon energy giant, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) might not seem immediately effective as one of the safe dividend stocks to buy. After all, the political and ideological winds consistently push the zero net emissions narrative. However, Shell and other fossil fuel giants should remain pertinent for many years (perhaps even decades) to come. Given the energy density of hydrocarbons, it’s a tough resource to just outright quit.Because of tough economic circumstances, SHEL posts a not-bad, not-great performance in the charts. Since the Jan. opener, the security gained just a hair over 7%. In the trailing one-year period, it moved up nearly 13%. Nevertheless, contrarians targeting dividend investing opportunities should give Shell another look. Specifically, the market prices SHEL at a forward multiple of 6.16. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 63.53% of the competition.Finally, Shell features a dividend yield of 3.61% along with a payout ratio of only 19.11%. If you’re seeking yield sustainability, SHEL warrants further investigation.Pfizer (PFE)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA pharmaceutical behemoth, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) gained both popularity and notoriety among some circles for its role in developing a Covid-19 vaccine. However, with both the pandemic itself and fears associated with the crisis fading away, PFE seems risky. Indeed, since the beginning of this year, PFE gave up 29% of equity value. At the same time, it may be one of the safe dividend stocks for patient investors.Almost invariably, Pfizer will leverage its acumen earned through messenger-RNA research to forward other viable therapeutics and vaccines. So, while the sharp revenue loss in the first quarter of this year is admittedly distracting, astute investors should look to what the pharma giant can do in the future.In the meantime, PFE trades at a compelling discount. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 10.93. As a discount to projected earnings, Pfizer ranks better than 75.78% of its peers. In closing, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 4.5% and a payout ratio of only 46.66%. Therefore, it’s also arguably one of the high-yielding safe stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, has awarded the deal.Valued at $66.1 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by February 2024. Per this contract, Raytheon will provide design engineering, long lead material and hardware, weapon system integration and various other support services for the F135 engine.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in East Hartford, CT.What’s Favoring Pratt &amp; Whitney?Pratt &amp; Whitney, a forerunner in manufacturing aircraft engines for military business jets, enjoys a significant order inflow. The unit has been under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin LMT.F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used in F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements.The strong demand for F-35 leverages Pratt &amp; Whitney to witness a consistent flow of orders for the F135 engine. In this context, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, signifying the parallel demand for the F135 engine that powers this stealth aircraft.Going forward, LMT anticipates F-35 delivery numbers in the band of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024. Lockheed Martin also expects to supply nearly 156 jets in 2025 and beyond.RTX is likely to have its order book full for the production of F135 engines and related support services contracts, like the latest one. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit.Story continuesPeer ProspectsThe tremendous demand that LMT’s F-35 jet enjoys tends to benefit not just RTX but one more defense major that plays a critical role in its manufacturing:Northrop Grumman NOC: The company is accountable for the production of the center fuselage of F-35, along with the design and production of AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radars and the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System and AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation and Identification avionics suite.Northrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

53,525e93fd-ec6f-357d-b54c-e5221a5f2296,LMT,2023-07-05,Blockchain to the moon! Crypto companies’ outer space plans are less silly than you think,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-moon-crypto-companies-outer-120000204.html,1688472000,STORY,['LMT'],"[In March, a crypto company announced a Bitcoin “treasure chest” hunt—in space. The firm, LunarCrush, plans to send a rover over 200,000 miles to the moon this year with a private key etched on the device. Whoever is the first to find the rover can use the private key to collect 62 Bitcoin worth around $2 million at current prices.While the celestial contest smacks of yet another crypto-related publicity stunt—others include artist Jeff Koons’s plan to put an NFT-linked sculpture on the moon—a growing number of crypto companies are treating the intersection of digital assets and space as a serious longterm business opportunity.In late June, crypto startup Cryptosat announced it is working on a “Space Wallet” designed to secure crypto in outer space. And a number of other firms, like Blockstream, SpaceChain, and Filecoin, have projects to integrate blockchains with space technology or to use space’s very remoteness to secure decentralized ledgers.Space for BlockchainYan Michalevsky, one of the cofounders of Cryptosat, says blockchain can intersect with the cosmos in two ways: “blockchain for space,” or using blockchains to enhance and improve on existing space technology, and “space for blockchain,” or using cosmic tech to improve blockchains themselves.Cryptosat falls into the latter camp. Founded by Michalevsky and Yonatan Winetraub, who are pursuing doctoral degrees at Stanford, the startup has sent two satellites the size of coffee mugs into space. Both are equipped with small computers that can perform simple computations like safeguard crypto stashes.“Given the fact that they cannot be accessed physically,” Michalevsky told Fortune, “that can protect against very sophisticated attacks that are becoming relevant, especially in the blockchain and Web3 space.”Cryptosat’s plans are a space-based twist on the crypto industry’s ongoing quest to help owners take drastic steps to secure their assets. For a layperson, the idea of using the remoteness of space to secure crypto may feel like overkill, but it could offer additional peace of mind for financial institutions or privacy-focused developers.Story continuesSpaceChain, another crypto startup cofounded by former Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, similarly has nodes, or small computers, racing through the cosmos. They have attached seven to existing satellites, and three are on the International Space Station, according to CEO Cliff Beek.“A blockchain node or any other node in space that is off the terrestrial infrastructure creates an air gap for any access that's unauthorized,” he told Fortune, noting how how difficult it would be for a hacker to access a computer racing above the Earth at approximately 17,000 miles per hour. A SpaceChain node weighs 100 grams and measures about eight inches by eight inches, according to Beek.SpaceChain has launched seven nodes, or small computers, into space so far. Courtesy of SpaceChainThen there is Blockstream, a Bitcoin-focused company founded by Adam Back, an early member of the cypherpunks who corresponded with Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, which is also making space-related investments.The company, which raised $125 million in January to expand its Bitcoin mining operations, is leasing four satellites to broadcast Bitcoin’s blockchain, or its decentralized database, across Earth.“One of the promises of Bitcoin is the ability to improve global access to remittances, finance, international transfers and things like that,” Back told Fortune. However, he said that, in some countries, the cost of a high-speed internet connection can outpace the average monthly wage, and a satellite dish is comparatively cheaper.Back’s vision is that someone can buy an old laptop, connect it to an inexpensive satellite dish, and then broadcast Bitcoin’s data locally. His hope is that “entrepreneurs and businesses in different parts of the world where bandwidth is more expensive will use this infrastructure to make it economically feasible,” he said.Currently, Blockstream’s satellites only broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain but don't update it. The firm is actively working on making its satellites able to receive data in the near future, Back told Fortune.Blockchain for SpaceSpace can potentially help secure blockchains and provide a launching ground to broadcast blockchain info, but some believe distributed ledgers can improve on existing space technology—and even secure potential communiqués from our alien neighbors.In May, the SETI Institute (short for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) announced that it had partnered with Protocol Labs, a core developer behind the Filecoin project, a decentralized database.Specifically, SETI ran a fire drill to simulate how to best respond if a satellite intercepted a transmission from extraterrestrial intelligence. An alien message would be an earth-shattering revelation, and whoever controls access to the message, SETI argues, controls one of the world’s most important collections of megabytes.Hence, the institute decided it’d be best to store the message with Filecoin, a database not under the sole control of any one authority. “They're very sensitive to not wanting to be censored and or to have anything deleted or tampered with,” Jennifer Bell, marketing lead at Protocol Labs, told Fortune.This focus on tamper proof and open data is the main value proposition for space scientists, according to Franck Marchis, senior astronomer at SETI and chief science officer at telescope startup Unistellar.“I believe that space is going to be the next big thing, and if we want to have young, smart, motivated people to work in space, we need to train them and we need to give them access now to the data,” he told Fortune.And beyond aliens, defense contractor Lockheed Martin is also looking to Filecoin to secure inter-satellite communications. Satellites often relay data between each other, but in the highly nationalistic and competitive arena of the cosmos, trust in the integrity of a message relayed over a satellite grid is difficult to maintain.To this end, Lockheed plans to launch IPFS—short for interplanetary file system—nodes into the heavens to test out the feasibility of using blockchain technology to secure satellite transmissions with the help of Filecoin affiliate Protocol Labs. (IPFS is the protocol that underlies the Filecoin project.)“The U.S. and its allies are investing very heavily and very legitimately in lunar and interplanetary travel, and IPFS—it has interplanetary in its name—was designed for this use case from day one,” Anshuman Prasad, partnerships lead at Protocol Labs, told Fortune.Launch sequenceThe firms Fortune spoke to have already carved out space in outer space for crypto and, despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty, are planning more launches this year.Lockheed is readying its LM 400 Technology Demonstrator spacecraft for launch in 2023, and aboard will be IPFS nodes, according to the Filecoin Foundation. Cryptosats is looking to shoot its third satellite into the cosmos by the end of 2023, and SpaceChain is also looking to send a node into space during a similar timeframe. “We try to do one launch a year,” its CEO Beek told Fortune.The number of companies experimenting with blockchain in space are small but persistent and, while crypto may not be able to escape the withering eye of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it can escape Earth’s gravity just fine.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $795.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 30, 2027.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Apart from manufacturing missiles as well as space and tanker aircraft, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of defense aircraft and jet components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

This company, which is in the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this homebuilder has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 29.03%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, PulteGroup came out with earnings of $2.35 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 per share, representing a surprise of 32.02%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.88 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.63 per share, delivering a surprise of 26.04%.For PulteGroup, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PulteGroup has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 25, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

57,4b9dcacc-89bd-3ba3-937e-c829bd065f55,JNJ,2023-07-05,15 Best Places to Retire in the Caribbean,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-places-retire-caribbean-223717881.html,1688510237,STORY,"['HD', 'PG', 'JNJ']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best places to retire in the Caribbean. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on a million-dollar retirement, and retiring in the Caribbean, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in the Caribbean.A Million Dollar RetirementPreviously, a comfortable retirement in the USA cost an estimated $1 million. However, a million dollars may be insufficient for the retiree today. Julian B. Morris, CFP at Concierge Wealth Management, notes,“$1 million likely isn’t enough for retirement anymore because the cost of living has continued to rise from previous generations.”Human beings are also living longer, Morris notes. Due to this reason, it is quite difficult that the amount will cover healthcare expenses for a longer period of time. Adding to the challenges, social security is projected to be depleted by 2033, further exacerbating the financial concerns of retirees.Northwestern Mutual's 2023 Planning &amp; Progress Study has updated the $1 million forecast, specifying that Americans now require a minimum of $1.27 million to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Working for decades amidst the rising inflation, every potential retiree needs passive income and peace of mind. Nest eggs work as a support system in this regard, complementing social security benefits to help retirees manage expenses throughout their retirement years.Apart from nest eggs, dividends can also act as a strong retirement foundation, notes the Motley Fool. Some stocks to add to your early retirement portfolio include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD). Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a healthcare conglomerate selling medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs. The legendary dividend payer has a manageable dividend payout ratio at 73%.Similarly, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is the king of household staples. Boasting one of the longest dividend growth streaks of Wall Street, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) is offering a solid dividend yield of 2.5% that retirees can gain an advantage out of. Finally, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) operates in a multimillion-dollar industry, increasing its dividends over the last 14 years. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) also boasts a dividend payout ratio of 60% and a solid 2.8% yield.Story continuesApart from these stocks, healthcare stocks can also be beneficial to invest in. One study notes that, on average, healthcare stocks are 23% less volatile than other stocks. Some best healthcare stocks to buy include Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Retiring in the CaribbeanPotential retirees aren’t able to save for their retirement years, with lack of financial knowledge being a major cause. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that 40% of workers don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, adding to the challenge. As such, many retirees choose to relocate to different areas within the States, as well as around the world, that can help them stretch their retirement savings.Some of the best places to retire in the world on social security include Chitré, Panama; Georgetown, Malaysia; Madrid, Spain; and Abruzzo, Italy. While these places help retirees stretch their dollar incomes further, many potential retirees would skip them to live on an island instead. Fun, adventure, and beaches are the top reasons retirees love to live on an island.As such, the best islands to move and start over include Malta; Mallorca; Spain, Penang, Malaysia; and Ambergris Caye, Belize; to name a few. For those who wish to stay within the States, some of the best U.S. islands to retire to include Hilton Head Island and Kiawah Island in South Carolina, Maui and Oahu in Hawaii, and Amelia Island in Florida.Another favorite hotspot amongst retirees is the Caribbean. Lower cost of living, established expat communities, rich culture, retirement-friendly policies, and plentiful chances at recreation are some of the reasons retirees wish to move here. Retirees especially love Dominica, as it is one of the best Caribbean islands to retire cheaply. Many individuals also choose to retire early and elope to the islands. With the right retirement strategies, many individuals have been able to move to the Caribbean as early as 39 and 40, reports CNBC. For such couples looking to retire early, Jamaica can be the best Caribbean island to live with a family.Topping all of these locations is Montserrat. Retirepedia deems Montserrat as the safest place to retire in the Caribbean. The British territory is located in the Leeward Islands, offering coral reefs, black sand beaches, and exciting seaside caves. If all of this excites you to consider retiring to the Caribbean, we have drafted an entire list of the best places you can retire to.15 Best Places to Retire in the CaribbeanMethodologyIn order to compile the list of the top places to retire in the Caribbean, we have used a scoring system based on the number of times each place appeared on a source. For this reason, we have used a total of 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources. Each place got 2 points every time it appeared on our list of sources.The scores were totaled, and places were ranked from the lowest to the highest scores. For places with the same scores, tie-breaking was done based on the cost of living. Out of two places with the same scores, those with a lower cost of living were awarded 0.1 points. Similarly, three places with the same scores were awarded 0.2 points for the least cost of living, 0.1 points for the second lowest cost of living, and so on.Note: Even though Honduras and Belize are not technically part of the Caribbean, we've added them in our list because they share similar characteristics with other Caribbean countries.Here are the best countries to retire in the Caribbean:15.

Puerto RicoInsider Monkey Score: 4.1Puerto Rico is a retirement haven on many retirees' wish lists. It is famous for its tropical climate and sunny beaches, offering retirees an appealing escape from the colder climates.

Most importantly, the cost of living is extremely affordable. Living Cost.org notes that monthly living expenses are $1,617 for an individual living in Puerto Rico.11.

According to Livingcost.org, an individual's living cost is a monthly $1,320 in Curaçao.9. GrenadaInsider Monkey Score: 4.4Another appealing retirement destination in the Caribbean is Grenada. The island country is located in the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea. The country's major draws are the warm climate, friendly locals, and beautiful natural scenery.

For more stocks on this list, head on over to Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks for 20 Years.The world of investments is not for those that are prone to panicking easily. Over a few years, stocks previously believed to be impervious to typical market downturns have experienced significant declines, only to rebound briefly before facing further declines. At the center of this whirlwind, lies the Federal Reserve’s primary policy tool: interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to slow the amount of money circulating through the economy and drive down aggregate demand. With higher interest rates, there should be lower demand for goods and services, and the prices for those goods and services should fall as a consequence. Of course, the Federal Reserve doesn't always increase its interest rates in a linear fashion. Following a streak of 10 consecutive meetings where rates were increased, occasionally by as much as three-quarters of a point per meeting, the Fed decided to forgo the June gathering. In this environment, investors are currently anticipating a resumption of rate hikes in July, with the possibility of the Fed assessing the need for additional increases during alternate sessions, a pace that has been observed in previous periods of tightening.The discussion around a potential economic recession has resurfaced with the participation of another Federal Reserve official in the debate over future interest rate increases. Mary Daly, the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, expressed in an exclusive interview with Reuters that there is a genuine possibility of two additional interest rate hikes occurring within the remainder of this year. In contrast to the previous year, where the risk of uncontrollable inflation outweighed the risk of excessively slowing down the economy, the current situation presents a shift in risks. Now, the risks lie in the potential consequences of taking too little action on interest rates compared to the risks associated with taking too many measures. According to Daly, her community advisory council and other business contacts have consistently expressed their concerns regarding two major issues: persistently high inflation and ongoing labor shortages. The personal consumption expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 4.4%. Although this is a decline from the peak of 7% observed last summer, it still remains more than double the Fed's target of 2%. Additionally, the unemployment rate has slightly increased to 3.7%, which remains lower than the 4% rate estimated by Fed policymakersStory continuesLong-term investment in the stock market is arguably the most reliable method to grow your wealth. Long-term investors disregard the volatile fluctuations of stock markets that occur in the short term. Instead of being entangled in the theatrics, they choose to invest in the stocks of established companies known for their consistent and enduring performance, spanning years, or perhaps even decades. By adopting this approach, investors can shield their investments from temporary headwinds, such as the ones witnessed during the economic downturn of the previous year. As an example, the Nasdaq Composite index experienced a steep decline of 33% in 2022. Nevertheless, due to the alleviation of inflationary pressures, the index has surged by 29.9% year-to-date, resulting in a remarkable 79.65% growth over the past five years, despite recent adversities. As a consequence, investors who withdrew their investments during the market lows of 2022 will miss out on the gradual rebound witnessed this year.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some great stocks for a long term portfolio, out of which the top picks include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). If you wish to see more stocks that possess long term potential, you can check out our article on the 15 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts.Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 20 YearsOur MethodologyIn order to compile our selection of top long-term stocks, we began by analyzing the stock portfolios of several prominent long-term investors, including value investor David Abrams, Baupost Group's Seth Klarman, and Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. We then chose the stock holdings that have remained within some of their portfolios for 5 years or more. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey's survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is an American nationwide automotive dealership group headquartered in Medford, Oregon. The third largest new vehicle automotive dealership group in the United States, the company offers a diverse array of services that encompass the purchase of both new and pre-owned vehicles, various vehicle financing alternatives, warranties, insurance plans, theft protection services, as well as comprehensive automotive repair and maintenance solutions. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) has been part of value investor David Abrams portfolio since Q2 2018, signifying his trust in the stock's long-term viability.On April 19, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend, a 19% increase from its prior dividend of $0.42. The dividend was paid on May 26, to shareholders of record on May 12.As of the March quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared with 40 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $1.7 billion.Right Tail Capital mentioned Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The original research premise fit right into Right Tail’s wheelhouse: a set of good businesses trading at attractive long-term valuations. Valuations look inexpensive at mid to high single digit multiples of earnings. Historically, these businesses have traded at 10-15x P/E multiples despite having more leverage and holding more inventory than they do today. In some ways, the historical multiples feel appropriate given their delicate relationships with manufacturers and cyclicality; on the other hand, these businesses have produced solid mid-teens returns with attractive reinvestment opportunities suggesting they are better than average companies. Adding another wrinkle to the puzzle, these businesses have over-earned the last few years due to Covid (car shortages, consumers flush with cash, etc.).As I began the work, the compelling return potential warranted additional research. Lithia Motors (LAD), for example, has laid out a 2025 earnings per share target of $55-60. If the company reaches $55 in earnings and trades at a 12x P/E, we’d have a stock price of $660 – this would be a triple from today’s prices and produce a ~45% IRR over 3 years. The businesses are also producing lots of cash currently (LAD has earned ~$40 per share the last few years) creating additional capital allocation optionality.”Much like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is a top long term stock finding favor with hedge funds.9.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7.

That means we need to increase the span of the wing,"" Partridge said.Partridge declined to say when Airbus would choose between dozens of technologies it is testing but said it would be ready for any business decision on a new programme. Analysts say work on a 2035 model would have to be launched by 2027-28.Asked if new technology could be used to upgrade existing models like the A321, Partridge said ""yes, theoretically"".Industry sources say Airbus could tap part of the research if it moves ahead with a potential stretch of the smaller A220.Airbus has not said what the plane, known internally as ""A220 Stretch,"" would involve but sources say one scenario calls for new wings and engines for entry to service not before 2030.(Reporting by Joanna Plucinska in Filton and Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $795.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 30, 2027.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Apart from manufacturing missiles as well as space and tanker aircraft, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of defense aircraft and jet components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, has awarded the deal.Valued at $66.1 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by February 2024. Per this contract, Raytheon will provide design engineering, long lead material and hardware, weapon system integration and various other support services for the F135 engine.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in East Hartford, CT.What’s Favoring Pratt &amp; Whitney?Pratt &amp; Whitney, a forerunner in manufacturing aircraft engines for military business jets, enjoys a significant order inflow. The unit has been under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin LMT.F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used in F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements.The strong demand for F-35 leverages Pratt &amp; Whitney to witness a consistent flow of orders for the F135 engine. In this context, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, signifying the parallel demand for the F135 engine that powers this stealth aircraft.Going forward, LMT anticipates F-35 delivery numbers in the band of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024. Lockheed Martin also expects to supply nearly 156 jets in 2025 and beyond.RTX is likely to have its order book full for the production of F135 engines and related support services contracts, like the latest one. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit.Story continuesPeer ProspectsThe tremendous demand that LMT’s F-35 jet enjoys tends to benefit not just RTX but one more defense major that plays a critical role in its manufacturing:Northrop Grumman NOC: The company is accountable for the production of the center fuselage of F-35, along with the design and production of AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radars and the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System and AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation and Identification avionics suite.Northrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

Apart from manufacturing missiles as well as space and tanker aircraft, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of defense aircraft and jet components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head directly to the 10 Cities With Highest Percentage of African American Population.A report in the Brookings Institution in 2019 highlighted that although the share of African Americans in the population has only grown 1.5% since 1970, internal migration of the community has led to the rise of what is known as ‘black-majority cities’. More African Americans are moving to cities that have a black majority in their quest for opportunity and sustainability.The Census Bureau has projected the United States to become a minority white country by 2045, with current racial minorities, which include African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, becoming the primary drivers of the nation’s economy. This shift in population is expected for two reasons. First, the number of combined racial minorities is expected to grow by 74% between 2018 and 2060, and secondly, the ageing white population will likely see a decline over the same period.Jackson, Mississippi has the highest percentage of African Americans among cities in the United States, accounting for more than 80% of the city’s population. It is often referred to as the blackest city in America. As far as states are concerned, in terms of numbers, Texas has the highest population of African Americans with 3.55 million people, followed by Georgia at second, and Florida being third. These are the top three black states in the country.The African American community has produced some of the most prominent people in the United States like Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and Oprah Winfrey, among others. They are known world over due to their accomplishments. Tiger Woods is an American professional golfer who is widely regarded as one of the world’s famous athletes for his PGA Tour wins. Woods has received endorsement from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) for a number of years, starting first in 1996. At one point, it seemed as if NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Tiger Woods were synonymous due to the long partnership they have had over the years.Story continuesMichael Jordan is one of the richest African Americans, having a net worth of $2 billion. He is regarded as the greatest NBA player of all time. Jordan now owns shares in NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s Jordan brand, and receives a share of income from every NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) Jordan sold. You can read more on this in our article, Michael Jordan, 10 Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks. TV talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, is one of the richest self-made women in the US. Born in Kosciusko, northeast of Jackson, she boasts a net worth of $2.5 billion, and has investments in WW International, Inc. (NASDAQ:WW) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).According to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) of the U.S. Senate, there are more than 3 million businesses owned by African Americans, which contribute about $200 billion to the national economy and provide employment to over 1 million Americans. Between 2012 and 2017, businesses owned by African Americans grew at a faster rate than those that were white-owned. The JEC declared that the future and prosperity of the economy is linked to fighting racism and ensuring equal opportunity for all racial groups in the U.S.Worldwide Technology Company is the biggest company in the US owned by an African American. The technology solutions provider was estimated to have generated over $11 billion in revenue in 2021. It provides supply chain solutions to nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies. Worldwide Technology Company is followed by ActOne Group on the second spot.

This is because there is a significant difference between how the Fed and the company’s risk management predicts BofA to fare in case of a severe recession.Per BofA’s analysis, it will lose $52 billion in case of a severe economic downturn and its capital ratio will decline to a minimum of 8.3% per cent. However, per the Fed’s stress test results, BofA will lose only $23 billion in a severe economic downturn and its capital ratio will fall to 10.6%.Hence, BofA has initiated a dialogue with the Fed to understand the difference that arose in other comprehensive income over the nine-quarter stress period between the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review results and BAC’s Dodd-Frank Act stress test results.Over the past six months, shares of BAC have lost 14.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 7.4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, BAC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The results of the 2023 stress test, which were announced last week, indicate that banks have sufficient capital to withstand a severe economic downturn.This year’s annual health check has solidified the notion that large banks are resilient. Results have shown that the 23 participating banks have enough capital to absorb the $541 billion in projected losses on loans and other positions.Going into the stress test, analysts were forecasting conservative payouts from banks on the back of potential stringent regulatory capital requirements and ambiguity over the macroeconomic backdrop, including probable recession next year.However, now, after the results have come out pretty well, banks are expected to be subjected to smaller stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirements, which have opened the doors for bigger-than-expected payouts.Thus, some of the large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan JPM and Wells Fargo WFC, said on Friday that they would return more cash to shareholders.JPM, the largest U.S. bank, intends to raise the quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share. This follows no change in dividend payout last year.The company’s chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, said, “We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet with strong capital levels and robust liquidity, and we remain prepared for a broad range of potential outcomes, including potentially higher future capital requirements from the finalization of the Basel III capital rules.”JPM also plans to continue with its previously announced share repurchase program.Likewise, Wells Fargo announced plans to hike its dividend to 35 cents per share from the current 30 cents. Also, over the four-quarter period through the second quarter of 2024, WFC has the capacity to repurchase shares.While Citigroup C announced a dividend hike of 4% to 53 cents per share, it, too, was disappointed with the results of its stress test. For Citigroup, the Fed predicts its capital ratio to fall to 9.1% in case of a severe economic downturn, while the company’s estimate is 10.6%.Thus, Citigroup has also sought information from the Fed on its test result.Moreover, Citigroup is the only large bank whose SCB requirement will increase to 4.3% from 4% following this year’s stress test.Story continuesConclusionThe stress test results and the subsequent increases in payouts by banks show that the industry is well-prepared to confront any challenges.Yet, banks continue to brace for higher capital requirements from the regulators. This is a major near-term headwind and seems to have held back regional banks from coming up with new capital plans.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is aiming to be the third vaccine maker to get an approval in the country after GSK and Pfizer Inc.Moderna has also submitted applications to the European, Swiss and Australian regulators, the company said.Its RSV vaccine is one of the key products in Moderna's pipeline that is expected to help revive sales for the company next year as it transitions from a possible net loss this year.Moderna's shot, which it is aiming to launch in the United States in 2024, was found to be 82.4% effective against RSV lower respiratory tract disease with three or more symptoms in older adults in a late-stage trial.GSK and Pfizer are expected to launch their vaccines this fall season.The efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine fell to 78.6% through the middle of a second RSV season from 88.9% at the end of the first season in older adults, while that of GSK's shot fell to 84.6% from about 94% at the end of first.At a meeting of advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GSK said it expects to price its shot between $200 and $295 a dose.Meanwhile, Pfizer provided the CDC with a price range of $180 to $270 per dose, but would not guarantee that its final price would fall within that range, saying it was in the middle of competitive price negotiations on the shots.(Reporting by Leroy Leo in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

Some of them really do deliver, though, and even significant dollars if you use them frequently.Tip: Don’t Buy Groceries on These Days of the WeekMore: How To Get Money Back on Your Everyday PurchasesMany of these apps require you to shop at specific stores or retailers, online and in-person, while others will aggregate coupons for you according to places you like to shop. Whichever you prefer, there’s certainly a cash-back app out there for you that can help boost your bank account — and all you have to do is shop.UpsideUpside is an app that allows you to earn cash back at over 50,000 businesses in three categories: gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants. GOBankingRates previously reported that the average offer is around 11 cents back per gallon of gas, 7% cash back on groceries and 10% on restaurants (dining in or direct ordering, not through third-party delivery services).However, offers differ between participating businesses and can be much higher — up to 45% at restaurants, 30% on groceries and 25 cents per gallon of gas. Overall though, you should expect to see offers closer to the average.Any cash back you earn can be transferred directly into your bank account, PayPal account or put on a gift card to retailers like Amazon or Starbucks. If you use your app frequently, you may be able to earn several hundred dollars per year. Better yet, you can also double dip — meaning you still earn cash back with Upside even if you’re using a credit card or rewards card that offers cash back as well.I’m a Financial Planning Expert: 6 Worst Purchases To Make in an Economic DownturnIbottaIbotta is among the first and best known cash-back apps (it’s also a browser extension).

You do need to be careful to add your offers to your list, however, or you won’t get the deals when you shop.RetailMeNotRetailMeNot primarily helps users find coupons that can get them discounts on stores and products that are personalized to their needs and tastes. Users will receive up to 10% cash back on any order, but then they can also find specific deals for a wide variety of retailers that vary widely in the amount of cash back. Earnings are paid out via PayPal or Venmo.RakutenRakuten also works as both an app and a browser extension for your computer, so you can take advantage of deals no matter how you shop. With Rakuten, you will only be able to earn cash back on retailers that are part of their network, which they state is about 3,500 stores, but it does qualify for both online and in-store types of purchases. Additionally, if you install the browser extension, you’ll receive notifications about cash-back opportunities.Your earnings will only be paid out once you earn $10, and only quarterly through PayPal or via a physical check that can be mailed to your address.

Marathon Petroleum (MPC), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This refiner has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 13.07%.For the last reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum came out with earnings of $6.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 per share, representing a surprise of 6.10%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.54 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.65 per share, delivering a surprise of 20.04%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Marathon Petroleum lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marathon Petroleum currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.35%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 1, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

84,86511b19-aab0-369d-b413-cb7598ea6352,MPC,2023-07-05,7 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy if You’re a Young Investor,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-high-growth-stocks-110033421.html,1688036433,STORY,"['WCC', 'HRMY', 'FMX', 'CAR', 'MPC']","[Generally speaking, financial advisors will often direct you to reliable enterprises though, for certain folks, high-growth stocks may make more sense. That’s particularly true if you’re part of the younger crowd. Here, with time as an advantage, growth investing becomes quite intriguing.Indeed, to achieve a robust retirement, carefully researched high-growth stocks for young investors may actually play a pivotal role. Frankly, if you take too many conservative bets, you’re probably denying yourself significant upside opportunities. Even under the framework of long-term investing, some risk may be necessary to maximize your potential.Also, you’re only young once which means that for stocks for millennials, it’s critical to target at least some compelling (albeit higher-risk) ideas. Basically, once you start getting close to retirement age, you really shouldn’t be messing around with high-risk, high-growth enterprises. With that in mind, below are some ideas to consider if you’re just starting out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFemsa (FMX)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockA Mexican multinational beverage and retail company, Femsa (NYSE:FMX) operates the largest independent Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottling group in the world. As well, it owns the largest convenience store chain in its home nation. Shares have already accelerated to an over 42% return since the beginning of Jan. However, for patient investors of high-growth stocks, FMX could be very enticing.Of course, we wouldn’t be talking about stocks for young investors without discussing the underlying top-line expansion. Per Gurufocus, Femsa carries a three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) of 53.7%, blowing past nearly 96% of the field. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period clocks in at 50.3%, above 95.53% of rivals.Almost as a bonus, the market prices FMX at a sales multiple of 1.17, below the sector median of 1.75. To be fair, analysts only see FMX hitting $113.40, which represents 2.4% upside. However, the underlying expansion and relevancy toward a key growth market make it one of the growth investing stocks for millennials.Story continuesAvis Budget (CAR)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockJust a cursory look at Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR) demonstrates that it’s one of the top high-growth stocks for young investors. Since the Jan. opener, CAR gained over 36% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it swung up nearly 45%. Fundamentally, the revenge travel phenomenon continues to be relevant this year. It’s also possible that folks are enjoying one last hurrah before a recession.Whatever the case, the cabin fever and pent-up demand framework have been an absolute beauty for Avis. Notably, the rental car agency printed a three-year revenue growth rate of 30%, above nearly 92% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth during the same period clocked in at 42.7%, outpacing 86.55% of its rivals. Interestingly, AVIS happens to not only be one of the opportunities for long-term investing, but it’s also deeply undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.26, below 93.88% of the competition.While analysts only forecast shares hitting $238.25 (implying 6% upside), a robust travel season could make AVIS a great idea for growth investing.Wesco (WCC)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockWhile Wesco (NYSE:WCC) doesn’t exactly make an immediate case for high-growth stocks for young investors, it’s worth extra consideration. Per its corporate profile, Wesco is a leading provider of business-to-business distribution, logistics services, and supply chain management solutions. If I’m being honest, it’s quite boring. However, WCC also skyrocketed just over 39% since the Jan. opener.In the past one-year period, WCC gained over 57%, a sterling performance. On the financials, the hits just keep coming. Per Gurufocus, Wesco’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 28.6%, outflanking 91.1% of its rivals. Also, during the same period, its EBITDA growth hit 48.7%, ranking above 90.84%.Despite these blistering stats, the market prices WCC at a forward multiple of only 10. As a discount to projected earnings, Wesco ranks better than 77.78% of the competition. Also, the big one: analysts peg WCC as a unanimous strong buy. With a high price target implying over 21% upside, WCC ranks among the stocks for millennials.Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comAmong the high-growth stocks for young investors that really sells itself, Brookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC) operates one of the world’s largest publicly traded platforms for renewable power and decarbonization solutions. Per its website, Brookfield’s diversified portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar distributed energy, and sustainable solutions across five continents.Thanks to the broader political push for go-green innovations, BEPC ranks among the most relevant ideas for growth investing. Further, the financials demonstrate that Brookfield is in expansion mode. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 29%, above just over 80% of its peers. During the same frame, its EBITDA growth rate clocks in at 57.6%, above nearly 90%.Notably, BEPC trades at 3.37 times operating cash flow, ranking better than 73.9% of sector players. It also trades with a low earnings multiple of 3.89. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg BEPC as a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $39, implying over 22% upside potential.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockWhile I just got done stating that the political winds favor renewable energy solutions, I don’t believe for a second that hydrocarbons will just disappear. Therefore, I believe Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) deserves consideration as one of the high-growth stocks for young investors. Essentially, the energy density of fossil fuels is simply too great for industry to ignore.To be sure, MPC isn’t all that impressive on a year-to-date basis. However, over the past 365 days, shares gained almost 29% of equity value. On the financials, Marathon features a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%, boxing out 80.3% of rivals. During the same period, Marathon’s EBITDA growth rate hit 60.9%, outpacing 88.21%.Notably, the consistently profitable Marathon also represents an undervalued proposition. Specifically, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 6.09, below the sector median of 7.51 times. Looking to the Street, analysts peg MPC as a moderate buy with a $140.13 average price target (implying 23% upside). Thus, it’s a solid idea for long-term investing.JOYY (YY)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA global social media platform, JOYY (NASDAQ:YY) is both an enticing idea for high-growth stocks for young investors as well as a terribly risky proposition. Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: the social media space is overcrowded. Therefore, it’s not particularly surprising that since the Jan. opener, YY slipped more than 12%. In the trailing year, it’s gone nowhere.On the other hand, Joyy enables users to interact with each other in real-time through online live media and offers users a uniquely engaging and immersive entertainment experience, per its corporate profile. It just might be enough to distinguish itself from the competition. One thing’s for sure. With a three-year revenue growth rate of 36%, it’s putting a beatdown on nearly 84% of its peers.Also, despite the top-line expansion, YY trades at a sales multiple of 1.03. As a discount to revenue, Joyy ranks better than 74% of companies in the interactive media space. Lastly, analysts peg YY as a moderate buy with a $41.67 price target (implying over 35% upside potential).Harmony Biosciences (HRMY)Wooded cube block on yellow background with word GROWTH.Source: ShutterstockIf you have some loose change lying around, you may want to consider throwing some to Harmony Biosciences (NASDAQ:HRMY). By loose change, I do mean exactly that. Since the beginning of this year, HRMY gave up over 34% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it’s down 31%. I appreciate the science, which focuses on research, drug development, and treatment for neurologic disorders of sleep-wake state instability.Still, I want to emphasize the speculative nature of HRMY; it’s just not for the faint of heart. That said, Harmony legitimately ranks among the high-growth stocks for young investors. For example, in the first quarter of 2023, the biotech company posted $119.1 million in sales, up nearly 40% against the year-ago quarter. Also, since 2019, Harmony posted scorching expansion stats.Even more attractive, the market prices HRMY at a forward multiple of 15.67. As a discount to projected earnings, Harmony ranks better than 74.55% of the competition. On a final note, analysts peg HRMY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $61.43, implying over 76% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head directly to the 10 Cities With Highest Percentage of African American Population.A report in the Brookings Institution in 2019 highlighted that although the share of African Americans in the population has only grown 1.5% since 1970, internal migration of the community has led to the rise of what is known as ‘black-majority cities’. More African Americans are moving to cities that have a black majority in their quest for opportunity and sustainability.The Census Bureau has projected the United States to become a minority white country by 2045, with current racial minorities, which include African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, becoming the primary drivers of the nation’s economy. This shift in population is expected for two reasons. First, the number of combined racial minorities is expected to grow by 74% between 2018 and 2060, and secondly, the ageing white population will likely see a decline over the same period.Jackson, Mississippi has the highest percentage of African Americans among cities in the United States, accounting for more than 80% of the city’s population. It is often referred to as the blackest city in America. As far as states are concerned, in terms of numbers, Texas has the highest population of African Americans with 3.55 million people, followed by Georgia at second, and Florida being third. These are the top three black states in the country.The African American community has produced some of the most prominent people in the United States like Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and Oprah Winfrey, among others. They are known world over due to their accomplishments. Tiger Woods is an American professional golfer who is widely regarded as one of the world’s famous athletes for his PGA Tour wins. Woods has received endorsement from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) for a number of years, starting first in 1996. At one point, it seemed as if NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Tiger Woods were synonymous due to the long partnership they have had over the years.Story continuesMichael Jordan is one of the richest African Americans, having a net worth of $2 billion. He is regarded as the greatest NBA player of all time. Jordan now owns shares in NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s Jordan brand, and receives a share of income from every NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) Jordan sold. You can read more on this in our article, Michael Jordan, 10 Richest Black Americans and Their Stock Picks. TV talk show host, Oprah Winfrey, is one of the richest self-made women in the US. Born in Kosciusko, northeast of Jackson, she boasts a net worth of $2.5 billion, and has investments in WW International, Inc. (NASDAQ:WW) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

General Motors Company (GM), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 30.47%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, General Motors Company came out with earnings of $2.21 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 per share, representing a surprise of 34.76%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.68 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.12 per share, delivering a surprise of 26.19%.For General Motors Company, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.

When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

PNC has announced that it expects its Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), effective from Oct 1, 2023, to decrease to 2.5% from 2.9%.With a lower SCB, a company typically has higher flexibility to deploy capital in share buybacks and dividends. Accordingly, PNC announced a hike in its quarterly dividend. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.55 per share, marking an increase of 3.3% from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid out on Aug 5 to shareholders of record on Jul 17.PNC’s chief executive officer William S. Demchak stated, ""The increase in our dividend reflects the continued strength of our capital and liquidity levels, and our board's confidence in our strategy and outlook.""Prior to this, PNC Financial hiked its dividend by 20% to $1.5 per share in April 2022.Considering the last day’s closing price of $127.53, PNC’s dividend yield currently stands at 4.86%. The yield is significantly impressive compared with the industry average of 4.43%. The yield, representing a steady income stream, attracts investors.This aside, PNC announced a 100 million common stock repurchase program in the second quarter of 2022. In first-quarter 2023, 2.4 million shares were repurchased for $0.4 billion, with 47% of the total authorization remaining under the plan. Apart from reflecting the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders such efforts indicate its healthy position to endure severe economic downturns.However, given the likelihood of stringent regulatory capital requirements and ambiguity over the macroeconomic backdrop, including probable recession next year, PNC is expected to reduce its share repurchase activity in the third quarter of 2023 compared with the prior quarters.Over the past six months, shares of PNC have lost 22.2% compared with a fall of 8.1% of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continues PNC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

So, the Eternal City was the perfect fit for the opening of the latest EDITION.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230705332823/en/The Lobby at The Rome EDITION (Photo: Business Wire)Conceived, concepted, and programmed by the visionary entrepreneur, Ian Schrager, executed and interpreted by the hotel owners, Statuto Group, the intimate 91-room Rome EDITION sets a new standard in the Eternal City. Its sophistication, attention to detail, refinement, and high design aesthetic make it set to become a meeting place for Romans and travellers alike. Positioned in one of the most enviable areas of Rome, the hotel is only a few short steps from Via Veneto, the most sought-after street in all of Italy.

Not only that – all the major attractions are within easy reach, including the Piazza Barberini, the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the ever-beautiful Borghese Gardens.Built in the 1940s and formerly occupied by one of the main Italian banks, the building is a striking example of the rationalist style and was created by Cesare Pascoletti in collaboration with the famed architect Marcello Piacentini. The stunning central staircase of rare cipollino marble from the quarries of Apuane is testament to their genius. Original features are retained throughout, including the central courtyards and original statues and lamps.The hotel has three unique bars, a rooftop lounge, bar and pool, a show-kitchen restaurant, a well-appointed urban wellness space with gym and treatment rooms, and a courtyard garden where guests can while away the time sipping their favourite drink or sampling the peerless food menu from adored Roman Chef Paola Colucci, the hotel’s chef partner. The 91 rooms, including 17 suites, have all the design elements the brand is renowned for: the muted tones, the accents of walnut wood and stunning custom designed furniture.Story continuesRome is a city obsessed with its food, so EDITION took great care in choosing a chef that embodies the city to lead its food offerings. And they found her in Paola Colucci, the self-taught founder of Roman favourite restaurant Pianostrada. Colucci came to cooking later in life, after spending 20 years in finance she left the industry to fulfil her lifelong passion of cooking and opened her first restaurant nine years ago. Alongside her best friend and business partner, Chiara Magliocchetti, Colucci’s two daughters, Alice and Flaminia Spognetta, make up the female-led team.Known as one of the best and most intuitive chefs in the city, she is a firm believer in the emotionality of food and the importance of interacting with her guests. It is for that reason that her kitchen at The Rome EDITION’s signature restaurant Anima will be open-fronted and screened with ambered glass, so all can admire her work. Using recipes passed down through the generations of her family, the menu includes traditional Italian dishes with a modern twist and international outlook.The focus at The Rome EDITION will be seasonality and freshness. Guests can expect show-stopping flavours in dishes at Anima including Chef Colucci’s version of spaghetti with roasted tomatoes and veal with tuna sauce, alongside some of the best tomato and burrata in all of Italy. There will be a heavy emphasis on Italian wines, though other countries will of course be represented too, with a list that is primarily driven by emotion and has a heavy focus on food pairings. The light-filled restaurant with chartreuse and blue upholstered furniture will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.In a first for the city, the hotel has an expansive lush garden that will be both piazza and dining space. It is here in the private garden that guests begin their journey as the hotel unfolds like acts in an opera. A Roman street scape leading into the heart of the hotel, it is an indoor-outdoor space, a jungle abundant with more than 400 plants and a cascade of climbing Jasmine over the façade. A dramatic bronze metal awning overlooks teak wood banquettes and free-standing furniture along with an Italianate arrangement of lanterns to give it the feel of a traditional Roman garden. The Garden provides outdoor seating for Anima one side and a relaxed all-day terrace on the other, offering a menu of light dishes available throughout the day until late evening. Featuring old favourites and new creations the menu is accompanied by a modernist cocktail list inspired by Italian gardens and the Mediterranean.As with all EDITION hotels, the social heart of the hotel, The Lobby, sets the tone. With dramatic 22ft-high (7m) ceilings, and porous travertine floors and walls it is a show-stopping space for Romans and travellers alike. Two symmetrical seating arrangements are the central axis of the space. White custom fabric sofas and coffee tables inspired by Manuel Coltri lie next to petrified wood side tables and standing lamps. The Lobby is EDITION at its most dynamic. It is a place to relax and make merry; a place to see and be seen or play a few games of pool on the custom-made table.Located on the ground floor, two unique bars set the benchmark for mixology in the city: Punch Room and Jade Bar. The Punch Room, EDITION’s signature bar concept, is an award-winning speakeasy-inspired bar concept that follows the standard set at other EDITION properties worldwide. Born in the 17th century, traditional punches utilised the exciting new ingredients discovered on the trade routes, the five traditional ingredients of punch highlighted spirits from Europe and the colonies, spices and citrus from Africa and the east, teas from China and India, and sugar from the Indies. Taking inspiration from traditional recipes, Punch Room puts a modern spin on the drink. The dark walnut wood bar, with its Rosso Levanto marble fireplace and custom armchairs in rosewood and dark brown leather, is a place where guests can unwind with friends under low lights. The perfect spot to recline on the amaranth-coloured velvet sofas and explore Punch cocktails that examine the influence of the Roman Empire, it is a convivial and relaxed space.Jade Bar is an intimate mixology destination, designed to attract true connoisseurs and aficionados. Advanced techniques create a kaleidoscope of cocktails from a limited range of spirits and seasonal ingredients, effectively creating a gallery of flavour which changes throughout the year. The elevated experience of Jade Bar is an ode to the Roman passion for honouring the finest of nature’s offerings. The intimate jewel box-like space has floor-to-ceiling green antique marble picked out with accents of satin brass and gold. Guests are encouraged to relax on the emerald velvet banquettes and take in the Jeff Koons-inspired sculptural pieces, while enjoying the unique offering.Located on the seventh floor, The Roof offers unobstructed views across the city skyline and landmarks including the Pantheon, Acqua Paola Fountain, and Basilica of Sant’Andrea della Valle. The secluded spot features a large bar area, a travertine plunge pool haloed by daybeds in solid oiled teak, as well as custom bronze metal vases dotted along the outside edge of the terrace. Take a drink at the bar counter, or a swim at the end of a hot Roman day. Chef Colucci offers raw and cooked dishes inspired by her love of the Mediterranean Sea. Likewise, the cocktails use regional citrus notes, herbs and amari to create a truly Italian list.The guestrooms follow the design aesthetics that EDITION is known for, but with a pronounced Italian flare. The comfy beds are custom designed in Canaletto light walnut wood and the expansive windows bring to life this uniquely Italian tableau; Peperino stone and custom bedside tables sit alongside singular Italian artwork that adorns the walls. Each room also has a custom-made chair in beige leather, walnut wood herringbone flooring and comes equipped with a 55-inch-television. In the bathroom, guests will find a custom Carrara marble basin leaning on walnut wood, brushed brass fixtures, as well as the signature EDITION Le Labo amenities.The Rome EDITION is a unique offering, a new breed of boutique hotel that embraces the changing identity of the city and puts you are the heart of it all. With EDITION, there’s no place like Rome.The hotel is now open.The Rome EDITIONSalita di San Nicola da Tolentino 14Rome Italy 00187+39 06 4524 9000FOR MORE INFORMATION:editionhotels.com editionhotels.com/rome Facebook: /EDITIONhotels /TheRomeEDITION Instagram: @EDITIONhotels| @EDITIONRome Instagram: @animaristoranteroma Facebook: /animaristoranteroma Website : animaristoranteroma.it OpenTable: Anima Restaurant - Roma, Citta Metropolitana di Roma | OpenTableABOUT EDITION HOTELSEDITION Hotels is an unexpected and refreshing collection of individualized, customized, one-of-a-kind hotels which redefines the codes of traditional luxury.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Air Products and Chemicals'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is:15% = US$2.2b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.15 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings Growth And 15% ROETo start with, Air Products and Chemicals' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 16%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 9.3% seen over the past five years by Air Products and Chemicals.Story continuesWe then compared Air Products and Chemicals' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 13% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is APD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether APD is currently mispriced by the market.Is Air Products and Chemicals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 63% (or a retention ratio of 37%) for Air Products and Chemicals suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Air Products and Chemicals has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 51%. Regardless, the future ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is predicted to rise to 21% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we feel that Air Products and Chemicals certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings growth is decent, and the high ROE does contribute to that growth. However, investors could have benefitted even more from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Cummins in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Cummins (CMI) is an Auto-Tires-Trucks stock that has seen a price change of 2.52% so far this year. The engine maker is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.57 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.53%. This compares to the Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry's yield of 1.04% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.28 is up 4% from last year. In the past five-year period, Cummins has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.42%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Cummins's current payout ratio is 35%. This means it paid out 35% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for CMI for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $19.80 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 30.95%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, CMI presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This strategic move aligns with Air Liquide's commitment to the development of hydrogen and its focus on key strategic priorities.Canada-based Hydrogenics is a leader in electrolysis hydrogen production equipment and fuel cells. Air Liquide acquired its stake in Hydrogenics in 2019 in a strategic transaction representing an investment of $20.5 million.As a leader in developing and operating large-scale electrolyzers, Air Liquide has a significant portfolio of technologies related to hydrogen production. The divestment of its stake in Hydrogenics reflects the company's strategy of regularly reviewing its business portfolio to optimize its investments and align them with its long-term objectives. Under Cummins' full ownership, Hydrogenics will continue to serve as one of Air Liquide's suppliers for electrolyzer projects.Air Liquide's decision to sell its stake in Hydrogenics is driven by its strategic plan for 2025, known as ADVANCE. This plan aims to achieve global performance by combining financial and extra-financial dimensions.

108,08d8d05b-4d57-3a81-9d79-596c25d540ff,CMI,2023-07-05,7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now: June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safe-dividend-stocks-investors-110027474.html,1688036427,STORY,"['C', 'PFE', 'QCOM', 'CMI', 'HD', 'BG']","[Although the idea of acquiring the highest-yielding enterprises seems lucrative, investors right now should arguably focus on safe dividend stocks to buy. These securities often undergird consistently profitable companies that enjoy revenue predictability. Right now, predictability is more important ahead of an uncertain market environment.To be sure, the above warning doesn’t necessarily mean you’re stuck with sub-1% yielding entities. Far from it, on a relative scale, you can find high-yielding safe stocks. It’s just that when it comes to dividend investing, the idea is to play the long game. Therefore, you don’t want to just pocket some income one quarter and then watch your investment crash and burn the next.In fairness, with the benchmark equities index up double-digit percentages for the year, a conservative approach might not seem appropriate. Nevertheless, small fissures – such as rising unemployment – indicate that market participants should seek safety first. On that note, below are June 2023 dividend stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHome Depot (HD)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the most reliable businesses available, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) easily ranks among the safe dividend stocks to buy. Fundamentally, throughout inclement conditions, Home Depot stores stay open (when feasible), providing a vital service to customers in need. We all experienced that firsthand during the Covid-19 disaster, when Home Depot kept its doors open during the night hours so that people can purchase essential goods.To be fair, I wouldn’t classify it as one of the outright high-yielding safe stocks. However, the home improvement retailer more than holds its own with a forward yield of 2.66%. Also, its payout ratio comes in at 52.46%, which offers little cause for sustainability-related concerns. Also, it commands 14 years of annual dividend increases, a status management won’t want to give up cheaply.Story continuesOn the financials, Home Depot benefits from consistent profitability. As well, its trailing-year net margin stands at 10.75%, beating out 86.59% of its peers. On the top line, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) of 15.2%, beating out 76.53% of rivals. It makes a strong case for top dividend stocks to buy.Cummins (CMI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comBilled as a global power leader, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) designs, manufactures and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. Per its public profile, the company’s products range from diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid powertrains, and powertrain-related components. Thanks to its broad industrial relevancies, CMI in many ways makes for an ideal case for safe dividend stocks.While CMI hasn’t been off to a great performance in 2023, over the past one-year period, it gained over 22%. Financially, Cummins delivers on the operational front, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 9.3%, above 61.54% of rivals. Also, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 8.37%, above 67.38%.Despite the solid print, the market prices CMI at a forward multiple of only 12.36. As a discount to projected earnings, Cummins ranks better than 78.33% of companies listed in the industrial products space. For passive income, Cummins features a forward yield of 2.62%. With a payout ratio that sits at 32.13%, investors can trust the yield. Therefore, it’s one of the June 2023 dividend stocks to consider for conservative investors.Bunge (BG)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) makes an easy case for safe dividend stocks to buy. Thanks to the extraordinary pertinence of its business, demand should be both strong and predictable. According to its corporate profile, Bunge’s expansive network feeds and fuels a growing world, creating sustainable products and opportunities for more than 70,000 farmers and the consumers they serve across the globe.Still, relevancy doesn’t always translate to upside market performance. Since the January opener, BG fell more than 3%. In the trailing one-year period, it’s up less than 2%, which is absolutely not impressive. However, Bunge’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.7%, above 73.77% of sector players. It’s also consistently profitable, which is hardly a surprise.Notably, though, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.21, ranking favorably below 89.29% of its peers. If you want dividend investing at a bargain, Bunge might intrigue you. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 2.87% with a payout ratio that sits at 23.13%. For a balanced approach to the market, BG may be one of the top dividend stocks.Citigroup (C)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAn investment bank and financial services firm, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is one of the top sector players in the world. To be fair, the regional banking crisis might raise eyebrows in terms of labeling Citi as one of the safe dividend stocks. However, the ugliness in the banking space hasn’t yet reached the stalwarts.On the financials, Citigroup carries a rather mediocre profile. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 5%, which is a bit off the sector median of 6.1%. Also, it’s consistently profitable but with a trailing-year net margin of 19.52% (lower than the median 26.75%), C stock is hardly remarkable.So, why mention Citigroup in a list of safe dividend stocks? One reason is its multiple of 6.47. As a discount to earnings, the bank ranks better than nearly 68% of the competition. Also, C shares trade at a sales multiple of 1.16, well below the sector median of 2.14. Also, Citi happens to be one of the high-yielding safe stocks, offering a forward yield of 4.4%. Also, with a payout ratio sitting at 31.67%, it might attract some looks.Qualcomm (QCOM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAnother riskier idea among safe dividend stocks to buy, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a technology powerhouse might not seem appropriate to the underlying theme. However, as the world’s leading wireless tech innovator, the company is instrumental in the ongoing 5G rollout. As well, with advanced solutions such as artificial intelligence requiring greater connectivity, QCOM may be an ideal play for dividend investing.And on that front, it holds its own quite well with a forward yield of 2.67%. Since the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%, QCOM ranks among the high-yielding safe stocks on a relative basis. Also, the company commands 21 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, that’s a status that the firm’s leadership team won’t want to give up cheaply.On the financials, Qualcomm features a three-year revenue growth rate of 25%, beating out 78.37% of sector rivals. Also, its book growth rate during the same period impresses at 55.3%. Despite the stout figures, the market prices QCOM at a forward multiple of only 12.21. As a discount to projected earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 86.26% of the competition.Shell (SHEL)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a global hydrocarbon energy giant, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) might not seem immediately effective as one of the safe dividend stocks to buy. After all, the political and ideological winds consistently push the zero net emissions narrative. However, Shell and other fossil fuel giants should remain pertinent for many years (perhaps even decades) to come. Given the energy density of hydrocarbons, it’s a tough resource to just outright quit.Because of tough economic circumstances, SHEL posts a not-bad, not-great performance in the charts. Since the Jan. opener, the security gained just a hair over 7%. In the trailing one-year period, it moved up nearly 13%. Nevertheless, contrarians targeting dividend investing opportunities should give Shell another look. Specifically, the market prices SHEL at a forward multiple of 6.16. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 63.53% of the competition.Finally, Shell features a dividend yield of 3.61% along with a payout ratio of only 19.11%. If you’re seeking yield sustainability, SHEL warrants further investigation.Pfizer (PFE)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA pharmaceutical behemoth, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) gained both popularity and notoriety among some circles for its role in developing a Covid-19 vaccine. However, with both the pandemic itself and fears associated with the crisis fading away, PFE seems risky. Indeed, since the beginning of this year, PFE gave up 29% of equity value. At the same time, it may be one of the safe dividend stocks for patient investors.Almost invariably, Pfizer will leverage its acumen earned through messenger-RNA research to forward other viable therapeutics and vaccines. So, while the sharp revenue loss in the first quarter of this year is admittedly distracting, astute investors should look to what the pharma giant can do in the future.In the meantime, PFE trades at a compelling discount. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 10.93. As a discount to projected earnings, Pfizer ranks better than 75.78% of its peers. In closing, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 4.5% and a payout ratio of only 46.66%. Therefore, it’s also arguably one of the high-yielding safe stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company has been a prime beneficiary of the strong demand for oral care and pet nutrition products. Its focus on innovation, brand strength, stringent pricing actions, expansion of digital capabilities and accelerated revenue growth management plans has provided it with an edge compared with other market players.Colgate has been on track with its efforts to improve product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. However, the company is not immune to higher raw material and logistic costs worldwide, and unfavorable currency issues.Shares of Colgate have gained 2.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5% and the Consumer Staples sector’s rise of 0.1%. However, the stock lagged the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 9.2% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.3% and 5.7%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What Makes CL a Buy Option?Innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. CL’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, and the Hello Products LLC buyout. The company also partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. This long-term deal will bring together the world’s number one oral care brand and the number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate. This product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices.Colgate’s revenue growth management initiatives led to double-digit pricing gains worldwide in the first quarter of 2023. This led to impressive organic sales growth in the quarter.On an organic basis, Colgate’s sales advanced 10% in the first quarter, with improvements in all divisions and categories. This marked the 17th successive quarter of organic sales growth at or above its long-term target of 3-5% growth. While volumes remained soft, pricing gains of 12% aided organic sales. Bold pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans were key drivers. Expanding the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels is one of Colgate’s priorities to improve organic sales. The company is aggressively expanding into faster-growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands.In 2019, Colgate expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. It remains impressed with the performance of professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — in spas and dermatologists. The company expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. Colgate is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Colgate’s Hill's business has been a major contributor to sales growth for the past few quarters. The segment reported sales growth of 21.5% in the first quarter, with organic sales growth of 14%. Results gained from an 11.5% increase in pricing, and volume growth of 12% on a reported basis and 2.5% on an organic volume basis, partly offset by a 2% adverse currency impact. Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States and Europe.Strength in oral care and pet nutrition remains a key growth driver. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate has also been focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Management raised its sales and profit forecast for 2023. Colgate- anticipates net sales growth of 3-6%. The current projection indicates gains from the acquisitions of pet food businesses, offset by a low-single-digit adverse currency impact.The company anticipates full-year organic sales growth between 4% and 6%. CL foresees adjusted gross profit margin expansion and increased advertising investments. Management guided mid-single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space are Clorox CLX, Coty Inc.

114,55df8916-e441-3ea6-b608-677dafb245ac,DVN,2023-07-05,3 Energy Stocks That Have Big Investors Running for the Exit,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-energy-stocks-big-investors-202852227.html,1687984132,STORY,"['CVX', 'DVN', 'COP']","[The party in energy stocks looks to be over. In 2022, oil and natural gas stocks were the only market segment that saw gains, as the price of crude oil surged to $122 per barrel. Now, with oil trading below $70 a barrel, the S&amp;P 500 Energy Index is down 15% since the end of January.The share prices of the largest oil producers in the world are in retreat as a result, and energy stocks are once again trailing mega-cap tech stocks in terms of returns. Oil companies experienced a sharp reversal after posting record profits, raising dividends, and increasing stock buybacks in 2022.The current situation is unlikely to change soon, given the weakening global economy and softening energy demand, particularly in key markets like China. With the good times now at an end, we look at three energy stocks that have big investors running for the exit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDevon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOne of the mighty oil stocks that has gotten its comeuppance this year is Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). The company’s share price is down 17% year-to-date and 39% below its 52-week high. Over the past five years, DVN stock is now up less than 10%.The company’s share price has declined sharply since last November as investors sell energy stocks in droves. Even a sky-high dividend yield of 9.38%, or $1.13 a share per quarter, hasn’t been enough to keep investors holding on.Despite its low price-earnings ratio of five-times, DVN stock has been adversely affected by falling crude oil prices and weakening global demand. Despite having a dividend payment three-times higher than most stocks, Devon Energy has recently cut its dividend for three consecutive quarters. This indicates a period of retrenchment.Unfortunately, this makes Devon an energy stock to avoid right now.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comIt’s never a good sign when legendary investor Warren Buffett cuts his holding of a stock. After buying energy stocks hand over fist in 2022, Buffett appears to now be having second thoughts. In this year’s first quarter, Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B), trimmed its stake in U.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) by 20%.Story continuesPrior to the cut, CVX stock had been Berkshire Hathaway’s third-largest position behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Now, Chevron is Berkshire’s fifth-largest holding and its stake in the oil company has been reduced by about $6 billion. The 20% cut to Berkshire’s CVX stock holding came as a surprise given how aggressively Buffett had built his position in Chevron. In 2019, just before the Covid-19 pandemic, Buffett didn’t own any shares in Chevron.Buffett’s decision to sell Chevron suggests a lack of confidence in the company, and the stock has dropped accordingly. This year, CVX stock is down approximately 11%, and is down 20% from its peak.ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comHedge funds have been piling out of energy stocks this year, and one of the names they’re selling the most is ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). COP stock is down 11% year-to-date, and is 27% below its 52-week high, despite the market rebounding.COP stock has a low price-earnings ratio of 8-times and offers a dividend yield of 5.2% ($1.32 per share per quarter). But these benefits have not been enough to entice investors, especially big-time money managers.Investors worry about ConocoPhillips’ $3 billion acquisition of the remaining stake in the Surmont oil sands facility amid declining demand and oil prices. The acquisition raises concerns with respect to ConocoPhillips’ financial situation. The company has said the deal, expected to close in this year’s second half, will add $600 million in free cash flow by next year.

The growing global e-commerce market holds tremendous opportunity for the company.Fidelity National — with a market cap of $34.4 billion — provides banking and payments technology solutions, processing services and information-based services to the financial services industry. Courtesy of solid prospects, this stock is worth holding on to at the moment.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceFIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past three months, the stock has gained 8% compared with the industry’s growth of 5.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research2024 Estimates &amp; Surprise HistoryThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for FIS’ 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.52 per share, indicating a 9.5% increase from the year-ago estimated figure on 3.4% higher revenues of $15 billion.The company's earnings beat estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark once, delivering an average surprise of 2.3%.Growth DriversFidelity National is benefiting from strong recurring revenue growth across all its segments. Strong execution and improving accounts should continue to fuel top-line growth in the Banking Segment. The company expects banking organic revenues to grow between 0% and 2% in 2023. Moreover, the recent banking uncertainty is boding well for FIS, leading to growth in accounts on file serviced on its platforms and hence rising banking revenues.The company continued to benefit from increasing Capital Market revenues in the first quarter of 2023. It expects revenues in this segment to grow in the range of 4-6% in 2023. The company’s continued investments in emerging platforms like artificial intelligence and blockchain technology should continue to add value to its services.The company focuses on top-tier strategic partnerships and future-proof underlying technologies to grow its operations. The company’s growing footprint in the crypto market is praiseworthy. It has partnered with cryptocurrency platforms like Crypto.com and OKCoin to support their respective global expansions. Further, its partnership with bitcoin-focused financial services and technology provider NYDIG is likely to increase traffic to its Digital One Mobile application.Story continuesFidelity National often undertakes shareholder value-boosting measures. In the first quarter, the company returned $300 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. The company aims to maintain 35% dividend payout ratio in 2023 and expects to achieve targeted annual dividend growth parallel with adjusted net earnings growth. It has a dividend yield of 3.6%, higher than the industry’s average of 0.7%.The company does not move away from shedding non-core assets to boost efficiency and profitability. Currently, it has plans to opt for a tax-free spin-off of its Merchant Solutions business. This is expected to complete by early 2024.FIS’s valuation seems cheaper than the industry at the current level. Looking at its 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple, investors might want to pay a higher premium. FIS currently has a ratio of 9.3X, much lower than the industry’s average of 21.3X.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that are impeding the stock’s growth lately.Increasing costs are dampening its profits. Selling, general and administrative expenses witnessed a CAGR of 26% over the last five years that ended in 2022. The growing costs due to a multi-year modernization of platforms and applications are anticipated to keep its margins under pressure. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action bodes well for the long run.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Financial Transaction Services space are WEX Inc.

117,b062683d-e02f-3392-a012-3e83b399c7fc,MCD,2023-07-05,15 Franchises That Run Themselves,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-franchises-run-themselves-215643042.html,1688507803,STORY,"['MCD', 'WEN']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 15 franchises that run themselves. To skip our detailed analysis of the franchising business and its benefits, you can go take a look at 5 Franchises That Run Themselves.Franchising is an effective way to make money off of an already-established business model while also allowing entrepreneurs and small business owners to conduct their business under a bigger name to maximize their chances of success. For both parties involved in a franchising operation, there are many benefits involved. However, entrepreneurs may have more to gain since they get an opportunity to try their hand at running a business with minimized risk. In essence, franchise owners get to enjoy the perks of having the support of an overseeing party while also being able to work primarily for themselves.The franchising business model is popular among entrepreneurs because of several benefits. The popularity of this business model is evidenced by the fact that several renowned companies, such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), and Dunkin Brands Group Inc. (NASDAQ:DNKN), all operate on a franchise model. This popularity is increased among those members of the business community who want to benefit from a stable source of passive income as well. This is due to the fact that many franchises in the US and internationally actually operate as absentee owner franchises.What Is An Absentee Owner Franchise?Absentee owner franchises do not require their owners to work in them regularly. Essentially, in absentee owner franchises, management teams and staff do the job of running the franchise business while the owner of the franchise can sit back and reap the financial benefits. Many investors and retirees prefer these businesses, also referred to as passive income franchises, because they can trust a team to manage the everyday operations of the franchise business while the owner merely has to ensure that the business is performing up to a certain standard and is meeting all required benchmarks.Story continuesThe key to ensuring success for an absentee owner franchise is to ensure that your management team is strong and focused on running the business and turning a profit. Because of the many benefits associated with this form of franchise, most absentee owners consider this task to be a small one in the face of steady passive income. As such, passive income franchises are steadily becoming a popular investment move in the business world, with more investors looking for absentee franchise opportunities today.Franchise Output Forecasts For 2023When we covered the most profitable franchises in the US in one of our articles, we noted that the franchising industry is expected to continue on a strong growth course in 2023. According to the Franchising Economic Outlook report published by the International Franchise Association (IFA) in March, the total output to be generated by franchised businesses is expected to grow by 4.2% in 2023 to reach $860.1 billion. While this growth is promising, the report also mentioned that mortgage rates this year, alongside high inflation, are two factors that will limit consumer spending and possibly hurt the franchising industry.Despite this, the inflation situation in the US seems to be calming down at present. The Federal Reserve has paused its rate hikes, and markets are seeing inflation also coming down. While this does not mean that prices will fall immediately, it can signal a break for the franchising industry, considering the fact that many franchises are also evolving and implementing operational efficiencies in their systems, according to the IFA report. Technological advancements in franchises, such as kiosk ordering, digital payments, artificial intelligence software for inventory tracking, and future sales forecasting, are all helping existing franchises cope with other economic burdens. In light of this, the franchising industry seems to be an industry worth investing in, especially for absentee owners looking for passive income. This is why we have compiled a list of some of the best franchises that run themselves that are operating today. They include small franchises as well.15 Franchises That Run Themselvesdcwcreations/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo pick the franchises for our list, we searched for franchises that allow absentee owners and are profitable.

118,644e93fa-7c33-3ad0-bfe2-168d563a06d0,PLD,2023-07-05,Blackstone REIT Announces Major Asset Liquidations As Redemption Requests Continue,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackstone-reit-announces-major-asset-180808646.html,1688494088,STORY,"['BX', 'PLD']","[Blackstone real estate investment trust (BREIT), which recently made news for exercising a clause that restricted owner withdrawals for several consecutive months, has not taken the news lying down. Blackstone’s opportunistic funds recently announced the sale of $3.1 billion worth of its industrial real estate portfolio. It also is rumored to be considering a sale of its Las Vegas portfolio.Strength in the Industrial SectorAlthough much of the real estate market has suffered this year, industrial and warehouse is still a subsector where there has been year-on-year growth. Blackstone is selling 70 assets out of its opportunistic funds to Prologis Inc. The deal includes roughly 14 million square feet and marks the continuation of a long-standing relationship between Blackstone and Prologis.The sale, which is expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter, would be the latest in more than a dozen deals between Prologis and Blackstone in the last 11 years. All indications are that Prologis plans to buy and hold the assets, which would add 77 new customers to a portfolio that includes 50 customers.More importantly, the deal points to continued resilience in the industrial/warehouse sector, even as many other commercial sectors stumble in this new environment. As of April, the national average lease rate for industrial space hit $7.18 per square foot — 7% higher than the price a year ago. Perhaps that’s why an estimated $12.6 billion worth of industrial real estate was sold in the first four months of 2023.Nadeem Meghji, Head of Blackstone Real Estate Americas, said, “Where you invest matters, and this transaction demonstrates the exceptional demand for high-quality warehouses. With near record low vacancy, logistics remains a high conviction theme for us; we are proud owners of $100 billion of warehouses in North America and $175 billion in total around the world. And, of course, Prologis is a world-class company that knows this space as well as anyone.”Story continuesCheck out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Blackstone made a $13 billion bet on the growth in student housing. Here’s how you can carve out your own piece of the student housing market with just $500.Is Blackstone Looking To Raise More Money?It’s no secret that Blackstone has been restricting owner withdrawals in its REIT for almost the entire year. With that in mind, it’s not hard to imagine it is under tremendous pressure to liquidate assets. Rumors are circulating that Blackstone may sell half of the $4.25 billion interest it acquired in the Bellagio Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas in 2019.If true, it would represent the liquidation of an asset that is performing well. The Bellagio is one of the more profitable operations on the Las Vegas Strip. It’s also still under the control of the owner who opened it — MGM Grand — and in the middle of a long-term lease. Those factors make Blackstone’s share an appealing asset that will likely have many suitors if it decides to put it on the market.Blackstone has steadily been selling its casino assets in the last several years. It sold the Cosmopolitan hotel for $5.65 billion in 2021, which netted the company a profit of nearly three times its original investment. At the time, it was one of the most profitable transactions of its kind in history. In 2022, Blackstone sold 49.9% of its ownership of MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.What This Means For Real Estate InvestorsDespite being one of America’s largest landlords, Blackstone is still navigating choppy waters. The fund is liquidating assets, but the reasons are not totally clear. All real estate funds sell properties, and these could have just reached the end of their investment cycles.Or it could be a case of Blackstone trying to liquidate some high-dollar assets before interest rates go up again, which will make these types of properties more difficult to liquidate in the future.There is a kernel of wisdom here for everyday investors. First, Blackstone will eventually bounce back and so will the real estate market. Second, the industrial and warehouse sector of real estate remains strong, as evidenced by the fact it has delivered increased returns for investors year on year.A Blackstone spokesperson said, ""BREIT continues to deliver strong performance given its portfolio concentration in sectors like rental housing, logistics and data centers in the Sunbelt: 12% annualized net return since inception over six years ago, over 3x the public REIT index. We were pleased to see June repurchase requests decline meaningfully from the January peak.""If you’ve been looking to make a real estate investment but you’re spooked by the market, industrial and warehouse assets or REITs in the industrial/warehouse sector are worth considering. There is always opportunity in up or down markets if you know where to look.Read next:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

119,e1c410f9-9743-37ab-9dd5-491948e21fe1,TRIP,2023-07-05,Tripadvisor Versus GetYourGuide: Who’s Bigger and Badder in Experiences?,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-versus-getyourguide-bigger-badder-063000349.html,1688538600,STORY,['TRIP'],"[Tourists and locals checked out the popular Comuna 13 in Medellin, Colombia on February 9, 2023. Source: Dennis Schaal/Skift Dennis Schaal / SkiftTripadvisor and its Viator tours and activities brand compete against amply funded and privately held GetYourGuide as the largest players in this sector. So it was intriguing when the Tripadvisor’s CEO said at a recent investor conference that his experiences business “is larger and faster growing.”Matt Goldberg’s comments came on the same day that Softbank-backed GetYourGuide, based in Berlin, announced a $194 million investment round, and reports pegged its private valuation at nearly $2 billion.Goldberg characterized it as “a nice valuation marker” and one that he’d really “like to have.”Tripadvisor, based on its stock price Friday, is worth a little more at $2.4 billion, but that includes all its other businesses, including hotel search, various advertising programs for travel and non-travel companies, dining reservations, and more.So Tripadvisor has considered spinning off Viator, the star in its portfolio, into a separate public company to unlock some of that value, especially if it could get a GetYourGuide-like valuation.How Do Tripadvisor and GetYourGuide Stack Up in Experiences?But is Tripadvisor/Viator indeed larger than GetYourGuide and growing faster? It’s tough to say definitively because GetYourGuide is a private company and doesn’t publish its financials. But both Tripadvisor.com and its Viator brand sell tours and activities on their platforms, and the combo in experiences is indeed likely larger than GetYourGuide, said a source close to GetYourGuide.But the source argued that the GetYourGuide brand is larger than the standalone Viator brand, and is growing faster.“So when Goldberg is referring to ‘bigger,’ then it is only when you count all these together,” said the source, referring to the Tripadvisor and Viator points of sale for experiences, as well as Viator’s big distribution partnerships, such as with Booking.com. “Viator is no longer bigger than GetYourGuide.”GetYourGuide itself wouldn’t publicly comment on Goldberg’s statements.Story continuesIn its most recent press announcement, GetYourGuide stated it hosts more than 75,000 activities from over 16,000 operators, and that it has 700 employees in 17 offices in Germany, the U.S. and UK. Since Johannes Reck and Tao Tao co-founded the company in 2009, travelers from more than 150 countries have purchased over 80 million tours, activities and attractions on its platform, the company said.Tripadvisor counts more than 300,000 bookable experiences in 250,000 destinations. The vast majority of these experiences come from its Viator brand, although many are also booked on Tripadvisor.com and in its app.The edge in numbers of bookable tours and activities would appear to go to Tripadvisor over GetYourGuide, although the latter has at times focused on offering a curated set of experiences over comprehensiveness.GetYourGuide’s Growth Increases Versus Viator’sIn the first quarter, which ended March 31, Viator, which Tripadvisor acquired in 2014, recorded $115 million in revenue, more than double the year-earlier period.Viator has been the standout performer in the Tripadvisor portfolio coming out the pandemic, although it lost $30 million in the first quarter this year as it pursued growth over profits. Meanwhile, the size of GetYourGuide’s profits or losses haven’t been reported.In 2022, Viator’s revenue was 208% higher than in pre-pandemic 2019, said spokesperson Laurel Greatrix.GetYourGuide has stated publicly that in the first quarter of this year, the growth of its booking volumes was 4 times — or 300% higher than — that in the first quarter of 2019.Tripadvisor’s AdvantageBut the Tripadvisor-Viator combo in selling experiences is precisely where Tripadvisor has an edge over GetYourGuide.Viator powers things to do on Tripadvisor.com, and in so doing Viator gets “an audience with potentially hundreds of millions of additional, qualified travelers,” said Greatrix of Viator. “We’ve only scratched the surface of this, and that’s what Tripadvisor’s updated strategic focus, in part, sets out to, and is, changing.”Tripadvisor was the most-visited travel and tourism website in the United States in May 2023 with 180 million visits on desktop and mobile, according to Similarweb.“In Q1 2023, we exposed 14 million more travelers to experiences content than we did in Q1 last year,” Greatrix said. “It’s a significant part of what drove Viator’s Q1 success, and one reason the Tripadvisor and Viator relationship is so strategically compelling for both brands.”Online Travel Agency Model or Standalone Like GetYourGuideBased on his conversations with leaders of companies that process tours and activities reservations, Peter Syme, a partner in Tourpreneur, which provides advice to tour operators, said he thinks Tripadvisor is likely leading in the U.S., and that Europe-based GetYourGuide is likely winning there.“GetYourGuide obviously need a IPO window to open at some point whereas Viator has more options,” Syme said. “If I was placing my own money on them I would bet on Viator, but then again I am not a fan of standalone tours and activity OTA [online travel agency] business models. The cost of acquiring customers is high and the lifetime value of the customer is low, and repeat purchases is rare.”The Offline Channel Is the Real LeaderWhile most agree that Tripadvisor-Viator and GetYourGuide are the two leading tours and activities platforms in the world, online travel agencies collectively have less than 10% share of a market that is still mostly offline.

For more stocks on this list, head on over to Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks for 20 Years.The world of investments is not for those that are prone to panicking easily. Over a few years, stocks previously believed to be impervious to typical market downturns have experienced significant declines, only to rebound briefly before facing further declines. At the center of this whirlwind, lies the Federal Reserve’s primary policy tool: interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to slow the amount of money circulating through the economy and drive down aggregate demand. With higher interest rates, there should be lower demand for goods and services, and the prices for those goods and services should fall as a consequence. Of course, the Federal Reserve doesn't always increase its interest rates in a linear fashion. Following a streak of 10 consecutive meetings where rates were increased, occasionally by as much as three-quarters of a point per meeting, the Fed decided to forgo the June gathering. In this environment, investors are currently anticipating a resumption of rate hikes in July, with the possibility of the Fed assessing the need for additional increases during alternate sessions, a pace that has been observed in previous periods of tightening.The discussion around a potential economic recession has resurfaced with the participation of another Federal Reserve official in the debate over future interest rate increases. Mary Daly, the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, expressed in an exclusive interview with Reuters that there is a genuine possibility of two additional interest rate hikes occurring within the remainder of this year. In contrast to the previous year, where the risk of uncontrollable inflation outweighed the risk of excessively slowing down the economy, the current situation presents a shift in risks. Now, the risks lie in the potential consequences of taking too little action on interest rates compared to the risks associated with taking too many measures. According to Daly, her community advisory council and other business contacts have consistently expressed their concerns regarding two major issues: persistently high inflation and ongoing labor shortages. The personal consumption expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 4.4%. Although this is a decline from the peak of 7% observed last summer, it still remains more than double the Fed's target of 2%. Additionally, the unemployment rate has slightly increased to 3.7%, which remains lower than the 4% rate estimated by Fed policymakersStory continuesLong-term investment in the stock market is arguably the most reliable method to grow your wealth. Long-term investors disregard the volatile fluctuations of stock markets that occur in the short term. Instead of being entangled in the theatrics, they choose to invest in the stocks of established companies known for their consistent and enduring performance, spanning years, or perhaps even decades. By adopting this approach, investors can shield their investments from temporary headwinds, such as the ones witnessed during the economic downturn of the previous year. As an example, the Nasdaq Composite index experienced a steep decline of 33% in 2022. Nevertheless, due to the alleviation of inflationary pressures, the index has surged by 29.9% year-to-date, resulting in a remarkable 79.65% growth over the past five years, despite recent adversities. As a consequence, investors who withdrew their investments during the market lows of 2022 will miss out on the gradual rebound witnessed this year.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some great stocks for a long term portfolio, out of which the top picks include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). If you wish to see more stocks that possess long term potential, you can check out our article on the 15 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts.Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 20 YearsOur MethodologyIn order to compile our selection of top long-term stocks, we began by analyzing the stock portfolios of several prominent long-term investors, including value investor David Abrams, Baupost Group's Seth Klarman, and Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. We then chose the stock holdings that have remained within some of their portfolios for 5 years or more. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey's survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is an American nationwide automotive dealership group headquartered in Medford, Oregon. The third largest new vehicle automotive dealership group in the United States, the company offers a diverse array of services that encompass the purchase of both new and pre-owned vehicles, various vehicle financing alternatives, warranties, insurance plans, theft protection services, as well as comprehensive automotive repair and maintenance solutions. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) has been part of value investor David Abrams portfolio since Q2 2018, signifying his trust in the stock's long-term viability.On April 19, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend, a 19% increase from its prior dividend of $0.42. The dividend was paid on May 26, to shareholders of record on May 12.As of the March quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared with 40 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $1.7 billion.Right Tail Capital mentioned Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The original research premise fit right into Right Tail’s wheelhouse: a set of good businesses trading at attractive long-term valuations. Valuations look inexpensive at mid to high single digit multiples of earnings. Historically, these businesses have traded at 10-15x P/E multiples despite having more leverage and holding more inventory than they do today. In some ways, the historical multiples feel appropriate given their delicate relationships with manufacturers and cyclicality; on the other hand, these businesses have produced solid mid-teens returns with attractive reinvestment opportunities suggesting they are better than average companies. Adding another wrinkle to the puzzle, these businesses have over-earned the last few years due to Covid (car shortages, consumers flush with cash, etc.).As I began the work, the compelling return potential warranted additional research. Lithia Motors (LAD), for example, has laid out a 2025 earnings per share target of $55-60. If the company reaches $55 in earnings and trades at a 12x P/E, we’d have a stock price of $660 – this would be a triple from today’s prices and produce a ~45% IRR over 3 years. The businesses are also producing lots of cash currently (LAD has earned ~$40 per share the last few years) creating additional capital allocation optionality.”Much like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is a top long term stock finding favor with hedge funds.9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), often referred to as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been a part of legendary value investor Warren Buffett's portfolio for over 12 years.On May 17, Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, reaffirmed an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stock while raising the target price from $355 to $360. Silber believes that Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has the potential for a significant upside of more than 16% based on the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Founded in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational corporation recognized primarily for its production of Coca-Cola. Beyond its flagship beverage, the company engages in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse range of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) stands as one of the largest beverage corporations in the world and holds a noteworthy place among the longstanding investments of legendary value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has held a stake within the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain the company's shares.On April 26, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock’s dividend yield on June 28 came in at 3.04%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational financial services corporation that specializes in payment cards. Headquartered in New York City, it is one of the most valuable companies in the world and one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.4% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for American Express American Express' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, prior to this announcement, American Express' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 44.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAmerican Express Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.80 total annually to $2.40. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. American Express has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.American Express Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

MDLZ looks well-placed due to its expansion endeavors, especially acquisitions. The company has been particularly focused on the chocolate and biscuit categories.These factors, along with efficient pricing actions, have been working well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company amid elevated cost concerns. Shares of the company have rallied 11.1% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.Let’s delve deeper.Prudent Acquisitions AidMondelez has been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions and alliances. The company closed the Ricolino buyout in the third quarter of 2022, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business.Further, in August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar. Mondelez acquired the Chipita S.A. business in January 2022, which is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from the Ricolino, Clif Bar and Chipita buyouts boosted net revenues in the first quarter of 2023.Prior to this, in 2021, Mondelez took over a renowned sports performance and active nutrition brand — Grenade. The company acquired the Australia-based food company — Gourmet Food Holdings — which operates in the premium biscuit and cracker category.Moreover, Mondelez completed the acquisition of Hu Master Holdings, the parent company of Hu Products on Jan 4, 2022. MDLZ’s focus on undertaking acquisitions to gain scale in its categories and distribution capabilities bodes well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on Core CategoriesMondelez has been expanding its snacking category in particular. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.The company’s core chocolate and biscuits categories remain sustainable in both developed and emerging markets. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2023. Management is focused on expanding these categories as they have considerable scope for growth (in terms of penetration and per capita consumption). Mondelez intends to generate around 90% of its revenues through these two core categories in the long run.Story continuesCost Woes to be Countered?Mondelez has been battling cost inflation for a while now. In the first quarter of 2023, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 170 basis points (bps) to 37.1% due to increased raw material and transportation costs.Also, the adjusted operating income margin contracted by 60 bps to 17.2% due to inflated input costs. In its first-quarter 2023 earnings release, MDLZ stated that it expects another year of double-digit inflation stemming from the continued elevated costs of packaging, energy, ingredients and labor.However, the company has been undertaking robust pricing actions to offset cost inflation. Favorable pricing and volumes contributed to organic net revenue growth in the first quarter.  For 2023, Mondelez expects organic net revenue growth of more than 10%. Management anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth on a constant-currency basis of more than 10%.Solid Staple StocksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are Nomad Foods NOMD, Celsius Holdings CELH and Lamb Weston LW.Nomad Foods, a frozen food product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

NXGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and continued demand for its solutions are expected to contribute further. NextGen’s dependence on third-party partners and stiff competition pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 7.5% compared with a 29.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 16.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global provider of innovative and cloud-based healthcare technology solutions has a market capitalization of $1.07 billion. NextGen projects 10.2% growth for fiscal 2024 and expects to maintain a strong performance. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 3.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Solid Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about NextGen’s innovative cloud-based healthcare technology solutions that empower healthcare practices. Its portfolio includes tightly integrated solutions that deliver on ambulatory healthcare imperatives, including consumerism, digitization, risk allocation, regulatory influence and integrated care and health equity.In March, NextGen announced the launch of Mirth Cloud Connect, a cloud-based solution that provides interoperability as a managed solution.Solid Demand for NextGen Solutions: We are optimistic about NextGen’s continued benefit from strong demand for its NextGen solutions that include Hospitals, electronic health record (EHR) and practice management (PM). NextGen’s Inpatient Clinicals, Lab and Patient Portal EHR solutions have also been gaining considerable traction.In June, NextGen announced that Haymarket Center had chosen NextGen Enterprise EHR and NextGen PM to deliver 24/7 whole-person care in Illinois.Strong Q4 Results: NextGen’s solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company saw a solid uptick in the top line and strength in both Recurring and Non-recurring revenues. Robust increases in Subscription services, Managed services and Transactional and data services revenues were also registered. The continued integration of TSI Healthcare also looks promising for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesDependence on Third-Party Partners: NextGen is subject to several risks associated with having a portion of its assets and operations located in India and using third-party service providers in India and other countries. Various factors, such as changes in the current Government of India, could trigger significant changes in India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and NextGen’s business in particular.Stiff Competition: The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive, and NextGen faces significant competition from various sources. Several of its competitors have substantially greater resources, while some of the larger competitors have greater scale than NextGen. Transaction-induced pressures or other related factors may result in price erosion or other negative market dynamics that could adversely affect NextGen’s business.Estimate TrendNextGen is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024.

The raised 2023 guidance is a major upside. However, mounting expenses and stiff competition do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has surged 88.5% against a 9.7% decline of the industry and a 18% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $16.84 billion. The company’s next-year expected growth rate of 36.2% compares favorably with the industry’s growth projection of 10%.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ1 Upsides: Exact Sciences exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The quarterly loss narrowed significantly from the year-ago period’s levels. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to first-quarter top line. During the quarter, 10,000 new healthcare professionals ordered Cologuard, bringing the total to over 312,000. The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages. The raised 2023 guidance is another upside.Enhancing Cologuard Growth: The company is currently focusing on three areas to enhance Cologuard growth.  Building the best and most effective commercial organization in healthcare by investing in the leadership team, training, and sales force effectiveness is the first strategy. Secondly, improving the customer experience by making it simpler to order Cologuard electronically and continue rescreening patients every three years. Screening more people starting at age 45 to catch cancer earlier is the final strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer the first-quarter earnings update, the company recently ran next-generation Cologuard on nearly 7,700 blinded DeeP-C samples. The second prospective study will provide valuable evidence supporting next-generation Cologuard's clinical value and competitively unique position. In multi-cancer early detection, it plans to share two additional sets of case-control data this year, validating the comprehensive multi-marker class approach.Story continuesRaised Guidance: The company raised its 2023 revenue guidance to the range of $2.380-$2.420 billion (from the earlier guidance of $2.265-$2.315 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.26 billion.For 2023, the company expects its Screening revenues in the range of $1.770-$1.795 billion ($1.660-$1.690 billion). The company expects Precision Oncology revenues in the range of $605-$620 million ($600-$620 million). COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be $5 million (unchanged).DownsidesEscalating Costs: Exact Science resorted to several strategies to improve its revenue performance. These include portfolio expansion and penetration in the international arena. So far, this has escalated costs and operating expenses for the company.In the first quarter of 2023, Exact Sciences’ general and administrative expenses rose 27.9%. Adjusted operating expenses dropped 0.9% year over year. The escalating costs are exerting significant pressure on the company’s bottom line.Tough Competitive Landscape: Given the large market for colorectal cancer screening, Exact Science faces numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than the company.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exact Sciences’ loss for 2023 has moved 39.1% north to ($2.07).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.41 billion, suggesting a 15.8% rise from the 2022 reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

""With this important milestone, we move ever closer to our goal of providing medicines that treat the underlying cause of CF to all people living with the disease.""""CF symptoms and organ damage can manifest very early in life, so it is crucial to start treatment as early as possible,"" said Silvia Gartner, M.D., specialist in Pediatrics and Pneumonology, Coordinator of the Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Center, Barcelona. ""Today’s approval provides us with a medicine that gives a window of opportunity to possibly delay the onset of CF for these very young eligible children.""ORKAMBI® has also been approved by regulatory authorities in the U.S., in Great Britain, Australia and Canada, for people with CF and two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, ages 1 and above.As a result of long-term reimbursement agreements in Austria, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, and provisions for access in health care systems such as Germany, eligible patients in these countries will have access to the expanded indication for ORKAMBI® shortly following regulatory approval by the European Commission. As a result of the long-term reimbursement agreement in the UK, children ages 1 to &lt;2 years old in the UK have had access to this expanded indication for ORKAMBI® since MHRA approval in March 2023. Vertex will continue to work with reimbursement bodies across the European Union, Australia and Canada to ensure access for all eligible patients.Story continuesAbout Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 88,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor)In people with two copies of the F508del mutation, the CFTR protein is not processed and trafficked normally within the cell, resulting in little to no CFTR protein at the cell surface.ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) is an oral medicine that is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Lumacaftor is designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del-CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of lumacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 1 year and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in their CFTR gene.The complete product information will be available on www.ema.europa.eu.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $795.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 30, 2027.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Apart from manufacturing missiles as well as space and tanker aircraft, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of defense aircraft and jet components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

For more stocks on this list, head on over to Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks for 20 Years.The world of investments is not for those that are prone to panicking easily. Over a few years, stocks previously believed to be impervious to typical market downturns have experienced significant declines, only to rebound briefly before facing further declines. At the center of this whirlwind, lies the Federal Reserve’s primary policy tool: interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to slow the amount of money circulating through the economy and drive down aggregate demand. With higher interest rates, there should be lower demand for goods and services, and the prices for those goods and services should fall as a consequence. Of course, the Federal Reserve doesn't always increase its interest rates in a linear fashion. Following a streak of 10 consecutive meetings where rates were increased, occasionally by as much as three-quarters of a point per meeting, the Fed decided to forgo the June gathering. In this environment, investors are currently anticipating a resumption of rate hikes in July, with the possibility of the Fed assessing the need for additional increases during alternate sessions, a pace that has been observed in previous periods of tightening.The discussion around a potential economic recession has resurfaced with the participation of another Federal Reserve official in the debate over future interest rate increases. Mary Daly, the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, expressed in an exclusive interview with Reuters that there is a genuine possibility of two additional interest rate hikes occurring within the remainder of this year. In contrast to the previous year, where the risk of uncontrollable inflation outweighed the risk of excessively slowing down the economy, the current situation presents a shift in risks. Now, the risks lie in the potential consequences of taking too little action on interest rates compared to the risks associated with taking too many measures. According to Daly, her community advisory council and other business contacts have consistently expressed their concerns regarding two major issues: persistently high inflation and ongoing labor shortages. The personal consumption expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 4.4%. Although this is a decline from the peak of 7% observed last summer, it still remains more than double the Fed's target of 2%. Additionally, the unemployment rate has slightly increased to 3.7%, which remains lower than the 4% rate estimated by Fed policymakersStory continuesLong-term investment in the stock market is arguably the most reliable method to grow your wealth. Long-term investors disregard the volatile fluctuations of stock markets that occur in the short term. Instead of being entangled in the theatrics, they choose to invest in the stocks of established companies known for their consistent and enduring performance, spanning years, or perhaps even decades. By adopting this approach, investors can shield their investments from temporary headwinds, such as the ones witnessed during the economic downturn of the previous year. As an example, the Nasdaq Composite index experienced a steep decline of 33% in 2022. Nevertheless, due to the alleviation of inflationary pressures, the index has surged by 29.9% year-to-date, resulting in a remarkable 79.65% growth over the past five years, despite recent adversities. As a consequence, investors who withdrew their investments during the market lows of 2022 will miss out on the gradual rebound witnessed this year.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some great stocks for a long term portfolio, out of which the top picks include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). If you wish to see more stocks that possess long term potential, you can check out our article on the 15 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts.Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 20 YearsOur MethodologyIn order to compile our selection of top long-term stocks, we began by analyzing the stock portfolios of several prominent long-term investors, including value investor David Abrams, Baupost Group's Seth Klarman, and Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. We then chose the stock holdings that have remained within some of their portfolios for 5 years or more. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey's survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is an American nationwide automotive dealership group headquartered in Medford, Oregon. The third largest new vehicle automotive dealership group in the United States, the company offers a diverse array of services that encompass the purchase of both new and pre-owned vehicles, various vehicle financing alternatives, warranties, insurance plans, theft protection services, as well as comprehensive automotive repair and maintenance solutions. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) has been part of value investor David Abrams portfolio since Q2 2018, signifying his trust in the stock's long-term viability.On April 19, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend, a 19% increase from its prior dividend of $0.42. The dividend was paid on May 26, to shareholders of record on May 12.As of the March quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared with 40 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $1.7 billion.Right Tail Capital mentioned Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The original research premise fit right into Right Tail’s wheelhouse: a set of good businesses trading at attractive long-term valuations. Valuations look inexpensive at mid to high single digit multiples of earnings. Historically, these businesses have traded at 10-15x P/E multiples despite having more leverage and holding more inventory than they do today. In some ways, the historical multiples feel appropriate given their delicate relationships with manufacturers and cyclicality; on the other hand, these businesses have produced solid mid-teens returns with attractive reinvestment opportunities suggesting they are better than average companies. Adding another wrinkle to the puzzle, these businesses have over-earned the last few years due to Covid (car shortages, consumers flush with cash, etc.).As I began the work, the compelling return potential warranted additional research. Lithia Motors (LAD), for example, has laid out a 2025 earnings per share target of $55-60. If the company reaches $55 in earnings and trades at a 12x P/E, we’d have a stock price of $660 – this would be a triple from today’s prices and produce a ~45% IRR over 3 years. The businesses are also producing lots of cash currently (LAD has earned ~$40 per share the last few years) creating additional capital allocation optionality.”Much like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) is a top long term stock finding favor with hedge funds.9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), often referred to as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has been a part of legendary value investor Warren Buffett's portfolio for over 12 years.On May 17, Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, reaffirmed an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stock while raising the target price from $355 to $360. Silber believes that Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has the potential for a significant upside of more than 16% based on the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Founded in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational corporation recognized primarily for its production of Coca-Cola. Beyond its flagship beverage, the company engages in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse range of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) stands as one of the largest beverage corporations in the world and holds a noteworthy place among the longstanding investments of legendary value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has held a stake within the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain the company's shares.On April 26, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock’s dividend yield on June 28 came in at 3.04%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational financial services corporation that specializes in payment cards. Headquartered in New York City, it is one of the most valuable companies in the world and one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The pharmaceutical company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 62 years, and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.19 per share with a dividend yield of 3.09%, as of June 28.By the end of 2023’s first quarter, 86 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the healthcare company.

(NYSE:LYB),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-lyondellbasell-industries-130049728.html,1688475649,STORY,['LYB'],"[Key InsightsLyondellBasell Industries' estimated fair value is US$99.20 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityLyondellBasell Industries' US$92.61 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimateOur fair value estimate is similar to LyondellBasell Industries' analyst price target of US$99.33Does the July share price for LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.09bUS$3.36bUS$4.02bUS$3.14bUS$2.66bUS$2.40bUS$2.24bUS$2.16bUS$2.11bUS$2.10bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -15.18%Est @ -9.99%Est @ -6.36%Est @ -3.82%Est @ -2.04%Est @ -0.80% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$3.1kUS$2.2kUS$1.7kUS$1.4kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$990US$903(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.1%) = US$32bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$32b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$32b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$92.6, the company appears about fair value at a 6.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.125. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LyondellBasell IndustriesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For LyondellBasell Industries, we've put together three further aspects you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at General Electric’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for General Electric What's The Opportunity In General Electric?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13.56% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy General Electric today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $95.35, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because General Electric’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of General Electric look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for General Electric, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, GE appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GE for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on GE should the price fluctuate below its true value.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing General Electric at this point in time. When we did our research, we found 2 warning signs for General Electric (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.If you are no longer interested in General Electric, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our industry analysis you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the US.Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States. The US healthcare segment accounts for nearly 20% of the country’s GDP. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services reports that the industry is expected to grow at an average of 5.1% between 2021 and 2030 and reach approximately $7 trillion. Among the US states, South Dakota has the highest healthcare costs at $11,736 per person and the lowest per-person healthcare costs were recorded in New Mexico. We also discussed other factors causing high healthcare costs in our article entitled 20 American Cities With the Lowest Uninsured Rates.The high healthcare costs have resulted in almost every US citizen opting for health insurance. We previously reported that close to 92% of the US population is covered by either private or public health insurance in 2021. Between 2020 and 2021, the insured population in the US grew by almost 900,000. According to Grand View Research, the US health insurance market size was approximately $1.6 trillion in 2022, and between 2023 and 2030, it is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 6.08%.Health Insurance Industry Latest UpdatesThe health insurance premium costs remained stagnant for four years till 2022. In 2023, the premiums experienced a median increase of 4% for the lowest-price silver plan. According to a survey, the global healthcare benefit costs could reach their highest in 15 years in 2023. The survey also expects that the cost would increase over the next three years and estimates a 10% increase in 2023. CEO of Domestic Health and Health Services at Cigna International Markets, Jerome Droesh said:""Inflationary trends will see an increase in costs. Many insurance companies will be required to shift their business models to increase adoption of disruptive technologies such as cloud computing and applied AI.”Story continuesOn June 14, the largest health insurance company in the world, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) said that the company’s costs were increasing due to a rise in surgeries among older adults, especially knee and hip. This hint of a drop in the health insurance company’s profit sent the company’s stock in a decline, along with a few other Medicare-focused insurers. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s executives said that now that the pandemic has waned out, older people over the age of 65 are opting for procedures that they had pushed off for a while. On June 16, Wells Fargo analysts noted that the managed healthcare stocks have a history of rallying back. Since the initial comments by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), its stock has gained over 3.7%.UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) predicts that health insurance costs could rise by $250 million to $500 million in 2023 alone due to pickleball-related injuries.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to LKQ's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for LKQ How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LKQ is:20% = US$1.1b ÷ US$5.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.LKQ's Earnings Growth And 20% ROEAt first glance, LKQ seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 20%. This certainly adds some context to LKQ's exceptional 22% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing LKQ's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 22% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is LKQ fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is LKQ Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?LKQ has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 21%, meaning that it has the remaining 79% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Along with seeing a growth in earnings, LKQ only recently started paying dividends. Its quite possible that the company was looking to impress its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 28% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with LKQ's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on a million-dollar retirement, and retiring in the Caribbean, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in the Caribbean.A Million Dollar RetirementPreviously, a comfortable retirement in the USA cost an estimated $1 million. However, a million dollars may be insufficient for the retiree today. Julian B. Morris, CFP at Concierge Wealth Management, notes,“$1 million likely isn’t enough for retirement anymore because the cost of living has continued to rise from previous generations.”Human beings are also living longer, Morris notes. Due to this reason, it is quite difficult that the amount will cover healthcare expenses for a longer period of time. Adding to the challenges, social security is projected to be depleted by 2033, further exacerbating the financial concerns of retirees.Northwestern Mutual's 2023 Planning &amp; Progress Study has updated the $1 million forecast, specifying that Americans now require a minimum of $1.27 million to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Working for decades amidst the rising inflation, every potential retiree needs passive income and peace of mind. Nest eggs work as a support system in this regard, complementing social security benefits to help retirees manage expenses throughout their retirement years.Apart from nest eggs, dividends can also act as a strong retirement foundation, notes the Motley Fool. Some stocks to add to your early retirement portfolio include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD). Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a healthcare conglomerate selling medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs. The legendary dividend payer has a manageable dividend payout ratio at 73%.Similarly, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is the king of household staples. Boasting one of the longest dividend growth streaks of Wall Street, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) is offering a solid dividend yield of 2.5% that retirees can gain an advantage out of. Finally, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) operates in a multimillion-dollar industry, increasing its dividends over the last 14 years. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) also boasts a dividend payout ratio of 60% and a solid 2.8% yield.Story continuesApart from these stocks, healthcare stocks can also be beneficial to invest in. One study notes that, on average, healthcare stocks are 23% less volatile than other stocks. Some best healthcare stocks to buy include Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Retiring in the CaribbeanPotential retirees aren’t able to save for their retirement years, with lack of financial knowledge being a major cause. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that 40% of workers don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, adding to the challenge. As such, many retirees choose to relocate to different areas within the States, as well as around the world, that can help them stretch their retirement savings.Some of the best places to retire in the world on social security include Chitré, Panama; Georgetown, Malaysia; Madrid, Spain; and Abruzzo, Italy. While these places help retirees stretch their dollar incomes further, many potential retirees would skip them to live on an island instead. Fun, adventure, and beaches are the top reasons retirees love to live on an island.As such, the best islands to move and start over include Malta; Mallorca; Spain, Penang, Malaysia; and Ambergris Caye, Belize; to name a few. For those who wish to stay within the States, some of the best U.S. islands to retire to include Hilton Head Island and Kiawah Island in South Carolina, Maui and Oahu in Hawaii, and Amelia Island in Florida.Another favorite hotspot amongst retirees is the Caribbean. Lower cost of living, established expat communities, rich culture, retirement-friendly policies, and plentiful chances at recreation are some of the reasons retirees wish to move here. Retirees especially love Dominica, as it is one of the best Caribbean islands to retire cheaply. Many individuals also choose to retire early and elope to the islands. With the right retirement strategies, many individuals have been able to move to the Caribbean as early as 39 and 40, reports CNBC. For such couples looking to retire early, Jamaica can be the best Caribbean island to live with a family.Topping all of these locations is Montserrat. Retirepedia deems Montserrat as the safest place to retire in the Caribbean. The British territory is located in the Leeward Islands, offering coral reefs, black sand beaches, and exciting seaside caves. If all of this excites you to consider retiring to the Caribbean, we have drafted an entire list of the best places you can retire to.15 Best Places to Retire in the CaribbeanMethodologyIn order to compile the list of the top places to retire in the Caribbean, we have used a scoring system based on the number of times each place appeared on a source. For this reason, we have used a total of 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources. Each place got 2 points every time it appeared on our list of sources.The scores were totaled, and places were ranked from the lowest to the highest scores. For places with the same scores, tie-breaking was done based on the cost of living. Out of two places with the same scores, those with a lower cost of living were awarded 0.1 points. Similarly, three places with the same scores were awarded 0.2 points for the least cost of living, 0.1 points for the second lowest cost of living, and so on.Note: Even though Honduras and Belize are not technically part of the Caribbean, we've added them in our list because they share similar characteristics with other Caribbean countries.Here are the best countries to retire in the Caribbean:15.

The idea of earning passive income is attractive, especially for consumers planning for retirement. However, companies change, and this can hurt investors if their portfolios continue on autopilot for too long.Previously high-conviction stocks can turn into duds as economic conditions and company fundamentals shift. Some stocks appear to be on the brink of collapse and stage great recoveries, but those are the exceptions rather than the rule. It also isn’t practical for investors to take bets on risky dividend stocks when other companies offer healthier balance sheets and steady cash flow. It’s important for investors to monitor their portfolios and adjust course when necessary. When a dividend stock loses its spark, investors should consider walking away from it. While some dividend stocks can stage comebacks, it’s unlikely that these three stocks recover any time soon. These are three dividend stocks to avoid.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAT&amp;T (T)Multiple hands holding up their cell phonesSource: ShutterstockAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) was once the poster child for dividend income investors. Investors touted the company as a stable telecom stock delivering a dividend yield that usually hovered at around 7%. The dividend yield is still at roughly 7%, but that’s the product of a dividend cut and significant depreciation of shares.AT&amp;T’s revenue only jumped by a measly 1.4% year-over-year in the first quarter, and that’s somehow progress given AT&amp;T’s performance in the previous quarter. Minimal revenue growth has been accompanied by declining net income, a nasty combination for any dividend stock. The firm is sitting on $1 billion in free cash flow which doesn’t put it in a good spot, certainly not one able to support the company’s recently cut dividend. It costs AT&amp;T $2.1 billion per quarter to give out dividends, and free cash flow concerns may lead to another cut.Story continuesTo make matters worse, AT&amp;T’s balance sheet shows total current assets of $29.9 billion and total current liabilities of $58.2 billion. In short, AT&amp;T is a sinking ship that happens to have a high dividend yield. Some investors will still buy AT&amp;T because of the high yield, but should remember it is high for a reason. Some dividend yields are too good to be true, and AT&amp;T fits that description. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)Large supermarket in a shopping center abandoned and boarded upSource: Carolyn Franks / Shutterstock.comVornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) finds itself in a tough spot as the commercial real estate conglomerate navigates shifts in workplace trends. The company has declined by over 75% within the past five years. The company’s commercial real estate holdings in cities like Chicago, New York, and San Francisco are set to lose value as more people opt to work from home. Return to office efforts don’t seem to be working, commercial loan defaults are weakening cities, and employees are leaving cities for more affordable living. WeWork’s (NYSE:WE) impending bankruptcy will make matters worse by potentially flooding the market with 20 million square feet of commercial real estate. Things aren’t looking good for commercial real estate in general, especially for Vornado Realty Trust. The REIT recently paused its dividend for the rest of 2023. Net income dropped from $26.8 million to $5.2 million in one year. The combination of recent commercial real estate trends and this dramatic drop in net income suggests the dividend may not return for a long time. Further, Vornado’s recent dividend history has been unimpressive and makes the sudden pause understandable. The firm’s logical decision to pause the dividend doesn’t mean investors have to stay on the ride.Kohl’s (KSS)Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's storeSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.comKohl’s (NYSE:KSS) shareholders have been on a tough ride for a while. The stock is down by roughly 40% over the past year and has shed approximately 70% of its market cap over the past five years. The company did not raise its dividend last year which is never a good sign for a dividend stock. In the most recent earnings report, Kohl’s reported a 3.3% year-over-year decrease in net sales and flat income which came to $14 million and $0.13 per share. That $0.13 EPS is important to keep in mind since Kohl’s currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. A dividend cut is bound to take place in the future.Kohl’s also finds itself in a challenging industry. Rising retail theft has hurt several companies, and the return of student loan payments at the end of August can curb discretionary spending. This trend can force Kohl’s to lower prices to get rid of inventory and incur more losses.Kohl’s Chief Financial Officer told analysts during the earnings call that losses from retail theft will continue to grow in 2023. It’s hard to envision a rapidly declining company in an unfavorable industry pulling off a recovery or even managing to maintain the current dividend for much longer.

153,3634ff1b-f673-3623-b6a9-53d757ea10e6,DHI,2023-07-05,Here's Why D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-d-r-horton-110051897.html,1688554851,STORY,['DHI'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How Much Debt Does D.R. Horton Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2023 D.R. Horton had US$5.99b of debt, an increase on US$5.67b, over one year. However, it does have US$2.77b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$3.23b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At D.R. Horton's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that D.R. Horton had liabilities of US$5.55b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$4.50b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$2.77b in cash and US$282.3m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$7.00b.Given D.R. Horton has a humongous market capitalization of US$41.0b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.D.R. Horton's net debt is only 0.47 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 1k times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Fortunately, D.R. Horton grew its EBIT by 3.8% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if D.R. Horton can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. In the last three years, D.R. Horton's free cash flow amounted to 22% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.Our ViewBoth D.R. Horton's ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT and its net debt to EBITDA gave us comfort that it can handle its debt. Having said that, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow somewhat sensitizes us to potential future risks to the balance sheet. Considering this range of data points, we think D.R. Horton is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with D.R. Horton .When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, management recently issued a bullish forecast for second-quarter 2023. AAL raised its second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) (excluding net special items) view in the range of $1.45-$1.65 (earlier guidance: $1.20-$1.40). The adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the 12.5-14.5% band (earlier guidance:11-13%). Average fuel cost per gallon is now expected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 (earlier guidance: $2.65-$2.75).AAL now expects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to decline 1%-3% from second-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier estimate was for a 2-4% decline).Non-fuel unit costs are still expected to increase 3.5-5.5% year over year. Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are still estimated to increase 3.5-5.5% year over year. For 2023, AAL has reinstated its outlook. Management still expects available seat miles to increase 5-8% year over year. Our model estimates an increase of 6.1% year over year. Non-fuel unit costs are still expected to increase 2-5% year over year. Our estimate hints at a 3.4% year-over-year increase. AAL still expects EPS (excluding net special items) in the $2.50-$3.50 range.The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025-end. The company aims to attain this objective through naturally occurring amortization. Also, it intends to utilize surplus cash and free cash flow to pay down prepayable debt. As of Mar 31, 2023, the carrier reduced its debt levels by more than $9 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderAmerican Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.

To skip our industry analysis you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the US.Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States. The US healthcare segment accounts for nearly 20% of the country’s GDP. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services reports that the industry is expected to grow at an average of 5.1% between 2021 and 2030 and reach approximately $7 trillion. Among the US states, South Dakota has the highest healthcare costs at $11,736 per person and the lowest per-person healthcare costs were recorded in New Mexico. We also discussed other factors causing high healthcare costs in our article entitled 20 American Cities With the Lowest Uninsured Rates.The high healthcare costs have resulted in almost every US citizen opting for health insurance. We previously reported that close to 92% of the US population is covered by either private or public health insurance in 2021. Between 2020 and 2021, the insured population in the US grew by almost 900,000. According to Grand View Research, the US health insurance market size was approximately $1.6 trillion in 2022, and between 2023 and 2030, it is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 6.08%.Health Insurance Industry Latest UpdatesThe health insurance premium costs remained stagnant for four years till 2022. In 2023, the premiums experienced a median increase of 4% for the lowest-price silver plan. According to a survey, the global healthcare benefit costs could reach their highest in 15 years in 2023. The survey also expects that the cost would increase over the next three years and estimates a 10% increase in 2023.

Many insurance companies will be required to shift their business models to increase adoption of disruptive technologies such as cloud computing and applied AI.”Story continuesOn June 14, the largest health insurance company in the world, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) said that the company’s costs were increasing due to a rise in surgeries among older adults, especially knee and hip. This hint of a drop in the health insurance company’s profit sent the company’s stock in a decline, along with a few other Medicare-focused insurers. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s executives said that now that the pandemic has waned out, older people over the age of 65 are opting for procedures that they had pushed off for a while.

Since the initial comments by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), its stock has gained over 3.7%.UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) predicts that health insurance costs could rise by $250 million to $500 million in 2023 alone due to pickleball-related injuries.

We will also look at emerging trends in hospitals around the US while exploring the presence and significance of the best healthcare systems and for-profit hospitals in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best For-Profit Hospitals in the US.  The healthcare industry in the US is a highly lucrative sector, owing to the high demand for healthcare services, a large and aging population, advanced medical technology, and a complex insurance system. This, along with the high prices of medical procedures and medications, contributes to the profitability of the healthcare industry in the US. Apart from the financially rewarding compensation offered to doctors and nurses, jobs in healthcare are among the most respected professions in the world.The US healthcare sector also encompasses a diverse range of healthcare providers, including for-profit hospitals. Out of the total 6,129 hospitals in the US, 1,235 are investor-owned/for-profit, making them significantly popular. While the majority of hospitals in the country are nonprofit or government-owned, for-profit hospitals still play a significant role in the healthcare system, especially in terms of ownership and management of healthcare facilities.Which States Have the Most For-Profit Hospitals in the US?According to research, Nevada leads with 54.3% of its hospitals being for-profit, followed closely by Texas, at 51.8%. For-profit hospitals in Florida took the third spot with 48.1%, while New Mexico follows closely behind at 42.9%.Interestingly, according to another research conducted by NiceRX Health, New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, is the most profitable hospital in the US. It has 862 staffed beds and $5.73 billion in net patient revenue. Although the hospital is not for profit, it generates significant income.It is not a surprise that nonprofit hospitals can be profitable sometimes even more than for-profit hospitals. This is because they are entitled to tax-exempt status, which reduces their operating expenses. They can also benefit from tax-free contributions from donors and access tax-free bonds for capital projects, enabling them to allocate more resources towards patient care and investments in healthcare services and infrastructure.Story continuesThe Mayo Clinic Health System topped our ranking of the Best Hospitals in the US, owing to the exceptional team of world-class specialists with unparalleled care. It is also a nonprofit hospital.Emerging Trends in Healthcare in 2023Decision-Making is EvolvingChief population health officers (CPHO) and chief information officers (CIO) are now playing a larger role in procurement and capital expenditure decisions. MedTech companies are, therefore, expected to offer solutions that streamline tasks, provide integrated caregiver support tools, and deliver actionable insights from patient and workflow data.Expanding Care Outside HospitalsOver 180 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, and many hospitals are seeking revenue streams by adopting telehealth services and increasing outpatient procedures at ambulatory centers. ""Hospital-at-home"" care is becoming more prevalent due to remote patient monitoring and connected care advancements, benefiting both patients and hospitals.Moreover, a report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform has warned that more than 200 rural hospitals in the United States are at immediate risk of closure due to financial difficulties. Over 600 rural hospitals, nearly 30% of such hospitals nationwide, are at risk of closing in the near future. The COVID-19 pandemic provided temporary relief through federal grants, but now that assistance has ended, the financial crisis for rural hospitals is looming larger than ever. Rising healthcare costs, workforce shortages, and low patient volumes have contributed fairly to their struggles.Increasing Focus on Cyber SecurityThe rise in cyber security attacks on electronic health records (EHRs) and medical devices has necessitated an increased investment in IT infrastructure. Hospitals are expected to establish network and cloud security measures, protect devices from malicious activity, and develop training programs and incident response plans. MedTech companies, therefore, need to incorporate security capabilities into their innovations and contribute to a shared system for cataloging vulnerabilities.Expanding Virtualization and Machine LearningAI and augmented reality technologies are being considered for immersive and engaging experiences. Augmented reality can facilitate troubleshooting and support for devices, reducing downtime and costs. It also enables virtual product and procedure trainings, making medical training more accessible without travel.The FDA issued guidance on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in medical devices in December 2022. As these technologies become more common, augmented reality is gaining recognition as a cost-effective and time-efficient initial approach.With further ado, let's move on to the list of the most profitable hospitals in America.25 Best For-Profit Hospitals in the USMethodologyIn order to determine the rankings of the best for-profit hospitals in America, a comprehensive methodology was employed. We picked the profitability of the hospitals as a core quality to define ‘best’. The idea is that a financially successful hospital indicates efficient management, excellent patient care, and a sustainable healthcare system. By prioritizing profitability, these hospitals can consistently invest in state-of-the-art technology, attract top talent, and ultimately deliver incredible healthcare services to their patients.Hence, the first step involved considering the income-revenue ratio of the company that owns each hospital. Given that most companies possess multiple hospitals, the focus was placed on identifying the hospital companies with the highest revenues.Subsequently, the identified hospitals of companies were subjected to further evaluation based on their net patient revenue. This additional criterion allowed for fine-tuning of the rankings, ensuring the list's accuracy and robustness.For accurate and up-to-date data on the annual revenue and net incomes of parent companies, we referred to the official websites of the respective companies.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cisco Systems is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$15b ÷ (US$98b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.9% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceIn the above chart we have measured Cisco Systems' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cisco Systems.The Trend Of ROCECisco Systems is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 44% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.In Conclusion...To bring it all together, Cisco Systems has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Considering the stock has delivered 40% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.Story continuesOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation.
