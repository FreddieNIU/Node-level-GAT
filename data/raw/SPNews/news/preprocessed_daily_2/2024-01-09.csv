Japan is a seismically active region with most earthquakes occurring off the east coast, where the Pacific plate subducts beneath Japan. This earthquake occurred on the west coast of Japan, where crustal deformation created by the broader plate motions is accommodated in shallow faults.', 'According to Verisk, shallow earthquakes cause more damage than intermediate- and deep-focus ones since the energy generated by shallow events is released closer to the surface and therefore produces stronger shaking relative to earthquakes located deeper within the Earth. This coastal earthquake produced strong shaking on land and generated a tsunami.', 'The USGS has also noted that while earthquakes are common in Japan, the region surrounding the Noto Peninsula earthquake sees lower rates of seismicity as compared to the major subduction zone along its east coast. Still, since 1900, 30 other M6 and larger earthquakes have occurred within 250 km of the January 1 event.', 'Hazard and Damage Observations\xa0', 'The Noto Peninsula earthquake caused damage across an extensive area around and south of the epicenter. While most of heavy damage occurred in Ishikawa prefecture and in particular Wajima city including a large fire, damage from ground shaking and liquefaction was observed in other prefectures such as Niigata and Toyama. Tsunami waves of over one meter inundated many buildings along the shore, especially in Wajima, Suzu, and Noto.', 'Building codes in Japan are among the most advanced in the world and have been adopted and practiced well since 1981. In the areas impacted by 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake, seismic code requirements are higher than those in the southern part of Japan.', 'Verisk’s modeled insured loss estimates do not consider:', 'Losses to uninsured properties', 'Losses to land', 'Losses to infrastructure', 'Losses to automobiles', 'Business interruption losses, both direct and indirect', 'Workers’ compensation losses', 'Losses to civil engineering (railway) risks, marine cargo and marine hull risks, aviation risks', 'Risks, Transit warehouse risks, movable all risk, and personal accident risks', 'Loss adjustment expenses', 'Losses from non-modeled perils, such as landslide', 'Demand surge: the increase in costs of materials, services, and labor due to increased demand following a catastrophic event', '###', 'About Verisk\xa0 Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) is a leading strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry.

Here's why these three out-of-favor stocks are worth doubling down on now, before investors start to realize the opportunity they present."", 'Medtronic is one of the largest medical device makers on the planet. It operates in the cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical-surgical, and diabetes areas of the healthcare sector. Right now the stock is yielding a historically high 3.2%, suggesting that the shares are on sale. The dividend has been increased annually for 46 consecutive years, however, so this is no fly-by-night company, and it has proved that it places a high priority on returning value to shareholders through dividends.', ""But why is the dividend yield so high? The simple answer is that Medtronic has been having trouble getting new products over the finish line with regulators. If a product doesn't get approved, all of the money spent on research and development is effectively wasted. However, the backlog of products needing approval is working through the system and with positive outcomes. That's good, but now investors are worried about the impact that mass adoption of new weight-loss drugs might have on Medtronic's business. The company believes the fear is overblown, and investors with a long-term view should probably give management the benefit of the doubt on this one, focusing instead on the success with approvals. Although the current fiscal year might not be the best for Medtronic, the long-term future still looks pretty bright."", ""Texas Instruments makes microchips, which are highly cyclical products. The overall industry is currently in a downturn, so investors have shunned the stock just as they have most of the company's peers (AI chip makers are an exception, as this niche has attracted intense investor demand). Texas Instruments' dividend yield today is historically high at around 3.1% -- only this isn't your typical chip stock."", ""For starters, Texas Instruments has increased its dividend annually for two decades, which shows an incredible dedication to investors within an often volatile industry. Second, the company makes relatively simple products that have long shelf lives and go into just about every digital product. (To give you an idea, the company has more than 100,000 customers. In a world that's getting increasingly digital, it seems far more likely that demand goes up than down over the long term."", ""That's why it's so odd that investors are upset by Texas Instruments' capital spending plans right now. Essentially, the fear is that management is spending a lot of money on building additional production capacity during an industry downturn, but that spending will set the company up to exit the downturn a bigger and better competitor. Long-term investors should probably find management's countercyclical approach appealing."", ""Industrial company Stanley Black & Decker is probably the most aggressive name here, given that it's a turnaround situation. The toolmaker got itself into trouble thanks to a series of debt-funded acquisitions that left it overleveraged just as it had to deal with inflation and supply-chain disruptions around the coronavirus pandemic. Management has been trimming debt with asset sales, cost cuts, and attempts to better manage inventory levels. But adjusted earnings have dropped sharply, going from a record $10.48 in 2021 to an expected range of $1.10 to $1.40 per share in 2023. That's an ugly nosedive, and investors have punished the stock accordingly, pushing the yield up to a historically high 3.3%."", ""But management is starting to make some tangible headway. Leverage has been reduced, margin has been improving, and the company is expecting adjusted earnings to rebound strongly in 2024. As the company started its turnaround effort, it projected that earnings in 2024 could end up falling between $4 and $5 a share. Although it hasn't given 2024 guidance just yet, management confirmed to analysts during its third-quarter conference call that this range still seems reasonable. Given how weak earnings are going to be in 2023, even the low end of that range would mean a huge earnings improvement. Investors will probably change their view of Stanley Black & Decker if it can pull off this earnings rebound. Still, this Dividend King is the riskiest of the three options here, and it's probably most suitable for more aggressive investors."", ""Stocks don't end up with historically high yields for no reason, it usually means something is wrong. The question is whether that something is temporary or long-lasting. For Medtronic, Texas Instruments, and Stanley Black & Decker, it seems likely that the problems they're dealing with will pass, given enough time. If you share that view, then these historically reliable dividend stocks might just be worth doubling down on while Wall Street is still so negative on their respective outlooks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Texas Instruments right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Texas Instruments wasn't one of them.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the reader\'s overall understanding of the Company\'s current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items for amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, loss on sale of business, and special charges associated with continued efforts to streamline the organization and integrate recent acquisitions.', 'We also provide “free cash flow"" (“FCF”) to enhance the reader’s understanding of the Company’s ability to generate additional cash from its business.', 'Management typically adjusts for these items for internal reviews of performance and uses the above non-GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision making, and other activities. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the Company’s results of operations as well as comparability with many of its peers, especially those companies focused more on technology and software. Non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.', 'The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin for total company and by segment are “operating profit” and “operating profit margin,” respectively, for total company and by segment, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, and special charges. Adjusted operating profit margin is adjusted operating profit divided by net sales for total company and by segment. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are “net income” and “diluted EPS,” respectively, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, loss on sale of business, share-based payment expense, and special charges. Adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, special charges, and miscellaneous (income) expense, net. A reconciliation of each measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in this news release.', 'The Company defines FCF as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. A calculation of this measure is available in this news release.', 'The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items.', 'Forward-Looking Information', 'This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”).

CF and ICL Group Ltd ICL.', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2206027/2-fertilizer-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-headwinds', 'The Zacks Fertilizers industry is hamstrung by weaker fertilizer prices on demand softness as growers have reduced application rates due to affordability issues. An uptick in the cost of key raw materials partly due to the Russia-Ukraine war has also put pressure on the margins of companies in this space.', 'However, favorable global agricultural fundamentals and healthy farm economics augur well for the industry. Fertilizer players such as CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and ICL Group Ltd are worth a look, notwithstanding the near-term headwinds.', 'The Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield.', 'Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and boost the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population drives the consumption of fertilizers.', 'Weaker Fertilizer Prices to Hurt Margins: Fertilizer prices surged to historic high levels in the first half of 2022, riding on the impacts of the war in Ukraine that led grain prices shooting to record levels and export curtailments in China to meet domestic demand. Disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus also contributed to the spike.', 'However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of the year from their peak levels due to the weakening of demand. Escalating costs led to growers reducing fertilizer applications or switching to less fertilizer-intensive crops, leading to demand destruction. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023.', 'Higher global supply driven by increased global operating rates has resulted in a decline in prices. While fertilizer prices have stabilized somewhat, weaker year-over-year prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.', 'High Input Costs a Concern: A spike in key raw material prices poses a headwind to the companies in this space. Prices of both sulfur and ammonia — key inputs for the production of phosphate — remain elevated. Plant shutdowns and maintenance have led to a tight supply of these raw materials, which, coupled with strong demand, has pushed up their prices. As such, fertilizer makers are likely to face short-term margin pressure associated with higher input costs.', 'Agricultural Fundamentals Remain Favorable: While the coronavirus pandemic stung a vast spectrum of industries, agriculture was relatively unscathed, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. Moreover, strong global demand coupled with supply constraints boosted crop commodity prices. Higher freight, energy and labor costs and raw material shortages contributed to the upside.', ""Prices of corn, soybean and wheat rallied to multi-year highs last year, partly driven by supply worries stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and are likely to remain elevated due to lingering concerns over the war. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand. Expectations of high levels of planted corn and soybean acres globally also suggest a pickup in fertilizer demand."", 'The Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #246, which places it in the bottom 2% of more than 250 Zacks industries.', ""The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term.

CF remains committed to boosting shareholders' value by leveraging strong cash flows."", ""CF Industries currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company's commitment to exceeding customer expectations underpins its business strategy, aiming for long-term shareholder value maximization."", ""Market Leadership and Revenue Growth: Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS) has cemented its position as a market leader in the uniform rental and facility services sector. The company's recent financials indicate a robust 9.3% increase in total revenue, with organic growth rates impressively reaching 9.0%. This growth is a testament to Cintas' ability to attract new business and deepen its penetration into existing customer bases. The strategic expansion into new market segments and the introduction of additional products and services have been pivotal in driving this upward trajectory. Moreover, the company's financial health is further bolstered by its prudent management of operating costs, which has resulted in a 7.4% increase in cost of uniform rental and facility services, significantly lower than the revenue growth rate."", ""Strong Brand and Customer Relationships: The strength of Cintas Corp's brand is reflected in its extensive customer reach, serving over one million businesses across North America. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and reliability, which has fostered a loyal customer base. Cintas' service model, characterized by frequent customer contact, has enabled the development of close personal relationships, providing a competitive edge. These strong relationships not only contribute to customer retention but also facilitate cross-selling opportunities, allowing Cintas to introduce new offerings effectively."", ""Legal Contingencies and Market Risks: Despite its strong market position, Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS) faces potential weaknesses in the form of legal contingencies and market risks. The company is involved in various legal proceedings, including a class action lawsuit alleging contract breaches and ERISA violations. While an agreement in principle has been reached in one case, the outcome of these legal matters could potentially result in material liabilities. Additionally, Cintas' exposure to foreign currency risk, particularly the Canadian dollar, could impact financial results. The company's ability to manage these risks is crucial to maintaining its financial stability and reputation."", ""Dependence on Economic Conditions: Cintas Corp's performance is closely tied to the economic health of the industries it serves. An economic downturn could lead to reduced spending by customers, impacting Cintas' revenue streams. The company's dependence on the uniform rental and facility services sector makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in customer demand, which could be exacerbated by broader economic challenges. This reliance underscores the need for Cintas to diversify its revenue sources and enhance its resilience against economic cycles."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Geographic Expansion: Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS) is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion. The company's recent acquisitions have already contributed positively to revenue growth, and continued pursuit of such opportunities can further enhance its market presence. Cintas' broad range of products and services allows it to target various business prospects across different market segments, providing ample room for expansion. Additionally, the company's strategy to broaden its customer base through geographic expansion, particularly in untapped markets, presents significant potential for revenue diversification and increased market share."", ""Innovation and Product Development: The opportunity for Cintas Corp to innovate and develop new products and services is substantial. The company's frequent customer interactions provide valuable insights into evolving customer needs, enabling Cintas to tailor its offerings accordingly. By leveraging its strong distribution system and customer relationships, Cintas can introduce innovative solutions that address emerging trends in workplace safety, hygiene, and corporate identity. This focus on innovation can drive long-term growth and strengthen Cintas' competitive position in the market."", 'Competitive Pressure and Customer Retention: Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS) operates in a highly competitive industry, where maintaining market share and customer retention is challenging. Competitors may offer similar products and services at lower prices or with additional features, putting pressure on Cintas to continuously enhance its value proposition. The company must remain vigilant in monitoring competitive dynamics and adapting its strategies to maintain its leadership position. Customer retention efforts are critical, as the loss of key accounts could significantly impact revenue and profitability.', ""Economic Sensitivity and Regulatory Changes: The demand for Cintas Corp's services is sensitive to economic conditions. An economic downturn could lead to budget cuts by businesses, reducing the demand for uniform rental and facility services. Additionally, regulatory changes, such as those affecting employment or environmental standards, could impose new compliance costs or operational constraints on Cintas. Staying ahead of regulatory developments and preparing for economic fluctuations are essential for mitigating these threats."", ""In conclusion, Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS) exhibits a strong financial foundation with significant growth potential. The company's market leadership, robust revenue growth, and strategic expansion initiatives position it favorably in the competitive landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

I pay particular attention to what the team at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) puts out, namely their Conviction Buy List. The January update, published just a few days ago, reveals some newcomers, but also a handful of stocks that have remained on the list for several months. Cintas Corp. (NASDAQ:CTAS) is not a sexy tech company, but its share price performance over the last year has been stellar while its earnings per share growth trajectory is impressive.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with HUBS.', ""While Goldman sees higher prices ahead, I take a different view. I see shares as fairly valued despite the company's healthy earnings per share growth outlook. What's more, the domestic employment situation is particularly important."", 'For background, Cintas is the industry leader in corporate uniform rentals across North America. The company also provides restroom cleaning supplies, including mats, first aid kits and other safety products, along with fire protection products.', 'What makes the company strong from a profit perspective is that it operates through a recurring route-based service program. In 2022, the company generated $7.8 billion in total revenue through its 400-plus facilities across the U.S. and Canada, according to Bank of America Global Research.', 'With a $61 billion market cap, the Ohio-based diversified support services company within the industrials sector trades at a high 41.3 forward 12-month non-GAAP pric-earnings ratio and pays a low 0.9% forward dividend yield as of Jan. 2. While earnings are not due out until March, shares trade with a low 15% implied volatility percentage. Short interest on the stock is modest at just 1.7%.', 'In December, Cintas reported a strong second-quarter GAAP earnings beat. Earnings per share verified at $3.61, topping estimates by 13 cents, while revenue of $2.4 billion, up more than 9% from year-ago levels, was about in line with the Wall Street consensus. What was particularly bullish was the management team raised its full-year earnings guidance from a midpoint of $14.23 to $14.50 on a diluted basis. The stock reacted very positively, rising to fresh all-time highs.', 'Cintas has not missed on earnings in at least three years and there have already been a slew of analyst upgrades of the company since the last report. Bulls can also point to margin expansion along with top-line growth, a recipe for big profits. The company expects continued growth in the First Aid & Safety and Fire Protection Services segments, too.', 'Compared to its peers, Cintas features a premium valuation, but is also among the best earnings growth trajectories. Additionally, its profitability metrics are best in class while share price momentum is very high based on technical factors. Finally, its earnings revisions are relatively healthy given its earnings per share beat rate history.', 'Key risks for Cintas include its exposure to the broad economy sales are dependent on a strong labor market with increased capital investments from other industries. Acquisition risk may also be significant as Cintas expands its presence. With elevated operating leverage, any company-specific issues could result in a substantial bottom-line impact.', 'On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings rising nearly 14% in the current fiscal year (2024) with continued double-digit earnings per share growth through 2025 and 2026. The current consensus estimate calls for more than $16 in operating per-share profits next year and $17.59 in 2026. Sales growth is forecast to be less stellar, with revenue rising between 7% and 9% over the out years. Dividends, meanwhile, are expected to climb at a sharp pace over the coming quarters as the company is free cash flow positive, though I am not all that impressed by its current free cash flow yield.', 'Cintas trades more than twice its sector median non-GAAP forward price-earnings ratio. Moreover, the stock is about 20% above its five-year average earnings multiple. In this case, if we take a PEG ratio approach, then we also find that the stock is no bargain even when incorporating the strong profitability trends. If we assign a high 3 PEG, then here is how the valuation looks: A 12% normalized earnings per share growth rate would mean a price-earnings ratio of 36. Assuming $16 of earnings per share on a 36 multiple, then the stock should be near $576, making Cintas mildly overvalued today.', 'Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed third-quarter 2024 earnings date of Wednesday, March 27. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.', ""While I assert Cintas is a bit overvalued fundamentally, it is hard to argue with the strength of the stock's powerful long-term uptrend. Notice in the chart below that the stock has rallied from under $350 in the middle of 2022 to above $600 toward the end of last year. Following a strong response to a solid second-quarter 2024 earnings report, shares surged from the mid-$500s on elevated volume and a burst in the relative strength index momentum oscillator. With the stock pulling back, there is the risk that December's cheery advance was a blow-off top, but more time and price action confirmation is needed before we can make that call."", 'Take a look at the overall pattern from late 2021 through mid-2023. There was a bullish cup and handle pattern with a base at $344 and a resistance line near $460. We can come to a price target based on the breakout - $465 less $344 equals $121. Add that difference to the $465 breakout point, and we get a target near $585. The stock jumped above that target, but the point is the upside move has been made and I would expect at least a pause here. With the stock stretched about 20% above its rising 200-day moving average and a possible negative RSI divergence, there are signs that a pullback may be just getting started.', 'Overall, Cintas has been in a strong uptrend, but there are signs that a pause in its bull run could be underway. The $518 to $525 is possible support and would mark a decent spot to eye a long position.', 'Cintas has robust earnings momentum and its general price trend has been powerful. Still, I see the company near to slightly above fair value.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

This year is likely to bring up the same challenges—and some new ones as well.', 'We reached out to HR executives from more than 10 companies, including Walmart, WM, and Estée Lauder, to share their New Year’s resolutions with Fortune. Their work aspirations cross a wide array of issues, including AI, employee well being, and how to support frontline managers. Here’s what they had to say about their intentions for 2024.', 'These responses have been edited for length and clarity.', ""My New Year's resolution is to bring more joy and energy into the workplace. The last several years have been heavy—from the pandemic to recent global events—and reminders of how meaningful our work is help make the daily experience a positive one. This includes continuing to support and encourage our people so they feel empowered to bring their full selves to work—good days and bad—and ensure they feel seen and valued. So much of our time is dedicated to our work—we should all feel supported and inspired here."", 'In 2024, I am focused on WM’s people-first strategy in an increasingly competitive talent market for frontline and corporate employees, which contemplates a wide range of market shifts and serves to build a sustainable talent engine and equip the organization for the future.', ""This year, we will look to attract and retain talent by enabling a competency-based talent structure through our learning and development programs that will inform the organization's succession needs. We are also continuing to invest in areas like flexible work and digital assets that enable employee efficiency. And, we will cultivate a culture of belonging by providing benefits that meet the needs of our team while recognizing our folks in meaningful ways."", 'My 2024 resolution is to work with our CTO and business leaders to build an AI-focused team with the necessary talent to help the company execute our AI strategy and roadmap. In addition to this, I will continue to focus on succession planning, including ensuring that all very senior roles have two identified successors and all successors have a development plan. Lastly, in 2024 I would like to leverage Prologis’ in-house version of ChatGPT to answer all emails and give me more time to think and plan!', 'In 2024, I, along with many other CHROs, am doubling down on prioritizing transformation, mental well-being, GenAI, skills, and DEI. Beyond sustaining the growth and progress we made in these areas in 2023, my New Year’s resolution is to help scale and evolve our business—and that requires a relentless focus on people and technology.', 'At The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC), we believe in the practice of leadership from every chair and encourage the concept of reverse mentorship where senior leaders learn from emerging talent. In 2024, I’m personally committed to continue learning from the next generation of leaders at ELC and fostering our culture of high-performance leadership across all levels.', 'My biggest resolution for this new year is: Dedicate time to reflecting on this central question—“What will make a positive impact in someone’s life TODAY?” Disruption has become the normal—one’s needs can change so quickly, which requires both people and businesses to build higher levels of resilience. To remain competitive for the best talent, a company’s leaders should be constantly thinking about what will help employees bring their full and best selves to work, even in very busy, hectic times.', 'My New Year’s resolution for 2024 is to encourage better support for frontline and middle managers. The squeeze on managers is real, and 2024 is the opportunity to reverse this and realize the valuable contributions frontline and middle managers make to a company’s ecosystem and performance. Implementing practices to empower and support the success of frontline and middle managers with sufficient levers for them to work smarter and navigate complex problems effectively will pay off with engaged employees who connect into and feel accountable for the company strategy.', 'There are four areas top of mind for me in the new year. 1) Digital. We want to continue to equip our associates with the digital skills to embrace technology, including GenAI, so associates can spend more time focused on our customers, members and fellow associates. 2) Growth. We provide unparalleled opportunities to learn news skills through on-the-job learning, and via our Walmart Academy and our Live Better U education program—this will continue. 3) Associate well-being. We’ll continue to invest in the physical, financial and emotional well-being of our associates so they’re at their best personally and professionally. 4) Belonging. We’ll continue strengthening our culture of belonging so every associate feels valued and celebrated for who they are.', 'Expand my knowledge of and experience with various AI offerings/options—from automation to generative. Especially interested in how we can use AI to free up HR, managers, and employees to focus on more value-add activities and improve employee experience, and how we can use it to support our mail and parcel sortation employees who speak many different languages to obtain personalized information in their native language. Other goals include to further incorporate learning into HR offerings and organization design, and to expand the use of metrics and data to drive my decision making.', 'To help our employees reach their own 2024 goals. When I think about New Year’s resolutions, it’s less about one specific goal that I am setting as CHRO, and more about what our employees aim to do, professionally and personally in 2024, and how we’re helping them achieve that—whether those resolutions are related to their financial, physical or emotional health. They could have their sights set on gaining a new skill, earning a degree, getting healthier, starting a family or saving for retirement—and those are all examples of things that we support as part of our commitment to being a great place to work.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

And what you’re seeing is a number of those oil tankers no longer traversing the Red Sea.”', 'Sommers, who runs a powerful oil-and-gas trade group whose members include ExxonMobil, Chevron and Hess, also cited the potential for the Israel-Hamas war morphing into a regional conflict that endangers energy supplies.', '“If this situation in the Middle East continues to escalate,” Sommers said, “that will certainly have an effect on price.”', 'Last month, BP halted shipments through the Red Sea, citing a “deteriorating security situation.” Attacks on vessels have only intensified since then, with Houthi rebels launching unmanned surface drones against commercial shipping lanes and US Navy helicopters sinking three Houthi boats and killing those aboard.', 'Bab al-Mandab Strait, a sea route connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea, is a critical passageway for crude oil and fuel. About 8.2 million barrels per day of oil and oil products transited the Red Sea through the strait this year, according to oil research firm Vortexa.', 'Oil executives are working “hand in glove” with the US Navy and other elements of the federal government to “ensure that these attacks stop,” Sommers said.', 'Elsewhere in the Middle East, ISIS claimed responsibility last week for deadly twin blasts in Iran that killed at least 84 people. Violence has also increased in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group.', 'Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told clients late last week that the violence in Lebanon and Iran is unlikely to be the triggers for a regional war.', 'However, the former CIA analyst cautioned: “If the current trends continue it is hard to see how it remains a contained conflict.”', 'Although oil prices have surged at times during the Israel-Hamas war, those spikes have been fleeting. US crude closed at $70.77 a barrel on Monday, about 15% below where it traded before the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.', 'One major reason energy markets have been relatively calm is robust supply from the United States.', '“Oil prices have stabilized right now and it is only because of the American energy revolution,” Sommers said. “American oil and gas producers should be thanked for ensuring that volatility hasn’t gone in an upward direction.”', 'As of the final quarter of 2023, the United States was producing more oil than any country in history. Not only has that US oil offset the loss of OPEC+ barrels taken offline by the producer group, but it has acted as a shock absorber as the security situation in the Middle East devolves.', '“Ten years ago if this same situation was occurring, we’d be dealing with significantly higher oil prices,” he said. “We’re producing more oil than this country ever has and that is a huge advantage to the American consumer and, by the way, to our national security. We don’t have to go and beg, borrow and steal from other countries for energy.”', 'Despite the security jitters about the Middle East, gas prices are 20 cents cheaper today than at this point last year, according to AAA.', 'Some Republicans claim the Biden administration has waged a war on American energy on the regulatory front. That’s despite the record-shattering oil production that has occurred on President Joe Biden’s watch.', 'Sommers voiced significant concerns about Biden’s energy stance, especially a “regulatory onslaught” on drilling on public lands and public waters. He argued most federal production today was made possible by leases approved by prior administrations.', '“If we don’t get the policies right, and if we don’t eliminate this red tape, we’re really sowing the seeds for the next energy crisis,” Sommers said. “This administration has gone backwards on energy policy. You’re not seeing it at the pump right now, but you’re going to see it in the future if we don’t reverse course.”', 'Of course, most US oil production occurs on private land, not federal. And despite Biden’s climate ambitions, US oil production is up sharply since he took office.', 'The White House did not respond to requests for comment.', 'The oil industry is taking its message to the airwaves.', 'The API previewed for CNN a major new ad campaign, called “Lights on Energy,” launching on Tuesday ahead of the group’s State of American Energy event.', 'The ad blitz will cost eight figures and air on national TV as well as on digital platforms, seeking to convince voters and lawmakers that oil and natural gas are “vital to our energy future.” It will target the Beltway audience as well as key states.', '“We will work to dismantle policy threats and empower voters and policymakers with facts,” Sommers said. “Renewable sources have a role to play, but oil and natural gas will be needed for decades.”', 'In response, advocacy group Climate Power said polls show Americans support speeding up the transition to clean and renewable energy.', '“It’s no surprise that API is spending their money trying to hold back progress,” Alex Witt, Climate Power’s senior advisor of oil and gas, said in a statement. “Big oil and gas has bought the support of Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress, but they can’t buy American voters.”', 'Climate Power has launched an $80 million campaign to tout Biden’s environmental record, including advertising, digital messaging, an influencer program and targeted outreach to Latino voters.', 'Meanwhile, climate scientists continue to warn the world needs less, not more, fossil fuels to save the planet.', 'A UN report in November found that global fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than double the levels consistent with meeting the 2015 Paris climate agreement goals.', 'Research released last year concluded that oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is creating significantly higher levels of planet-warming gas than previously thought — finding the climate impact is twice that of official estimates.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Operating as a triple net lease landlord therefore helps Realty Income ensure a stable and predictable cash flow for itself and its investors. For tenants, the net lease model offers more freedom to make alterations or customize a space to suit the needs of the business.', ""There's no exact formula for estimating the value of a triple net lease, but industry experts estimate it to be worth approximately $3 per square foot on average, though it can vary substantially depending on the location, the property, and the business."", 'As of the end of the third quarter, Realty Income had 262.6 million square feet of leasable space, which equals approximately $800 million in annual revenue assuming $3/square foot.', 'That revenue is represented in its annual base rent, which is currently $3.9 billion, meaning about 20% comes from the three net lease components based on the $3/square foot benchmark.', ""Realty Income's triple-net-lease strategy is a key reason for the stock's long-term success as is its focus on non-discretionary, low-price point and service-oriented businesses."", 'The company owns more than 13,000 properties, and among its biggest tenants are Walgreens, Dollar General, Dollar Tree/Family Dollar, and 7-Eleven.', ""Since its IPO in 1994, Realty Income has a total return compound annual growth rate of 13.4%, which compares with roughly 9% for the S&P 500. Realty Income has also achieved that performance with less risk than the broad market as it has a beta of 0.5, meaning it's only half as volatile as the S&P 500. In fact, the company's total shareholder return since 1994 has had the fifth-lowest downside of all S&P 500 constituents."", 'While Realty Income is known more as a dividend stock than a growth stock, the company has an attractive growth opportunity as it sees a $12 trillion global net lease addressable market and it sourced $95 billion in acquisition opportunities in 2022.', ""It also acquired Spirit Realty Income in October in a transaction valued at $9.3 billion. Spirit gives it a complementary real estate portfolio and annualized growth in adjusted funds from operations of more than 2.5%. The deal shows Realty's ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions in addition to its regular real estate operations."", ""Realty Income's triple-net-lease approach gives the company a strategic advantage while reducing risk and delivering excellent long-term returns.

Not only has that US oil offset the loss of OPEC+ barrels taken offline by the producer group, but it has acted as a shock absorber as the security situation in the Middle East devolves.', '“Ten years ago if this same situation was occurring, we’d be dealing with significantly higher oil prices,” he said. “We’re producing more oil than this country ever has and that is a huge advantage to the American consumer and, by the way, to our national security.

The company's products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. Merck is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line.

The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation.

With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.

Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $194.68, but it is currently trading at US$143 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Ralph Lauren’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future.

Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.

However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Motorola Solutions' earnings history below.

When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation.

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tumbled 19% in 2022, dragged down by runaway inflation, rapid interest rate hikes, and recession fears. That was its worst annual performance since the global financial crisis in 2008.', 'Yet, the recession many economists predicted for 2023 never materialized, and the S&P 500 rebounded 24% during the year, propelled higher by cooling inflation, excitement around artificial intelligence, and the anticipation of rate cuts. The benchmark index ended the year with nine consecutive weeks of gains, its longest win streak since 2004.', 'The stage is now set for another exciting year. Here are three not-so-wild stock market predictions for 2024.', 'My first prediction is the S&P 500 will increase by 10% in 2024, a more modest performance than its 24% gain in 2023 but a good year nonetheless. I base that prediction on two pieces of information.', 'First, Wall Street analysts expect S&P 500 revenue and earnings growth to accelerate in 2024. That could energize investors and move the index higher. Indeed, analysts believe that will happen. The S&P 500 has a median 12-month price target of 5,090,\xa0which implies about 8% upside from its current level.', 'Second, the Federal Reserve has hinted that its rate-hiking campaign is finished, and its latest projections imply three 25-basis-point cuts in 2024. Lower rates boost spending and economic growth, and investors tend to get excited by those prospects. As a result, the S&P 500 returned an average of 17.6% during the 12-month period following the last six hike cycles, according to JPMorgan Chase.', 'To add context, the Federal Reserve last raised its benchmark rate in July 2023, and since then, the S&P 500 has advanced 3.6%. That leaves potential upside of 14% through July 2024.', ""Between the 8% upside based on the analysts' median target price and the 14% upside implied by the end of the Fed rate hikes, I chose 10% specifically because it aligns with the average annual return of the S&P 500 for the last 30 years.\xa0In other words, I expect the S&P 500 to have an average year."", 'My second prediction is the technology sector will outperform the broader S&P 500, propelled higher by strong momentum across artificial intelligence (AI)\xa0and cybersecurity stocks. I base that prediction on three pieces of information.', 'First, the technology sector was the best-performing of all 11 market sectors over the last year, the last five years, and the last decade. In fact, the technology sector increased 465% over the last 10 years, nearly tripling the 160% return of the second-best-performing sector (consumer discretionary), as shown in the chart below.', 'The technology sector has also outperformed the S&P 500 in nine of the last 10 years,\xa0meaning recent history implies a 90% chance that the technology sector will beat the market once again in 2024.', 'Second, a recent survey from Morgan Stanley found that AI was the second-largest IT budget priority in the third quarter of 2023, up from third in the second quarter. That trend will likely gain momentum in 2024. Experts like Microsoft founder Bill Gates and veteran analyst Dan Ives see AI as the most revolutionary technology in decades, and the AI market is forecasted to grow at 37% annually through 2030.', 'Third, the same Morgan Stanley survey identified cybersecurity as the largest IT budget priority in the third quarter of 2023, up from No. 2 in the second quarter. Digital transformation projects are driving cloud migration and connected device proliferation, making cybersecurity increasingly imperative. That trend is poised to gain momentum in 2024, given the upcoming presidential election.\xa0The market is forecasted to grow at 12.3% annually through 2030.', 'Companies that blend both elements could see their share prices soar in 2024 and beyond. One that comes to mind is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a recognized market leader in endpoint security, cloud security, and threat intelligence. And that success is due in part to superior AI.', 'Indeed, consultancy Frost & Sullivan recently wrote, ""CrowdStrike leads the industry with regards to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to endpoint security, as well as providing unparalleled prevention of malware and malware-free attacks.""', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is worth $2.8 trillion as of this writing, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is worth $2.7 trillion.\xa0Both businesses have been wildly successful during the past decade, but my third prediction is that Microsoft will surpass Apple as the most valuable public company by the end of 2024. Here's why."", 'Apple is a wonderful business. It is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and its installed base of more than 2 billion devices is driving strong growth in its high-margin services segment. But the stock appears overvalued. Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings at 9.1% over the next three to five years, and the stock currently trades at 29.6 times earnings. That gives it a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 3.2, well above the five-year average of 2.3.', 'Meanwhile, Microsoft has more robust growth prospects. It is the market leader in enterprise software and operates the second-largest\xa0cloud computing platform. Better yet, Microsoft is leaning into generative AI across both business segments, tapping into explosive demand.', 'To that end, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings at 14.6% annually over the long term. Compared to its current valuation of 35.6 times earnings, that gives it a cheaper PEG ratio of 2.4, and that multiple is identical to the five-year average.', 'To be clear, I predict the market will reassess its valuation of both companies such that Microsoft lands on top. That does not necessarily mean Apple will lose value.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?', 'Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and S&P 500 Index wasn't one of them.

But in reality, many games are simultaneously played in the same arena."", 'Income investing is a unique way of being involved in the stock market. Instead of using capital gains (buying a stock and selling it for a higher price) as the primary driver of returns, the focus is on income from dividends. Income investors may ignore popular stocks in favor of stodgy dividend-paying companies that return most of their earnings directly to investors.', ""However, income investors often make one big mistake. Here's what it is and how to avoid it."", ""If you're not an income investor, you may be wondering why folks do it in the first place. After all, the average annual return of the S&P 500 is around 9% or 10%. So why buy a dividend-paying company with a 5% yield?"", 'The primary reason is that income investors are risk-averse or focus more on capital preservation than capital appreciation. The S&P 500 has an attractive average return. But it can do just about anything in the short term.', ""After the financial crisis of 2008, it took the S&P 500 about six years to recover to its previous high, reached in 2007. If you had the patience and conviction to hold through that period, it was worth it. But many investors don't have the time horizon or temperament to do that. It sounds easy in hindsight. But those who have been through bear markets know how difficult it can be to see the light at the end of the tunnel when equity prices are crashing all around you."", ""Quality dividend stocks, like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), have recession-resistant business models and tend to outperform a bear market. They also have over 60 years of consecutive dividend raises. However, they don't have the growth prospects of many smaller companies in other sectors. For that reason, they tend to underperform a strong year in the market, which is exactly what happened in 2023."", 'Unfortunately, investors can pass on quality companies and fall prey to a higher yield. A perfect recent example is what happened last week with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).', ""Walgreens reported its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan. 4. But all eyes were on Walgreens' 48% dividend cut."", ""Prior to the cut, Walgreens had a yield of around 8% -- making it one of the highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 and the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But Walgreens wasn't supporting its dividend with earnings."", ""The biggest mistake income investors make is looking at the size of a company's dividend or how long it's been paying the dividend, instead of looking at how the business is doing and whether it can support future dividend growth. After all, what good is a high yield if the stock's going down and the quality of the underlying business is deteriorating?"", 'Another example is Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). Unlike Walgreens, Costco has been a market darling stock -- a true outperformer and an industry leader. But Costco has a bizarre dividend program. It pays a relatively small ordinary dividend. Then, every few years, once it accumulates enough cash on the balance sheet, it pays an unusually large one-time special dividend.', 'Costco recently announced a $15 per share special dividend. The special dividend ""feels"" great, certainly better than a regularly scheduled ordinary dividend. But it doesn\'t happen all the time, it isn\'t guaranteed, and it\'s uncertain how large it will be.', ""In fact, even when factoring in the special dividend, Costco won't even yield as much as Target in 2024."", ""Again, we have an example of an income opportunity that sounds great at first glance. But in reality, it's a bit misleading."", 'Income investing centers around predictability and is often a way to supplement income in retirement. An unsustainable high yield (Walgreens) or a company that sometimes pays special dividends (Costco) misses that objective.', ""Before approaching a potential income stock, you'll first want to make sure that the business itself is one worth owning. Next, you'll want to look at metrics like the payout ratio, which is the amount of earnings that are being used to pay the dividend. Look at free cash flow, and whether it's high enough to support the dividend."", ""After that, consider whether there are other ways a company returns value to shareholders. In the case of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the dividend yield is only 0.5%. But that's because Apple doesn't focus solely on dividend raises. Instead, it's famous for supporting a massive stock repurchase program, which helps reduce the outstanding share count and makes the stock a better value over time."", ""Extremely risk-averse, income-oriented investors may prefer a company that doesn't do any buybacks and focuses solely on the dividend. There are companies that do that, like pipeline giant Kinder Morgan and its sizable 6.4% yield."", 'But folks who are OK with a lower yield and more investment in the business and the benefits of buybacks may prefer a company like Procter & Gamble, which consistently increases its dividend, buys back a ton of its stock, and has a strong underlying business.', ""When investing in the stock market, it's important to remember that a dividend yield isn't the same as a bond's yield or the return from a risk-free asset like a certificate of deposit. A company is paying that dividend, and the ability to support the dividend is only as good as the company's fundamentals."", 'Over the short term, you could collect more dividend income from a riskier, higher-yielding stock. But this strategy has holes and can collapse in a heartbeat, as we saw with Walgreens.', 'By approaching an investment as a business first and considering the yield second, you can help avoid the misleading allure of high-yield income stocks and likely make a higher return over time.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

But years of dividend raises paired with an underperforming stock price helped propel Walgreens' dividend yield to nearly 10% in late November, when the stock was selling off with no end in sight."", 'At the time, Walgreens was the highest-yielding stock in the Dow and briefly surpassed Altria Group as the highest-yielding stock in the entire S&P 500. That all changed on Jan. 4, when Walgreens announced a 48% dividend cut, reducing the quarterly payout from $0.48 a share to $0.25.', 'In an instant, Walgreens lost its crown as the highest-yielding Dow stock. Today, its forward yield is around just 4%, which is still far higher than the average yield in the S&P 500 or Dow but a far cry from the status it used to enjoy.', ""Let's reflect on how Walgreens got here, why it cut its dividend, and what investors can learn from this to make wise decisions."", 'Over the last 20 years, Walgreens stock is down 30%, even after the recent rally over a month or so. When factoring in dividends, it is only up 12.4% compared to a 528.7% total return in the S&P 500.', 'The following chart is disappointing. Years of dividend raises were wiped away, paired with the backdrop of a poor-performing stock price.', 'Red flags were leading up to this moment. In the early 2000s and even the early 2010s, Walgreens made sizable dividend raises yearly. But over the last five years or so, management was making minimal raises -- just $0.01 or $0.02 per share per quarter (or even less).', ""Companies sometimes make minimal raises to continue their streak of consecutive dividend increases (I'm looking at you, 3M). Walgreens had raised its dividend for 47 consecutive years."", 'Just three more years would have given it the coveted Dividend King status, putting it on an elite list of companies that have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. But labels can be deceiving.', 'Other Dividend Kings, like Procter & Gamble or Illinois Tool Works, use higher earnings to fund dividend raises and are not just raising them to appease investors. And because earnings are growing, the market views both businesses as more valuable, which is why both stocks have done well over the long term.', 'Walgreens tried to achieve the Dividend King distinction by raising its payout despite a languishing business and an underperforming stock price.', ""Walgreens' recent dividend cut reminds investors of a few key lessons. First, a dividend is only as strong as the underlying business. And the ability to sustainably raise dividends over time depends on operational performance, not making the minimal raise to try to achieve a certain distinction."", ""Another lesson is that a high yield doesn't tell the full story. In the case of Walgreens, investors holding the stock for the last 20 years would have underperformed the risk-free rate even when factoring in dividends and missed out on an incredible growth period in the broader market."", ""Many Dividend Kings have a yield of 3% or less. But that's partly because the stock prices of top Dividend Kings go up as much or more than the growth rate of the dividend."", ""For example, Illinois Tool Works' stock is up over 86% in the last five years compared to a 40% increase in the dividend, while P&G is up 48.5% and its dividend is up 26.1%. Because both stock prices are up by more than the dividend has increased, the yield is lower today than it was five years ago."", 'In this vein, viewing the yield in a vacuum is a big mistake because it can overly reward underperforming stocks and punish well-performing stocks. By comparison, Walgreens stock is down by more than 65% in the last five years. And after the recent cut, its dividend is down 43.2%.', ""So ultimately, Walgreens' brief stint with the highest yield in the Dow and the S&P 500 meant very little, as investors would have been better off in cash over the last five years than collecting a dividend from a falling knife like Walgreens."", ""No matter your risk tolerance or investment time horizon, it's important not to pass on an excellent company and instead go for a not-as-good company just because it has a higher yield."", 'Focusing on the business itself -- how it is doing, where it is going, and if future dividend raises are feasible -- is a better use of your time than trying to juice your portfolio with a bit of extra passive income.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

That's a 48% reduction from the $0.48-per-share quarterly payment it was making last year.

Walgreens, is, however, working at slashing costs to improve its financials."", ""Ultimately, a reduction to the dividend looked inevitable for the company given its current challenges. The hope for investors is that as Walgreens' healthcare business grows and it continues to lower its costs, the new dividend will start to look safe again."", ""By making the move to cut the dividend, new CEO Tim Wentworth is showing that Walgreens is serious about improving its cash flow and prioritizing the sustainability of its operations. It is also signaling that it won't allow the company's dividend growth streak (which was getting close to 50 years) to get in the way of that. In the end, the business needs to be in good financial shape. Paying a high dividend should not take precedence over that."", 'In recent years, Walgreens has been investing billions into the rollout of primary care clinics at its locations. Freeing up cash flow from the dividend will allow the company to allocate more resources to that initiative. Annually, Walgreens spends about $1.7 billion on its dividend payments.', ""There may be more cost reductions necessary and a further dividend cut may still be possible, but the good news for investors is that the new CEO is making the moves necessary to improve the company's operations.

I'm here at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. And joining me now is the new CEO of Walgreens, Tim Wentworth. Obviously, a lot to cover here, Tim, but thank you so much for making the time to join us. I know this is your big debut."", 'TIM WENTWORTH: It is.', 'ANJALEE KHEMLANI: [LAUGHS]', ""TIM WENTWORTH: And it's great to be here with you."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Thank you. So let's start talking about Walgreens and what you have planned out. I know we just got done with your first earnings, and we had a little chat then about the strategy you have. But what is it that you see is the story for Walgreens for 2024?"", ""TIM WENTWORTH: Yeah, I think the story for 2024 is pretty straightforward. It's re-energize the retail part of our business, both front and back of the store, in the context of a pretty tough consumer situation, and in the context right now of a fairly soft cough, cold, and flu season, although we're starting to see some of that emerging, as you know, more masks here than I expected to see, for example."", ""But secondly then is, really importantly, get the balance sheet and the cash position of the company squared away. So you saw we cut the dividend, for example. That was a difficult decision but necessary. We have significant capital reductions that we're making without impacting the underlying business in a meaningful way, and cost reductions. So there's that piece of it, but that really frees up the capital then to do the investment, not only in the stores and in additional services in the stores, but importantly, the broader health services portfolio."", ""And what you've seen this year there is, what I would say, getting to profitability. We're recovering almost $400 million of incremental profitability, largely a reduction of losses from a couple of the key assets. And so that's the other piece this year, is not only stabilizing that, but really helping our shareholders as well as the consumer understand, we are not pivoting away from the stores to a health care strategy, which has been somewhat the narrative. Rather, we are starting with great stores and expanding out from there a set of services that we can do across the health care ecosystem for payers."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, talk to me about that, because we know the stock has been down over the past year. You've had a lot of struggles in the retail space, many different factors. And generally speaking, I know at least in my years covering Walgreens, the front of store has always been sort of a weaker, sort of an up and down situation. So how are you trying to change the strategy to address all that?"", ""TIM WENTWORTH: Sure. I talked about everything being on the table. There are a number of elements when you talk about the store. There's how many stores do we have. So if you look at historically, we've closed a couple of thousand stores since the last five years, 200 more this year. And we're looking forward at what the right footprint is for the future."", ""Secondly, the layout of the stores and how much we dedicate to health care versus to other retail activities. Third is the mix and the number of SKUs in the stores. So that's all on the table. I think we can meaningfully reduce the number of SKUs. It means we're going to work with fewer national brands, but we're going to be more important to the ones we work with."", ""And then own label, which to me is way under leveraged compared to the trust we build with our consumers. And being able to get own label, which has been-- it's gone up over the last couple of years, but I'd like to double own label. You can see other retailers that do a good job with own label do quite well, and the consumers find it absolutely acceptable. So those are the pieces."", ""And then, finally, turn the store managers loose. I think the thing that's really exciting is we have 9,000 store managers. And getting them the information and, frankly, rearranging their incentives so that their store and their employee eNPS and their customer eNPS are how they get their variable comp will unleash a whole bunch of innovation, giving them some flexibility to make their stores even more successful."", 'ANJALEE KHEMLANI: A quick yes or no on that. Does that same label-- own label also include getting into the biosimilar space? Are you looking to do that level or no?', ""TIM WENTWORTH: No. We're happy. The manufacturers of biosimilars, we're going to be a great partner for them as those products ultimately find market acceptance. But, no, we're not going to-- I don't think you'll see us building manufacturing capability."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, I'm interested by this retail focus because it seems to be that when you were appointed, people assumed that you might be getting into the insurance space, more vertical integration. But I get the sense that you're not necessarily a fan of vertical integration, of VillageMD, even, and just being a part of that strategy."", ""TIM WENTWORTH: Vertical integration can take a lot of forms and works really well for certain players and has worked well for players. Given where we are, it's not for us the best option compared to building out a health services strategy that is asset light, by and large, highly capital efficient, and enables the touchpoints that we have with 10 million consumers a day to be used as touchpoints for other outcomes that matter in health care. Everybody at this conference would love to have 10 million touchpoints a day with patients, right?"", 'ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Sure.', ""TIM WENTWORTH: And so as we sit down with health plans, they get super excited. So we don't need to own a health plan, frankly, in order to create value for that health plan and be paid fairly for it. That's the same as the PBMs who we do a lot of different services for in some cases. We don't need to own it in order to actually be the most valued and trusted partner."", 'ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So is this something where you would consider cutting VillageMD out of the equation?', ""TIM WENTWORTH: Well, that's-- I've said everything is on the table. So first I have to say everything is on the table. But let me say, actually, VillageMD is performing really well. They clearly needed to do a reset this year, and that's what they're doing very, very, very well. We view them as an investor, because we are an investor in them. We actually hold some of their debt, so we also are their banker. But most importantly, for me, is they are a place for us to build services collaboratively that helps them achieve their goals and that we can then prove out and then help others with as well."", ""So I actually like our relationship with VillageMD, but you will not see us adding to that set of investments with additional provider groups beyond VillageMD, Summit, CityMD. We're very happy that that's-- we have what we need in that respect to build solutions that can be taken out to the marketplace."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, talking about the strategy scripts, of course, and volume is always one of the metrics that are used to judge the company. We've seen a lot of different changes in the past several years thanks to the pandemic-- a lot of digital focus, mail order has gone up. And we just heard one company say that they're going direct to consumer. I'm speaking about Eli Lilly. Going directly to consumer-- do you feel like that strategy bypasses or threatens the pharmacy industry in any way?"", ""TIM WENTWORTH: I mean, a lot of it will depend on how it plays out. But what I would say in a general sense is not necessarily. When I look at the announcement that I know Lilly made-- and there's a lot of details still to be forthcoming, right? And I have a huge amount of respect both for the products they're putting in there as well as the process they're implying. I actually think they'll ultimately conclude they want a retail partner to work with."", ""And so what you'll have-- and if you think about it, it's a very, by and large, right now, a very large cash program. And what we've seen is the cash programs have proliferated because of this kind of historic cross-subsidization of brands and generics, where the generics for a patient in a high-deductible plan were costing them more in their insured benefit than if they just walked in and paid cash. Well, there was a rational reason in the history that was the case. It looks less rational now."", ""And the GOPs are a great example where, quite frankly, it doesn't work for us or, frankly, the ecosystem for us to not be paid at least what they cost for us to acquire plus the services to help those patients. And so I think you're going to see a continued evolution that helps the pharma company get the drug to the patient, have it be safe, have it be taken as it should be. And as you know, that class of drugs, adherence is a major problem. And I think we can demonstrate how we are a much stronger adherence engine, for example, than a mail-order pharmacy."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Fair enough. And then when you're talking about where the company gets to go from here, what the growth strategy looks like-- you're talking about locations and storefronts, brick and mortar, all the changes that you anticipate in the services that are being offered-- what is it that you would say is the key goal, the key focus that Walgreens needs to stay on in order to ensure that the story that has been its story for some time now isn't going to continue forward, that you are able to, in this tough environment, actually get the growth that you're anticipating?"", ""TIM WENTWORTH: Yeah, I think what you'll see-- the kind of metrics that I'm going to be looking at is, how many new contracts have we signed with large payers to do unique things? It's going to be, how many pharma companies are now paying us to actually help recruit for their trials, because we've signed 25 contracts. We have a very large one that we're looking down the barrel of. And these contracts are actually, in some cases, multiyear, double-digit, million-dollar contracts. They are significant."", ""And so, again, what I'm going to be looking for is, ultimately, do the customers in the marketplace-- not the patients, but the customers, the health plans, health systems, PBMs and pharmacies, and the pharma companies. Are we winning with them, and do we have announceable, reportable things that are material to the business and don't require massive amounts of capital in order to bring them to life?"", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, we'll have to leave it there. But thank you so much, Tim Wentworth, new CEO of Walgreens. Thank you for joining us today."", 'TIM WENTWORTH: Thanks, Anjalee, appreciate it.', ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Don't go anywhere. Yahoo Finance Live will be right back.""]"

The company will probably continue to make meaningful dividend raises for years to come. A growing dividend paired with growing earnings provides the momentum needed to justify a higher valuation for Starbucks.', 'It sounds great, but the real question is whether Starbucks has what it takes to meaningfully grow earnings, or if a low-single-digit growth rate should be seen as the new normal.', ""During its Q4 fiscal 2023 earnings call, Starbucks provided crucial fiscal 2024 guidance, including 5% to 7% comparable stores (or comps) growth, as existing stores are expected to boost sales thanks to digital engagement and customer loyalty as Starbucks' master plan takes form."", 'On top of same-store sales growth, Starbucks expects to grow new stores by 7%, with 75% of those new stores coming from outside the U.S. By the end of fiscal 2024 (late September or early October 2024), Starbucks expects to have nearly 41,000 stores globally.

As a percentage of sales, Starbucks Rewards is far more popular in China than in the U.S., which shows a willingness to engage with the Starbucks app and use mobile order and pay."", ""China should continue to make up a larger share of the overall business given Starbucks' strong brand presence in China, the growth of the Chinese economy, and more favorable digital interaction."", ""It's too early to tell the effect Starbucks' investments will have on fiscal 2024 specifically. But overall the company has what it takes to grow over time."", ""Saving the best for last, Starbucks is forecasting 15% to 20% fiscal 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth thanks to sales revenue growth and margin expansion. On the low end of that range, that would mean fiscal 2024 EPS of $4.12 -- far higher than the Street's estimate of $3.74."", ""Based on Starbucks' share price of around $94, that would be good for a forward P/E ratio of 22.8. And given that Starbucks expects revenue growth and margin expansion to continue in the years to come, the stock could continue to look like an even better value if the stock price languishes."", 'Starbucks was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which threw a wrench in its growth trajectory.

But the road wasn’t without some speed bumps.', 'In July 2020, Goldman, a leading underwriter of IPOs, began telling businesses that it wouldn’t take them public in the U.S. or Europe if they didn’t have at least one diverse board member. In 2021, Goldman boosted the requirement to two members, including at least one woman. The investment bank considers gender and race, as well as sexual orientation, in its DEI metrics for board placements. It often found companies needed help with these mandates.', '“What we were seeing was that the supply was there, and demand was increasingly there. It was a market mechanism problem, and the two were not connecting,” Ilana Wolfe, who currently oversees Goldman’s efforts as head of corporate board engagement, recently told Fortune.', 'Goldman’s solution was to establish a board diversity and engagement team, led by Wolfe, to help businesses by leveraging its numerous relationships with companies. Doing so helps find candidates that board placement firms may not consider, Wolfe explained, because some placement firms often rotate through the same list of names—plus they don’t have the networking reach of Goldman.', 'Many of Goldman’s referrals come from CEOs and CFOs with whom they’ve worked, Wolfe added. When a client reaches out for a certain profile, Goldman, often within a day, can produce a subset of its network highlighting individuals who could be a good fit.', '“We are not a search firm,” added Wolfe, explaining that, instead, Goldman will often play matchmaker, likening the firm to “Aunt Sally,” a family member who helps relatives meet someone wonderful, she said. “I am the ‘Aunt Sally’ of the board matchmaking universe.”', 'Goldman’s diversity placement service is free to clients and part of its investment banking offerings. “This is something unique to Goldman. This isn’t a transactional area for service. It’s additive to the long-term relationship,” Wolfe said. While the service started out focused on private companies, public companies also are now using it.', 'A lack of diversity in governance has been cited in the blowups of the cryptocurrency trading firm FTX and Silicon Valley Bank, and it continues to be a big issue on Wall Street. A 2021 report from McKinsey & Co. found that women in North America remained dramatically underrepresented in the financial services workforce, especially at the senior management level and above.', ""Goldman’s board is composed of 13 executives, including five women and three people of color, and the firm's senior management committee, which has 27 members, includes eight women and two members who identify as people of color. (Among the eight women, just two run a revenue-generating business: Stephanie Cohen, global head of Goldman’s platform solutions, and Beth Hammack, co-head of the global financing group.)"", 'The strategy is working for Goldman. Of the more than 100 diverse executives placed at public and private companies, 90% are women and 38% are racially or ethnically diverse, according to Goldman’s website. Wolfe is also benefiting: In November, she was one of 608 executives promoted to managing director.', '“Diversity of all forms leads to diversity of thought and perspective,” Wolfe said, “which is strategically important to effective governance.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

We estimate the metrics to reach $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.', 'Investment Banking (IB) Fees:\xa0Per data compiled by Bloomberg, the merger and acquisition value in 2023 aggregated $2.7 trillion, missing the $3 trillion mark, which is the lowest annual value recorded since 2013. Hence, IB business is likely to have been significantly affected during the year.', 'Nonetheless, global deal-making witnessed a slight rebound in the fourth quarter, and green shoots were observed in capital markets and issuance activities. Notably, at the conference held in early December, bank executives stated that global deal-making conditions have started to improve. The major factor driving a better picture was the stabilizing interest rate environment.', 'Coleman added at the conference, “We did see some major natural resource sector merger deals take place earlier in the fall. Goldman Sachs was on both of those deals, given our merger franchise.” Also, there have been quite a few initial public offerings during the quarter to be reported. These are likely to have positively impacted Goldman’s quarterly IB revenues.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB fees of $1.6 billion indicates a 2.8% growth from the prior quarter’s actuals. We anticipate IB income to be $1.5 billion.', 'Net Interest Income (NII):\xa0Per Fed’s latest data, demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened in the first two months of the quarter under review from the third-quarter 2023 level. Nevertheless, demand for consumer loans as well as commercial and residential real estate loans showed signs of improvement in November from third-quarter 2023 levels. Hence, we believe loan growth for Goldman is likely to have been modest.', 'Also, while Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes during fourth-quarter 2023, interest rates remained at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. Though, such high interest rates are likely to have increased funding costs to some extent, the bank’s decent loan demand during the quarter is expected to have positively impacted NII growth.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.9 billion indicates a 24% increase from the prior quarter’s reported figure. We project NII to be $1.7 billion.', 'Expenses:\xa0Goldman’s investments in technology and market development expenses for business expansion\xa0are anticipated to have led to a rise in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Nonetheless, employee reductions will help it save $600 million and $400 million in payroll and non-compensation expenses, respectively, in 2023.

The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share, indicating a change of -12.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.8%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.32 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $978.33 million indicates a year-over-year change of -8.9%.

The EPS surprise was +4.71%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Hologic is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

Well, you know, the studios have been relying on franchises every year, seagulls. You know, ""Barbie"" was not a seagull, but it was a brand. ""Super Mario Brothers,"" another brand, not a seagull.

And they're certainly very serious about it. They've made big investments, including partnerships with all of the mobile producers out there. So AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, they're signing agreements with them in addition to Dish Network and Comcast because we all see that mobile accounts for roughly half of the gaming revenue right now, it's around 46%. And so they're making the right investments in the right places to try and capture it. Again, it's just all comes down to that adoption rate and the migration of viewers into gamers."", 'It\'s less likely to be happening here domestically just because of the pure brand power that you have of existing games, again, ""Minecraft,"" ""Fortnite,"" ""Madden,"" all of those types of properties that are already so very popular here.

The Chilean peso fell 1.6% against the dollar to 902.4, its lowest level since mid-November after data showed consumer prices in the 12 months through December rose at their slowest pace since June 2021, edging closer to the central bank\'s target. Traders expect the country\'s central bank to lower its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.50% at a monetary policy meeting next week, a poll of traders showed. ""The very low and lower-than-expected December headline and core prints, together with the dovish communication provided by the monetary policy committee in the December post-meeting statement and confirmed in the minutes, make another 75-basis-point cut the base case for the January monetary policy meeting,"" Goldman Sachs analyst said in a note. Declining copper prices also weighed on the peso. Chile is a top copper producer. More broadly, MSCI\'s indexes tracking Latin American stocks edged up 0.1%. A basket of regional currencies was mostly unchanged on the day as market participants eyed data later this week on U.S. inflation that could provide clues on when the Federal Reserve could reduce borrowing costs. ""What we\'re going to see over the next few weeks is conflicting signals across the macro data ... the totality of macro indicators almost need to align in a consistent message for the next cycle to begin,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex. Risk appetite has receded after mixed U.S. economic data on Friday added to investors\' uncertainty on the timing of rate cuts. Most Latin American stock indexes saw choppy trading, with the exception of Argentina\'s Merval index, which climbed 4.7% and touched a fresh record high of 1.105 million points. Brazil\'s Bovespa index reversed earlier losses to rise 0.1%, though a 1.4% fall in shares of state-run oil firm Petrobras weighed. Oil prices slid by more than 2% on sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and a rise in OPEC\'s output.

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at NRG Energy (NRG), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. NRG Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if NRG is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this power company holds up."", 'A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.', ""For NRG, shares are up 0.06% over the past week while the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry is up 1.18% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.2% compares favorably with the industry's 2.05% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of NRG Energy have risen 26.14%, and are up 60.65% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.72% and 25.16%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of NRG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NRG is averaging 2,780,671 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with NRG.', ""Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NRG's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.03 to $5.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that NRG is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep NRG Energy on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The steady top line growth serves as a positive affirmation that OneMain’s earning potential will remain compelling as easing inflation leads to more attractive interest rates for consumers and hopefully lower operating cost.', 'More impressive and perhaps most compelling to investors is that OneMain has been able to sustain its lofty dividend with a current yield of 8.17% which towers over the Zacks Financial-Consumer Loans Markets’ 2.2% and the S&P 500’s 1.4% average.

Still at just over $49, OneMain’s stock has soared +36% over the last year to top the S&P 500’s +22%, Synchrony’s +21%, and even beat Ally’s +33% while roughly matching LendingTree’s strong price performace.', 'Even better, when including dividends, OneMain’s total return over the last year is +50% to easily outperform the benchmark and many of its consumer lending peers.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Bottom Line', ""For now, OneMain Holdings' stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Chilean peso fell 1.6% against the dollar to 902.4, its lowest level since mid-November after data showed consumer prices in the 12 months through December rose at their slowest pace since June 2021, edging closer to the central bank\'s target. Traders expect the country\'s central bank to lower its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.50% at a monetary policy meeting next week, a poll of traders showed. ""The very low and lower-than-expected December headline and core prints, together with the dovish communication provided by the monetary policy committee in the December post-meeting statement and confirmed in the minutes, make another 75-basis-point cut the base case for the January monetary policy meeting,"" Goldman Sachs analyst said in a note. Declining copper prices also weighed on the peso. Chile is a top copper producer. More broadly, MSCI\'s indexes tracking Latin American stocks edged up 0.1%. A basket of regional currencies was mostly unchanged on the day as market participants eyed data later this week on U.S. inflation that could provide clues on when the Federal Reserve could reduce borrowing costs. ""What we\'re going to see over the next few weeks is conflicting signals across the macro data ... the totality of macro indicators almost need to align in a consistent message for the next cycle to begin,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex. Risk appetite has receded after mixed U.S. economic data on Friday added to investors\' uncertainty on the timing of rate cuts. Most Latin American stock indexes saw choppy trading, with the exception of Argentina\'s Merval index, which climbed 4.7% and touched a fresh record high of 1.105 million points. Brazil\'s Bovespa index reversed earlier losses to rise 0.1%, though a 1.4% fall in shares of state-run oil firm Petrobras weighed. Oil prices slid by more than 2% on sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and a rise in OPEC\'s output. Oil prices weighed on Mexican shares, which were down 0.1%, while Chilean stocks climbed 0.1%. Among individual names, shares in Santiago-listed LATAM Airlines jumped 5.5% after J.P.

The RTX 4070 Ti Super, meanwhile, is 1.6x faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. But, according to the company, those performance gains jump significantly when you add in Nvidia's AI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)."", 'With DLSS, the RTX 4080 Super is twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti, while the RTX 4070 Ti Super is 2.5x faster than the RTX 3070 Ti with DLSS. Even the RTX 4070 Super gets a big boost with DLSS, with 1.5x better performance than the RTX 3090.', ""That's a lot of names and numbers, but suffice it to say, these cards are going to offer gamers a sizable upgrade over Nvidia's prior generation of desktop graphics processing units (GPUs)."", 'But Nvidia is also framing these cards as powerful options for AI PCs, the new class of laptops and desktops designed to run AI applications natively rather than in the cloud. Nvidia joins AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) in the push to drive AI PCs into the consumer and enterprise landscape.', ""The idea behind AI PCs is that they will allow consumers and business users to access generative AI apps from their own devices, which should ensure that their private data isn't uploaded to the cloud or used to train AI software. But Intel and AMD have admitted that they're still waiting to see what kinds of programs and platforms developers come up with that take advantage of AI PC features."", 'Microsoft (MSFT) is so dedicated to the concept of the AI PC that it and its manufacturing partners are adding dedicated Copilot AI assistant keys to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards.

Apple’s chips are based on ARM processors.', 'The AI PC revolution is seen as the next major growth area for the PC industry, as manufacturers and developers lean into the massive explosion in interest in AI following the debut of ChatGPT in 2022. AMD, Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each already debuted their own laptop chips with AI capabilities, but AMD is the first to bring that to the desktop.', 'What exactly that does for consumers, though, is still largely up in the air. Sure, there are a handful of programs that take advantage of the neural engines available in AI PCs, but chipmakers are depending on developers to pump out a swath of applications that put their NPUs to the test.', 'According to chipmakers, using an onboard NPU means that you’ll be able to run generative AI applications on your device rather than in the cloud. That should mean that your data will stay secured on your own system, rather than having to send it to a third-party company’s servers where it could also be used to train that firm’s AI systems.', 'Cloud-based AI services can also require fees to process some requests, something that onboard AI programs won’t.', 'It’s not just chipmakers, either.

The first major change to the Windows keyboard in three decades, the Copilot button will call up Windows’ built-in Copilot AI assistant.', 'In addition to the Ryzen 8000 series’ NPU, AMD says the chip also packs the world’s fastest integrated desktop graphics processor. That means you’ll be able to play games like “Cyberpunk 2077” and “Far Cry 6” at frame rates of more than 60 frames per second.', 'The caveat here, though, is that you’ll have to opt for the high-end Ryzen 7 8700G version of the chip with a built-in Radeon 780M GPU and set the games’ performance to low with a resolution of 1080p.', 'If you’re a serious gamer, you’re still going to want to purchase a separate, dedicated graphics card. But the fact that you can even run those games on an integrated GPU is still impressive.', 'The new chips are also another shot at rival Intel as that company navigates its turnaround efforts and attempts to gain back market share it’s lost to AMD.', ""Shares of AMD have jumped 122% over the last 12 months as of the close of trading on Friday. Intel's stock price has climbed just 70% over the same period. Neither chipmaker, however, can touch Nvidia's (NVDA) performance.

But Greece\'s military is about to get an upgrade.', 'As the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency -- the Pentagon arm responsible for coordinating foreign military sales contracts -- advised Congress last month, the U.S. State Department has just cleared a Greek request to buy a whole fleet of new UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).', ""Assuming Congress approves the sale, Lockheed Martin stands to reap nearly $2 billion in revenue ($1.95 billion to be precise) from this deal. So what does this all mean for shareholders? Let's find out."", 'In this initial deal, Greece intends to purchase 35 Black Hawks from Lockheed, along with 80 engines to power them (two per helicopter, plus 10 spares), and a whole list of ancillary equipment (radar, radios, and other electronics, machine guns, rocket launchers, and ammunition, for example). Thus, multiple defense contractors are likely to share in the revenue from this deal -- but as primary contractor, all the money will run through Lockheed Martin.', ""Greece intends to use the new helicopters to replace the Hellenic Army's current multi-role helicopter fleet, which, according to data from FlightGlobal's 2024 World Air Forces report, leans heavily on 63 UH-1H Huey helicopters built by Textron's (NYSE: TXT) Bell Helicopter unit."", 'And that number may be instructive. Can 35 Black Hawks actually do the work of nearly twice as many Hueys? Perhaps, if the new Black Hawks are easier to maintain and require fewer repairs than the older Hueys they replace. But also perhaps not.', ""As it turns out, an October report from online news site FlightGlobal noted that Greece initially intended to purchase 49 Black Hawks from Lockheed. If it turns out that this remains Greece's intention, and the initial 35-helo purchase is just a first installment on Greece's shopping list, this deal could actually turn out to be about 40% bigger than it seems -- implying Lockheed Martin might get another $780 million in revenue out of it, growing the size of this deal to $2.7 billion."", ""What would that mean for Lockheed Martin? Rotary and mission systems, the Lockheed unit that owns Sikorsky and builds the Black Hawk, is currently the company's second-biggest revenue producer at $18.1 billion collected in 2022 (the most recent full year for which we have data). Rotary is the company's second to last most profitable segment, however, generating operating profit margins of only 9.2%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, a bit below the 10.5% operating profit margin for Lockheed Martin as a whole."", ""Thus, even at the upper end of its estimated value, this deal will only add about $250 million in incremental profits for Lockheed Martin, or about 3% of Lockheed's total annual take -- and this amount will probably be spread over a period of years. Thus, even at $2.7 billion, this deal isn't going to be enough to move the needle on Lockheed Martin stock, which still seems pricey to me at nearly 17 times earnings, and 1.7 times annual sales."", '(As a general rule, I prefer to buy defense stocks at a price-to-sales ratio of 1 or less.)', ""Curiously, defense investors might actually be better off taking a look at Textron, the company whose helicopters are being replaced (in Greece at least) by Lockheed's helicopters."", ""Seemingly priced similarly to Lockheed stock at 17 times trailing earnings, Textron's price-to-sales ratio of 1.2 seems closer to fair value. Analysts polled by S&P also anticipate that Textron will grow earnings faster than Lockheed over the next five years, at a rate approaching 12%, versus Lockheed Martin's growth rate of 7%."", 'While neither stock is a clear-cut buy for me at current prices, I suspect Textron stock is still closer to bargain territory than is Lockheed. Investors looking for a defense stock to own in 2024 should keep an eye on Textron.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for WEC Energy Group is:', '11% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, WEC Energy Group has a superior ROE than the average (9.3%) in the Integrated Utilities industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for WEC Energy Group visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by WEC Energy Group, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.49. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Here's why these three out-of-favor stocks are worth doubling down on now, before investors start to realize the opportunity they present."", 'Medtronic is one of the largest medical device makers on the planet. It operates in the cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical-surgical, and diabetes areas of the healthcare sector. Right now the stock is yielding a historically high 3.2%, suggesting that the shares are on sale. The dividend has been increased annually for 46 consecutive years, however, so this is no fly-by-night company, and it has proved that it places a high priority on returning value to shareholders through dividends.', ""But why is the dividend yield so high? The simple answer is that Medtronic has been having trouble getting new products over the finish line with regulators. If a product doesn't get approved, all of the money spent on research and development is effectively wasted. However, the backlog of products needing approval is working through the system and with positive outcomes. That's good, but now investors are worried about the impact that mass adoption of new weight-loss drugs might have on Medtronic's business. The company believes the fear is overblown, and investors with a long-term view should probably give management the benefit of the doubt on this one, focusing instead on the success with approvals. Although the current fiscal year might not be the best for Medtronic, the long-term future still looks pretty bright."", ""Texas Instruments makes microchips, which are highly cyclical products. The overall industry is currently in a downturn, so investors have shunned the stock just as they have most of the company's peers (AI chip makers are an exception, as this niche has attracted intense investor demand). Texas Instruments' dividend yield today is historically high at around 3.1% -- only this isn't your typical chip stock."", ""For starters, Texas Instruments has increased its dividend annually for two decades, which shows an incredible dedication to investors within an often volatile industry. Second, the company makes relatively simple products that have long shelf lives and go into just about every digital product. (To give you an idea, the company has more than 100,000 customers. In a world that's getting increasingly digital, it seems far more likely that demand goes up than down over the long term."", ""That's why it's so odd that investors are upset by Texas Instruments' capital spending plans right now. Essentially, the fear is that management is spending a lot of money on building additional production capacity during an industry downturn, but that spending will set the company up to exit the downturn a bigger and better competitor. Long-term investors should probably find management's countercyclical approach appealing."", ""Industrial company Stanley Black & Decker is probably the most aggressive name here, given that it's a turnaround situation. The toolmaker got itself into trouble thanks to a series of debt-funded acquisitions that left it overleveraged just as it had to deal with inflation and supply-chain disruptions around the coronavirus pandemic. Management has been trimming debt with asset sales, cost cuts, and attempts to better manage inventory levels. But adjusted earnings have dropped sharply, going from a record $10.48 in 2021 to an expected range of $1.10 to $1.40 per share in 2023. That's an ugly nosedive, and investors have punished the stock accordingly, pushing the yield up to a historically high 3.3%."", ""But management is starting to make some tangible headway. Leverage has been reduced, margin has been improving, and the company is expecting adjusted earnings to rebound strongly in 2024. As the company started its turnaround effort, it projected that earnings in 2024 could end up falling between $4 and $5 a share. Although it hasn't given 2024 guidance just yet, management confirmed to analysts during its third-quarter conference call that this range still seems reasonable. Given how weak earnings are going to be in 2023, even the low end of that range would mean a huge earnings improvement. Investors will probably change their view of Stanley Black & Decker if it can pull off this earnings rebound. Still, this Dividend King is the riskiest of the three options here, and it's probably most suitable for more aggressive investors."", ""Stocks don't end up with historically high yields for no reason, it usually means something is wrong. The question is whether that something is temporary or long-lasting. For Medtronic, Texas Instruments, and Stanley Black & Decker, it seems likely that the problems they're dealing with will pass, given enough time. If you share that view, then these historically reliable dividend stocks might just be worth doubling down on while Wall Street is still so negative on their respective outlooks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Texas Instruments right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Texas Instruments wasn't one of them.

I mean, more than 80% of analysts covering Merck think you should buy it."", ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely had that positive reaction from analysts for some time now. So it seems like this is definitely a sign of, you know, positive sentiment surrounding the name that have a name like Merck scooping them up."", 'JOSH LIPTON: For sure. All right, moving on to a big move in the c-suite here. Check out shares of Twilio, they are rising today on news that co-founder Jeff Lawson will be stepping down as CEO. Chief Communication Officer Khozema Shipchandler will be taking the reins as it struggles with two activist investors pushing for significant changes there.', ""So this is a big change there. Co-founder Jeff Lawson, well-known, the face really of Twilio at the software company for a long time. We should also mention, another longtime board member, Jeff Epstein, who's a partner over there at Bessemer, replacing Lawson, it looks like, as chairman. Separately, Twilio also said it expects to report Q4 revenue and non-GAAP operating income above the high end of guidance."", ""And RBC's Rishi Jaluria covers Twilio and has for a long time, telling his clients the news today still leaves a lot of questions, he says, around ongoing activist involvement. Potentially, he says, for more divestitures or maybe he says an outright sale given that you saw this new CEO already talking here, Madison, about taking a fresh look at the areas of the business that are underperforming to realize the full potential of the business. That's why Rishi says, maybe divestitures or an outright sale could be on the way here."", ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah, it's interesting, because Shipchandler also, I remember seeing his name in the news last week because he sold off about $800,000 worth of shares in the company previously. Now, obviously, they're having a great day, so not a great move for his personal portfolio there when you look at the green on the screen for Twilio."", ""But also definitely a win for activist investors, right? It feels like given some of the news that we're seeing across the street, even when I think about a Peltz or just the other activist investors that we talk about all the time, it feels like they're starting to impact some of the fundamental moves at these companies, even a company as big as Twilio, right, Josh?"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. And listen, Twilio has been dealing with some challenges. We know that the slower sales growth. Those activists you mentioned have been circling the company has responded. You saw a few different rounds of layoffs there. But we'll see what comes next with this new man in charge. Stocks up about 45% in the past 12 months."", ""MADISON MILLS: Well, something that I know you're going to be excited about, Josh-- Crocs, OK?"", ""JOSH LIPTON: I'm more of a Birkenstock guy, you know that."", ""MADISON MILLS: I could tell given the crocodile shoes you've got on there with the cowboy boots, but this is about Crocs, right, one of the biggest movers on our platform today, surging after the company updated its guidance this morning. Crocs saying it expects record full-year revenue in 2023 up almost 11% compared to the prior year."", ""Now what interests me about the stellar performance of this name is when I was on the floor of the stock exchange this morning, I was asking the guys to give me some talking points for my hit about 30 seconds before air as I like to do. And they talked about the bad forward guidance of Genesco. This is a company that has Journeys, some other footwear names that you might see at a place like PacSun if you're in the mall, updating their forward guidance but not in the right direction for the Street."", ""And we know that a name like Nike, which we're going to get to their news in a bit, but they've been struggling on sales as well. So it makes it really interesting to look at the stellar performance that we're seeing in Crocs today, what is it about them that is making them outpace the rest of the footwear market here. Is it something more idiosyncratic? Is it that-- I hate to say, is it that Crocs are trending? I mean, maybe it's just something as simple as the footwear choice of our consumers. But you can see in the stock performance that Crocs starting to outpace some of those competitors that I mentioned here."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I'm just looking over the analyst notes, too, just kind of reacting to these headlines say, some of the team at Stifel saying they are encouraged by the strong Q4 results and preliminary outlook, says it validates their expectations for earnings power at about 12 per share. They got to buy in the name target of 132."", ""We should point out, even with today's pop, the stock is in the red over the last year, though most on the Street fans, 10 buys, 4 holds, just 1 sell."", ""MADISON MILLS: Just 1 sell. And I mean, we never get a sell, so that's not great news. But it does indicate to me given the positivity that we're seeing in their forward guidance that this is a name that's going to have a good year.""]"

We are going to work with the NTSB who is investigating the accident itself to find out what the cause is.”', 'A company source told CNN that Boeing believes “the mistake in question” was introduced in the aircraft’s manufacturing supply chain, however it is not immediately clear if Calhoun identified any specific error during the presentation.', 'Boeing’s stock has shed some 8% on Monday as investors grow concerned about more damage to its business. Company shares fell another 1.5% Tuesday.', 'On Friday, an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people made an emergency landing shortly following takeoff\xa0from Portland, Oregon, after part of the wall of a weeks-old 737 Max 9 aircraft detached and left a gaping hole in\xa0the side of the plane. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily grounded as regulators and Boeing investigate the cause of the incident. The order applies to some 171 planes around the world.', 'Remarkably, no one was killed or seriously injured in Friday’s midflight accident, which was partially caught on horrifying video clips by fellow passengers.', 'Calhoun in the meeting praised the crew of the Alaska Airlines flight for their handling of the situation, the meeting\xa0video showed.', '“They train their lives to do that. But you don’t know until you know – I hope most never know,” he said. “But this crew, they stood the test and they delivered the airplane back home to us.”', 'The meeting also included a reminder of the seriousness of the situation. Employees were told that the company’s Chief Safety Officer is now in charge of the 737 Max fleet. Mike Delaney is Boeing’s Chief Aerospace Safety Officer.', 'The meeting, which took place at noon Pacific from the 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, also included an expression of confidence in “Boeing, the airplane, and (Boeing’s) employees,” the source said.', 'FAA pledge', 'The company pledged to work with the FAA to ensure there are proper inspections. On Tuesday, the FAA said that Boeing’s plan for the inspection of door plugs on 737 Max 9 aircraft required revisions, and the aircraft will remain grounded in the meantime.', '“Boeing offered an initial version of instructions yesterday which they are now revising because of feedback received in response,” the FAA said in a statement. “Upon receiving the revised version of instructions from Boeing the FAA will conduct a thorough review.”', 'During the meeting, Boeing also pledged to work with the NTSB as it tries to determine what took place. Calhoun also acknowledged “we have a communications task with all of our customers.”', '“We need to know we’re starting from a very anxious moment with our customers and we simply have to have to deal with that reality,” the CEO said. “So it’s gonna be a lot about transparency.”', 'Calhoun appeared to address some of the images that emerged from the accident during his remarks to employees Tuesday, including some that showed a gaping hole in the side of the plane.', '“When I got that picture, all I could think about – I didn’t know what happened so whoever was supposed to be in the seat next to that hole in the airplane,” Calhoun said. “I’ve got kids, I’ve got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters. Every detail matters.”', 'Of the ongoing investigation, Calhoun added that he “trust[s] every step they take, and they will get to a conclusion.”', 'The accident, meanwhile, is also garnering the attention of lawmakers. In a statement on Tuesday, Sen. J.D. Vance called for the Senate Commerce Committee to convene a hearing to “evaluate incidents involving the 737 MAX, Boeing’s engineering and safety standards, and the quality of oversight provided by the FAA and other relevant government agencies.”', '“I hope such a hearing will occur as soon as possible,” Vance, a Republican from Ohio, added.', 'President Joe Biden is personally tracking the grounding of many Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes for inspection following the dramatic emergency landing of the Alaska Airlines flight last week, the White House said Tuesday, as investigations continue.', 'The White House is “relieved” that all passengers and crew of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 are safe, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, noting that the aircraft will remain grounded until FAA operators “complete enhanced inspections.”', 'Exactly what led to a hole the size of a refrigerator to suddenly blow open on the passenger aircraft on Friday is still being investigated. A preliminary report is expected in three to four weeks, National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Eric Weiss said.', 'The NTSB said Monday night that it continues to recover objects that blew out of the plane. On Sunday, a Portland schoolteacher found a piece of the aircraft’s fuselage that had landed\xa0in his backyard and reached out to the agency. Two cell phones that were likely flung from the hole in the plane were also found in a yard and on the side of the road and turned over to investigators.', 'NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy also told reporters over the weekend that Alaska Airlines had previously restricted the aircraft in Friday’s incident from flying over the ocean\xa0after the plane’s automatic pressurization warning light came on three times in the past month. Homendy, however, emphasized during a press conference late Monday night that the NTSB has “no indications whatsoever that this correlated in any way” to the incident that led to a piece of the plane from blowing off.', 'Homendy has said that partly complicating the investigation is the loss of critical cockpit audio recordings, because of a device setting that overrides recordings after collecting two hours of audio. She advocated for the FAA and Congress to require 24-hour recordings of cockpit audio to be retained in all aircraft.', 'Still, as investigators continue to comb through data, eyewitness accounts and examine the jet itself, the early details from the investigation are harrowing. The damage extended to several rows on the plane. The two seats next to the detached door plug just happened to be empty when the blowout happened, but had their headrests torn off, according to Homendy.', 'Video from the incident “looks very calm, but I’m sure it was completely chaotic,” Homendy said.', 'Also on Monday, United Airlines – which has more Max 9s than any other US carrier – said it found loose door plug bolts on an undisclosed number of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft as it was performing the FAA-mandated inspections of the jets. Alaska Airlines also said Monday it found loose hardware on some of its 737 Max 9 planes during inspections.', 'Friday’s high-profile incident is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing’s fall from grace in recent years. The company has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft over the past five years, leading to the long-term grounding of some of its jets and the halt in deliveries of others.', 'The most glaring quality problems for Boeing came with the 737 Max’s design, which was judged to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion. But the design flaws that caused the crashes brought to light questions about the decision making process at Boeing. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”', 'The latest safety saga also puts a spotlight on the fact that Boeing most likely doesn’t have to worry about being forced out of business anytime soon, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Boeing and Airbus are the only two major global aviation companies, neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand alone, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years.', 'CNN’s Chris Isidore, Gregory Wallace, Pete Muntean, Betsy Klein and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

It still sells golf clothing and footwear,” he said.', 'Smallwood said he would be surprised if the breakup was due to any concern that Woods was nearing the end of his career.', '“Woods is synonymous with golf. Nike has stuck with him through his life trials and his comebacks,” he said. “Woods can play as long as he wants to in the PGA and then the Senior PGA. Look how long Nike has held on to Michael Jordan.

Butler Golf, called Woods a savvy business person “who understands that the landscape of golf is changing.”', '“Nike has been pulling away from golf products. Tiger has vast opportunity to land somewhere else,” said Butler. “Golf clothing companies are coming into the market with other options, better options and varied price points.”', '“It’s not that Nike has done anything wrong, it’s not that Tiger Woods may not necessarily be happy with his relationship with Nike for the last 27 years, but this is a golden opportunity to go after a younger crowd, to go after individuals who aren’t rich that want to play the game,” he said. “Tiger understands that, the importance of what he’s meant to the golf industry as well as to people of color.

Yeah, visible on the head, chest, and shoulders of the face of golf for decades was one logo, the swoosh. Prominently positioned during Tiger Woods wins and iconic Sunday red appearances. Today, Nike and Woods part ways. Here's a look at the value of some of the deals between Woods and Nike. Woods sparked question and fodder for conversation during the 2022 masters by wearing FootJoy shoes, an Acushnet subsidiary, instead of his Nike designed footwear, with accompanying TW logo. Perhaps the beginning of the end for the 27-year relationship between golf's most recognizable figure in Woods, and Nike, the world's most recognizable athletic manufacturer."", ""So what's the price action and potential trade ability on the Tiger news. Well, shares of Nike, they've been trending on the Yahoo Finance platform on this news. And Nike for itself, we should note is in the midst of a cost efficiency push, which impacts everything from head count to product line considerations. The company is also continuing to expand Jordan brand, beyond basketball, into golf, global football, and American football, and Jordan women's and kids. And this Jordan brand continues to lead the brand at Nike and the overall growth, as communicated to investors during its 2024 fiscal second quarter earnings call."", 'Next up, we got to check in on shares of Acushnet. This is the parent company of FootJoy. And they manufacture the golf shoes Tiger currently wears. Plus, also the parent company of Titleist, the golf ball and club maker who actually manufactured the Titleist 681T irons that Woods used in his four major championships in 2000 and 2001, which were actually later sold for over $5 million with Goldin auctions.', ""We reached out to a representative for the company who says that Acushnet had nothing further to share in the immediate morning of the news breaking. The other perhaps longer shot possibility could be Top Golf Callaway, and this one is, of course, a Phil Mickelson fame. So we won't dilly dally there for too long. But say you don't want to trade Tiger specifically but want to trade the sport, well, golf. Let's consider this. The sport has already experienced a post-pandemic surge as athletes look for outdoor activities, but is unquestionably still among the more expensive sports."", ""Wealthier consumer groups, they may continue to spend, but equipment and apparel sales are probably going to lag the same boom that was seen during 2020. So the trade perhaps that's still offers golf exposure is airlines, with routes to the most golf forward destinations. While partnerships they begin and end, one thing will remain for sure for Tiger fanatics, on Sundays, we wear red."", ""- All right, Brad. Thank you so much. I really hope that you are either heading to the airport to head down to Florida, or you're at least getting some top golf in after that fantastic report. We really appreciate it, Brad.

Determination of TF expression is not required. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of tisotumab vedotin-tftv is due to the binding of the ADC to TF-expressing cancer cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-TF complex, and release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. MMAE disrupts the microtubule network of actively dividing cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.

This makes the dividend yield 5.7%, which is above the industry average."", ' See our latest analysis for Pfizer ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Pfizer was paying out quite a large proportion of both earnings and cash flow, with the dividend being 116% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows can expose the business to needing to cut the dividend if the business runs into some challenges."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 27.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 74%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.96 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.68. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.8% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.', ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Pfizer's earnings per share has shrunk at 14% a year over the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Pfizer's payments are rock solid. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Pfizer that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

It was one of the S&P 500's worst-performing stocks last year. The company's COVID-19 revenue nosedived as the demand for vaccinations waned, and the drugmaker can no longer count on that being a strong growth driver for the business."", 'But with such a beaten-down valuation and Pfizer back to trading at 2020 levels, has the stock become too cheap of an investment to pass up? Is it only a matter of time before its shares rally again? What will happen this year?', ""The big reason Pfizer's stock could do well this year is its valuation. After such a bad showing in 2023, there's a possibility that the markets and investors were overly punitive on the stock and overreacted to the company's struggles. After all, a slowdown in revenue was expected as concerns related to the pandemic subsided."", ""Today, the shares trade at just 13 times the drugmaker's estimated future earnings. That's based on analysts' expectations of the company's earnings in the year ahead; they aren't based on trailing earnings and the inflated profits Pfizer benefited from thanks to higher COVID-19-related revenue. Gauging by its projected future profits, shares trade at a sizable discount; the average healthcare stock has a forward earnings multiple of 21."", ""Investors are heavily discounting Pfizer's stock. But even Wall Street sees some promising upside. According to the consensus analyst price target of just under $40, shares of Pfizer could rise by more than 35% from where they trade today. Price targets usually project where a stock could go in the short term (typically a year or so). In the long run, there could be more upside for Pfizer."", ""While Pfizer's shares look undervalued, there is still the risk that they could underperform in 2024. When the company released its guidance last month, it projected revenue between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion for this year -- comparable to what it expects to generate in 2023. That includes the benefit from the drugmaker's recent acquisition of Seagen and also factors in $8 billion in COVID-19-related revenue."", 'The danger is that the company could overestimate COVID-19 revenue, which could lead to an underwhelming revenue result for 2024. Sales of Comirnaty are down 78% year over year through the first nine months of 2023, and predicting how strong that figure will be this year could prove to be difficult. If Pfizer undershoots its forecast, that might give investors a reason to be even more bearish on the stock.', ""A further wrinkle is the drugmaker's flurry of acquisitions. Pfizer has bought multiple companies within the past few years, including Seagen. And those acquisitions add costs and redundancies, which can take time to eliminate. In its most recent quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, Pfizer posted a net loss of $2.4 billion (including a $5.6 billion non-cash charge related to inventory write-offs and other costs for Comirnaty and Paxlovid)."", ""While the company's bottom line should improve, if acquisitions-related expenses weigh down the business too much this year, that could make the stock ripe for another sell-off."", ""I don't expect a huge turnaround for Pfizer's stock this year because of the obstacles it faces in growth and profitability. If it does rally, it'll likely be a modest rebound for the healthcare giant."", ""If, however, you're willing to buy and hold shares for the long haul, Pfizer can still be a good stock to own as the company rebuilds its business over the long term -- just don't expect any huge gains this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

One has rapid growth momentum and the other has an extremely cheap valuation.', ""SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) certainly isn't the first online bank, the first app-based brokerage, or the first personal lender. The difference between SoFi and the other companies in those categories is that the others tend to be used in conjunction with traditional banks."", ""SoFi, on the other hand, has enjoyed more success as a bank replacement than any of its peers. It aims to be its customers' only bank, providing all the financial services they need."", 'The business momentum has been spectacular. The company grew its membership base at a 47% year-over-year rate in the most recent quarter, and customers added more than 1 million new products (like a checking or brokerage account), the highest one-quarter total ever.', ""SoFi's deposit base has grown from literally nothing at the beginning of 2022, when it received its banking license, to $15.7 billion. Management has said -- and has reiterated -- that it will achieve GAAP profitability for the first time when it reports its fourth-quarter earnings in a few weeks."", ""The bank could potentially keep its growth trajectory going for years to come. It's the fastest-growing U.S. bank in its class and is currently the 80th largest bank in the country. As more people join SoFi's ecosystem, the more the network effect will fuel its growth."", ""PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock hasn't received a lot of love from investors and analysts recently. And there are some good reasons why. The company's growth slowed significantly after the pandemic-fueled surge, and management conceded that its previous growth targets were (to put it mildly) unrealistic."", ""However, there's still a lot to like about this business. For starters, it's not as if growth has disappeared. The number of active accounts has fallen by about 1% over the past year as PayPal chose to focus on its most engaged customers, but this strategy is paying off."", ""Despite the lower account total, PayPal's total payment volume increased 15% year over year in the most recent quarter, and the company generated 8% revenue growth as a result. This business could still have plenty of room for long-term user growth once the churn from low-engagement accounts that were added in recent years plays out."", ""Additionally, PayPal's business is an absolute cash machine. It generates more than $5 billion in annualized free cash flow, and the company is putting most of it into share buybacks -- a good indicator that management thinks the stock is cheap. I agree. This proven fintech winner trades for just 11.5 times forward earnings estimates."", 'Nobody has a crystal ball that can predict which stocks could make you rich. But these two could make it happen. SoFi is still a small bank and has tremendous momentum. PayPal has tons of optionality and is too cheap to ignore.', ""There's a lot of execution risk here.

Among these, the most popular are price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio). Though used less often, it is an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.', 'The P/B ratio is calculated as below:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity', 'Now let us understand the concept of book value.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Park Hotels & Resorts PK, Qifu Technology QFIN, Centene CNC and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are our five picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. PK, General Motors Company GM, Graphic Packaging Holding Company GPK and Itron, Inc. ITRI boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap."", ""Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the six stocks that qualified the screening:Park Hotels & Resorts, one of the largest publicly traded lodging REITs, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has gained 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -50%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $7.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.5%.

However, a decrease in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income acted as a headwind.', 'Notably, PNC Financial has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.41%, on average.', '\xa0', 'The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Quote', 'In October, PNC Financial, through an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, purchased a portfolio of capital commitment facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A.', 'PNC Financial purchased a portfolio of $16.6 billion in total commitments. The acquired portfolio primarily consists of credit lines to private equity firms. These credit lines help firms manage liquidity and get financing for investments. Of this, more than half or $9 billion of the acquired portfolio was in funded loans.The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to the bank’s earnings by 10 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2023.', 'Now, let us discuss factors that are likely to have impacted PNC Financial’s fourth-quarter performance.', 'Loans and NII:\xa0Banks’ lending activities have been subdued in the fourth quarter due to low corporate confidence, an uncertain macroeconomic outlook and high interest rates. While demand for commercial real estate loans improved slightly in November from the third-quarter 2023 end, per the Fed’s latest\xa0data, consumer lending showed no signs of advancement. Moreover, the demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened in the first two months of the quarter under review from third-quarter 2023.', 'Also, while the Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in fourth-quarter 2023, interest rates were at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%.', 'An overall slowdown in loan demand and high interest rates are expected to have affected PNC’s lending activities in the quarter under review.', 'As for deposits, banks are likely to have enjoyed a stronger seasonal uptick in deposits. This, along with slower outflow of money to high-yielding alternatives and limited deposit pricing pressure, is expected to have reduced funding pressure for banks. This is expected to have aided fourth-quarter 2023 NII.', 'The company expects average loans to rise 3% sequentially. Management anticipates NII to decline 1-2% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $3.41 billion indicates a sequential decline of 3.6%. We predict NII on a FTE basis of $3.39 billion.', 'Non-Interest Revenues: The high inflation was curbed in the fourth quarter. This is likely to have decreased consumer card transactions and spending volumes, thereby hindering PNC’s card fees in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for card and cash management revenues of $687 million suggests a sequential fall.', 'The consensus estimate of $347 million for asset management and brokerage revenues implies a marginal sequential fall.', 'In the fourth quarter, mortgage rates declined, with the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage falling to 6.61% in December from 7.31% in September end. Nonetheless, due to home price appreciation, origination volumes (both purchase and refinancing) remained lower than that in the prior quarter.', 'Thus, these factors are expected to have hurt PNC Financial’s residential and commercial mortgage revenues.

The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years.

The Chilean peso fell 1.6% against the dollar to 902.4, its lowest level since mid-November after data showed consumer prices in the 12 months through December rose at their slowest pace since June 2021, edging closer to the central bank\'s target. Traders expect the country\'s central bank to lower its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.50% at a monetary policy meeting next week, a poll of traders showed. ""The very low and lower-than-expected December headline and core prints, together with the dovish communication provided by the monetary policy committee in the December post-meeting statement and confirmed in the minutes, make another 75-basis-point cut the base case for the January monetary policy meeting,"" Goldman Sachs analyst said in a note. Declining copper prices also weighed on the peso. Chile is a top copper producer. More broadly, MSCI\'s indexes tracking Latin American stocks edged up 0.1%. A basket of regional currencies was mostly unchanged on the day as market participants eyed data later this week on U.S. inflation that could provide clues on when the Federal Reserve could reduce borrowing costs. ""What we\'re going to see over the next few weeks is conflicting signals across the macro data ... the totality of macro indicators almost need to align in a consistent message for the next cycle to begin,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex. Risk appetite has receded after mixed U.S. economic data on Friday added to investors\' uncertainty on the timing of rate cuts. Most Latin American stock indexes saw choppy trading, with the exception of Argentina\'s Merval index, which climbed 4.7% and touched a fresh record high of 1.105 million points. Brazil\'s Bovespa index reversed earlier losses to rise 0.1%, though a 1.4% fall in shares of state-run oil firm Petrobras weighed. Oil prices slid by more than 2% on sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and a rise in OPEC\'s output. Oil prices weighed on Mexican shares, which were down 0.1%, while Chilean stocks climbed 0.1%. Among individual names, shares in Santiago-listed LATAM Airlines jumped 5.5% after J.P.

And while plastic cards are more widely available, metal cards are also an option. These cards are generally made of stainless steel, titanium, brass, palladium, gold, copper, or another metal alloy. Because of this, they’re often more durable than their plastic counterparts.', 'Durability is a benefit, but metal credit cards also have potential drawbacks. Here’s how metal cards came to be, their pros and cons, who they’re right for, and some options if you’d like to add one to your wallet.', 'Metal credit cards trace their origins back to the early 1900s when department stores issued loyalty cards and coins to customers. These coins and cards were used as an early form of credit, allowing users to run tabs and pay at a later date.', 'The plastic cards we’re familiar with were introduced in the 1950s when businessmen Frank McNamara and Ralph Schnieder created the Diners Club Card. While there were also early iterations of metal cards, the first modern-day metal card wasn’t introduced until the turn of this century when American Express launched its invite-only, ultra-luxe metal Centurion Card, also known as the Black Card. Several metal credit cards are available today, and you don’t need to be wealthy or famous to apply for one.', 'Durability: Plastic cards often get damaged with regular use, but metal cards are more durable and less likely to fade or break.', 'Aesthetics: Those seeking a premium card may appreciate that metal cards are heavier and look more expensive than their plastic counterparts.', 'Exclusive benefits: Many metal credit cards have benefits beyond durability and aesthetics. For instance, you can often earn a lucrative welcome offer; get airport lounge access, travel credits, trip insurance, and more with a metal card.', 'Annual fees: Metal credit cards may come with higher annual fees than plastic credit cards, so adding one to your wallet generally only makes sense if the benefits you get with your card outweigh the cost.', 'Hard to destroy: If you need to close your account for any reason, your metal credit card will be more difficult to destroy. These cards generally can’t be cut up with scissors or put through a paper shredder. Instead, you might need to mail your card back to the issuer to dispose of it.', 'May set off metal detectors: It’s possible your metal card could set off a metal detector at the airport or another location if you forget to take it out of your pocket.', 'Whether a metal credit card is the right option for your wallet depends on a few factors. Since metal cards often come with travel perks and high annual fees, one may make sense if you travel often for business or pleasure. That’s because taking advantage of all your card’s travel perks can make it fairly easy to offset its annual fee.', 'If you’re looking for a durable card but don’t travel often, the annual cost of a metal card may outweigh its benefits. In this case, a plastic card probably makes more sense, even if you need to replace it every few years.', ""Comparing the following can help you find the best card for your situation if you're considering a metal card."", 'Annual fees', 'APRs', 'Welcome offers', 'Rewards rates', 'Travel credits', 'Travel insurance', 'Reward redemption options', 'Several metal credit cards are available today, and most aren’t invite-only, which makes them more accessible.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$981.5m', 'US$1.02b', 'US$1.20b', 'US$1.25b', 'US$1.29b', 'US$1.33b', 'US$1.36b', 'US$1.40b', 'US$1.43b', 'US$1.46b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 3.66%', 'Est @ 3.23%', 'Est @ 2.92%', 'Est @ 2.71%', 'Est @ 2.56%', 'Est @ 2.46%', 'Est @ 2.39%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% ', 'US$901', 'US$860', 'US$931', 'US$886', 'US$840', 'US$794', 'US$748', 'US$705', 'US$663', 'US$623', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.0b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tapestry as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.341. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Here's why these three out-of-favor stocks are worth doubling down on now, before investors start to realize the opportunity they present."", 'Medtronic is one of the largest medical device makers on the planet. It operates in the cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical-surgical, and diabetes areas of the healthcare sector. Right now the stock is yielding a historically high 3.2%, suggesting that the shares are on sale. The dividend has been increased annually for 46 consecutive years, however, so this is no fly-by-night company, and it has proved that it places a high priority on returning value to shareholders through dividends.', ""But why is the dividend yield so high? The simple answer is that Medtronic has been having trouble getting new products over the finish line with regulators. If a product doesn't get approved, all of the money spent on research and development is effectively wasted. However, the backlog of products needing approval is working through the system and with positive outcomes. That's good, but now investors are worried about the impact that mass adoption of new weight-loss drugs might have on Medtronic's business. The company believes the fear is overblown, and investors with a long-term view should probably give management the benefit of the doubt on this one, focusing instead on the success with approvals. Although the current fiscal year might not be the best for Medtronic, the long-term future still looks pretty bright."", ""Texas Instruments makes microchips, which are highly cyclical products. The overall industry is currently in a downturn, so investors have shunned the stock just as they have most of the company's peers (AI chip makers are an exception, as this niche has attracted intense investor demand). Texas Instruments' dividend yield today is historically high at around 3.1% -- only this isn't your typical chip stock."", ""For starters, Texas Instruments has increased its dividend annually for two decades, which shows an incredible dedication to investors within an often volatile industry. Second, the company makes relatively simple products that have long shelf lives and go into just about every digital product. (To give you an idea, the company has more than 100,000 customers. In a world that's getting increasingly digital, it seems far more likely that demand goes up than down over the long term."", ""That's why it's so odd that investors are upset by Texas Instruments' capital spending plans right now. Essentially, the fear is that management is spending a lot of money on building additional production capacity during an industry downturn, but that spending will set the company up to exit the downturn a bigger and better competitor. Long-term investors should probably find management's countercyclical approach appealing."", ""Industrial company Stanley Black & Decker is probably the most aggressive name here, given that it's a turnaround situation. The toolmaker got itself into trouble thanks to a series of debt-funded acquisitions that left it overleveraged just as it had to deal with inflation and supply-chain disruptions around the coronavirus pandemic. Management has been trimming debt with asset sales, cost cuts, and attempts to better manage inventory levels. But adjusted earnings have dropped sharply, going from a record $10.48 in 2021 to an expected range of $1.10 to $1.40 per share in 2023. That's an ugly nosedive, and investors have punished the stock accordingly, pushing the yield up to a historically high 3.3%."", ""But management is starting to make some tangible headway. Leverage has been reduced, margin has been improving, and the company is expecting adjusted earnings to rebound strongly in 2024. As the company started its turnaround effort, it projected that earnings in 2024 could end up falling between $4 and $5 a share. Although it hasn't given 2024 guidance just yet, management confirmed to analysts during its third-quarter conference call that this range still seems reasonable. Given how weak earnings are going to be in 2023, even the low end of that range would mean a huge earnings improvement. Investors will probably change their view of Stanley Black & Decker if it can pull off this earnings rebound. Still, this Dividend King is the riskiest of the three options here, and it's probably most suitable for more aggressive investors."", ""Stocks don't end up with historically high yields for no reason, it usually means something is wrong. The question is whether that something is temporary or long-lasting. For Medtronic, Texas Instruments, and Stanley Black & Decker, it seems likely that the problems they're dealing with will pass, given enough time. If you share that view, then these historically reliable dividend stocks might just be worth doubling down on while Wall Street is still so negative on their respective outlooks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Texas Instruments right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Texas Instruments wasn't one of them.

The company also delivered strong performances in its gaming and professional visualization segments.', 'Additionally, Nvidia said third-quarter non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income rocketed 593% to $4.02 per diluted share. The impetus behind that improved profitability was a 19-percentage-point increase in non-GAAP gross profit margin. Management attributed that margin expansion to an improved data center product mix, suggesting that high-margin software and services accounted for more of total sales.', 'In the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to reach $20 billion, implying a sequential acceleration to 230% revenue growth.

Huang says the three new elements of the company's growth strategy are hitting their stride, hinting at sustained momentum in the coming years."", 'Today, Nvidia values its addressable market at $1 trillion, but that figure will continue to climb higher as more enterprises incorporate AI and ML into their products and services. Indeed, the AI market is forecast to grow at 37% annually through 2030. In that context, investors can expect Nvidia to achieve annual revenue growth in the mid-20% range for years to come.', 'Moreover, analysts at Morningstar expect the company to grow revenue at 22% annually over the next decade.

Investors, of course, aspire to find the next candidate with the potential to join such elite company. Odds are, every company that has reached that milestone has made many fortunes for investors along the way.', 'Case in point: Artificial intelligence (AI) chip star Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) began 2023 at just a $350 billion market cap, but has more than tripled since, reaching a market cap today exceeding $1.2 trillion!', 'So, where to find the next big winner? It may not be surprising that I think the AI revolution could mint even more trillion-dollar companies, like this key Nvidia rival.', 'Given the explosive growth in AI computing we are seeing and are likely to see through this decade, those tailwinds could potentially propel Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to new heights.', ""That is, of course, only true if the company executes. But AMD's execution has been excellent ever since Lisa Su took over as CEO in October 2014. Back then, AMD had just a $2.4 billion market cap -- yes, you read that right. Fast forward to today, and AMD's market cap has gone up nearly one hundred times under her tenure, to $223 billion."", 'How did AMD do it? As is usually the case, a lot of skill, planning, and a little bit of luck.', 'First, Su made the choice to diversify away from PCs, where AMD got 90% of its revenue at the time, and into more high-end applications such as gaming, embedded chips, and data center processors. Second, Su used the 2017 transition to FinFet transistors to attempt to catch up to market leader Intel in process technology.', 'At the time, Intel had a near-monopoly on the processor market and leading technology. AMD practically existed just so many customers would have a secondary option for cheap processors and keep Intel from having 100% of the market. But as chipmaking became more complex, with FinFets and the 7-nanometer process node, Intel stumbled.', ""Meanwhile, AMD's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) excelled and pulled ahead of Intel on leading-edge chipmaking. That left an opportunity for AMD to actually leap ahead of Intel in terms of power and performance, enabling it to gobble up market share from a near-zero starting point."", 'Given that AMD was able to meet and overtake a large and dominant rival in PC processors, can the company do it again with AI accelerators?', 'While Nvidia has a big lead in that area today, AMD introduced its challenger MI300 line of AI accelerators in June 2023. The MI300, unlike the all-in-one die that hosts Nvidia\'s H100, is made up of a ""chiplet"" architecture consisting of 12 chiplets. That architecture allows for some advantages, including a whopping 153 billion transistors, with the ability to handle 192 gigabytes of HBM3 memory. That compares with the H100\'s ""mere"" 80 billion transistors and just 80GB of HBM memory capacity.', 'In light of these specs, AMD certainly has a shot at getting some looks from AI customers, especially those with memory-hungry applications. No wonder Su has said she expects at least $2 billion in revenue for the MI300 accelerators in 2024, despite just ramping production recently.', ""While the MI300 exceeds the H100 on certain specs, investors shouldn't expect AMD to match Nvidia any time soon. One important difference is that the MI300 doesn't have the transformer engine of the H100, which can be turned on to triple the H100's performance. That would, of course, shorten the time to train large language models, and could keep customers in the H100 for the most pressing applications."", 'Another advantage for Nvidia is that it will already be coming out with the H200 in the second quarter, and will move on to an entirely new architecture, the B100, next fall/winter. In October 2023, Nvidia announced that it would move from a two-year cadence to a one-year cadence for new AI chip architectures. Given that AMD is just ramping the MI300 now, it will actually be competing more with these newer chips than with the H100. And since Nvidia is now going into turbo-speed, it may be hard for AMD to eventually catch up.', 'This is especially true because Nvidia also uses TSMC as its foundry, so Nvidia will likely not stumble in the way Intel did five years ago. If TSMC stumbles, both Nvidia and AMD would suffer together.', ""In addition, Nvidia has been developing its CUDA software stack since 2006, and has achieved a nice network effect with developers. AMD is quickly developing its own quasi-open-source software stack called RocM, which it's piecing together from its own research and development combined with several recent acquisitions last year. Still, a 15-year-plus head start will be difficult to overcome quickly."", 'Even if AMD forever remains a ""next-best"" option for AI chips, it\'s possible the AI market could be large enough that AMD will reach $1 trillion anyway. After all, at its December 2023 presentation, Su increased her projection for the AI chip market from $150 billion to $400 billion by 2027.', 'While some of that increase comes from chips for ""AI PCs,"" the good news is that AMD will potentially have an even better chance at leading that market, considering its strong position in PCs today.', ""AMD hit $24 billion in revenue in 2022 before the PC downturn caused a slight dip this year. But even an incremental 10% of the $400 billion AI chip market could propel AMD's revenue to, say, $65 billion by 2027. Assuming a 30% net income margin, that could yield $20 billion in earnings. So a price-to-earnings multiple of 50 could get AMD to a $1 trillion market cap by that time."", ""That may seem like a high valuation, but it's a pretty good bet that the AI chip market will continue growing beyond 2027. It's also quite possible AMD could get more than that modest 10% share of the AI chip market. So by 2030, it's certainly a fair shot to get to that $1 trillion market cap, more than four times today's valuation."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Initially, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has seemed prepared to cut production as necessary."", ""Like most oil stocks, Chevron stock is affordably priced at a price-to-earnings ratio of 11, and it offers an appealing dividend yield of 4%.

The average growth rate among members of the S&P 500 has been around 6% annually over the last five years. ', 'Prologis (NYSE: PLD) and Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX) are anything but average. The real estate investment trusts (REITs) gave their investors big raises last year, continuing their trend of delivering above-average dividend growth. They should have no problem providing an encore performance in 2024.', ""Leading industrial REIT Prologis increased its dividend by 10% last year. That continued its trend of delivering above-average dividend growth. It has grown its payout at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, double the average of the S&P 500 and REIT sector. That's a strong growth rate for a company that also offers an above-average dividend yield (2.7%, compared to 1.5% for the S&P 500). "", ""The REIT should continue growing its payout at an above-average rate in 2024 and beyond. A big factor driving that view is Prologis' embedded rent growth. The warehouse owner expects its existing portfolio's same-store net operating income to grow at a 7.5% to 8.5% annual rate over the next three years. The main driver will be expiring leases, which will enable the REIT to sign new contracts at much higher market rates. "", ""On top of that, Prologis should benefit from the continued expansion of its portfolio. The REIT has a large land bank, giving it a lot of room to build additional warehouses or invest in higher-and-better-use projects (like data centers). The company's organic growth drivers alone (rising rents and development projects) should power 9% to 11% annual core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth over the next three years. "", 'The company also has an elite balance sheet (and access to third-party capital), giving it lots of flexibility to make acquisitions. Over the last three years, M&A has contributed an incremental 1.5% annually to its FFO per share. Add it all up, and Prologis should be able to continue growing its dividend at a double-digit annual rate. ', 'Equinix supercharged its dividend last year. The leading data center REIT increased its payment by 10% in February. It followed that up by giving investors a monster 25% raise in October. ', 'The company has now increased its dividend every year since converting to a REIT in 2015, growing the payout at a more than 12% compound annual rate. Meanwhile, its raises over the past year have helped push its dividend yield up to an above-average 2.2%. ', 'The data center operator expects to continue delivering strong dividend growth over the next few years. Equinix anticipates investing $3 billion annually through 2027 on organic capital projects to maintain and expand its global data center platform. Those investments power its expectations that its revenue will grow by 8% to 12% per year, reaching $12 billion by 2027. That should drive 7% to 10% annual adjusted FFO-per-share growth. ', ""That plan has ample upside because it doesn't include two notable growth catalysts: M&A and artificial intelligence (AI). "", 'Equinix has a long history of making value-enhancing acquisitions. It has generated about $3 billion of incremental value since 2018 through M&A. Meanwhile, AI could supercharge its development plans. The company estimates that AI infrastructure could be a $60 billion market opportunity by 2026. ', 'Equinix can deliver robust dividend growth without factoring in those upside catalysts. The company anticipates that its current embedded growth drivers and low dividend payout ratio (45% in 2023) will support 10%-plus dividend-per-share growth through at least 2027. ', ""Prologis and Equinix have been great dividend growth stocks over the years. This trend should continue in 2024. That's excellent news for their investors, since dividend growers have historically delivered above-average total annual returns (10.2% versus 7.7% for the average stock in the S&P 500 over the last 50 years).

The move contrasts sharply with the 46% gain of its rival, FedEx, over the same period. What went so badly wrong for UPS in 2023, and where is it heading in 2024?', ""First, there's a difference between something working against a company and something working against its stock. It's a subtle but telling differentiation. In this case, it relates to investors' expectations for UPS going into 2023. The company was coming off of a 2022 when it had already hit the 2023 targets laid out at its investor day in June 2021."", ""It was reasonable for investors to expect further progress in 2023, but unfortunately, that didn't happen, and UPS is expected to report a revenue and earnings decline when it gives its full-year earnings. Market expectations were too high in early 2023."", 'Second, UPS got stuck in protracted labor contract negotiations. The new contracts increased costs, and the threat of strikes encouraged customers to divert deliveries to other networks, including FedEx. The latter\'s management claims it retained the ""majority of the high-quality volume,"" while UPS believes it\'s winning it back. Still, the issue hit UPS to the tune of 1.5 million packages per day diverted in the third quarter.', 'Third, the economy slowed in 2023, which slowed volumes at UPS, causing them to come in lower than expected, even before the labor dispute impacted its operations.', 'Consequently, UPS revenue is expected to decline by 8.7% in 2023, with earnings per share down 32% to $8.81.', 'While last year was disappointing, all the reasons for the stock price decline can turn around through this year. The labor dispute is now settled, and expectations for the stock are currently set. In addition, UPS can grow by winning back lost volumes.', 'Lower interest rates later in the year should help UPS volumes to recover. And finally, I would argue that UPS enters 2024 with negative investor sentiment behind it, so the stock could be set up to exceed expectations this year.', 'Meanwhile, management continues progressing toward its strategic objectives of growing revenue in targeted areas like healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses. As such, it looks like an excellent value stock option for patient investors and comes with a dividend yield currently above 4%.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and United Parcel Service wasn't one of them.

To top it off, vagueness related to the Federal Reserve's intention to trim interest rates has somehow dampened investors' sentiment as well. The recent minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee have shown that officials were not sure when to cut interest rates and have kept the option to hike rates if inflation spikes again."", ""Needless to say, interest rate hikes raise borrowing costs, hamper consumer spending, and disrupt economic growth vis-à-vis the stock market's upward trajectory.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.

But Greece\'s military is about to get an upgrade.', 'As the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency -- the Pentagon arm responsible for coordinating foreign military sales contracts -- advised Congress last month, the U.S. State Department has just cleared a Greek request to buy a whole fleet of new UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).', ""Assuming Congress approves the sale, Lockheed Martin stands to reap nearly $2 billion in revenue ($1.95 billion to be precise) from this deal. So what does this all mean for shareholders? Let's find out."", 'In this initial deal, Greece intends to purchase 35 Black Hawks from Lockheed, along with 80 engines to power them (two per helicopter, plus 10 spares), and a whole list of ancillary equipment (radar, radios, and other electronics, machine guns, rocket launchers, and ammunition, for example). Thus, multiple defense contractors are likely to share in the revenue from this deal -- but as primary contractor, all the money will run through Lockheed Martin.', ""Greece intends to use the new helicopters to replace the Hellenic Army's current multi-role helicopter fleet, which, according to data from FlightGlobal's 2024 World Air Forces report, leans heavily on 63 UH-1H Huey helicopters built by Textron's (NYSE: TXT) Bell Helicopter unit."", 'And that number may be instructive. Can 35 Black Hawks actually do the work of nearly twice as many Hueys? Perhaps, if the new Black Hawks are easier to maintain and require fewer repairs than the older Hueys they replace. But also perhaps not.', ""As it turns out, an October report from online news site FlightGlobal noted that Greece initially intended to purchase 49 Black Hawks from Lockheed. If it turns out that this remains Greece's intention, and the initial 35-helo purchase is just a first installment on Greece's shopping list, this deal could actually turn out to be about 40% bigger than it seems -- implying Lockheed Martin might get another $780 million in revenue out of it, growing the size of this deal to $2.7 billion."", ""What would that mean for Lockheed Martin? Rotary and mission systems, the Lockheed unit that owns Sikorsky and builds the Black Hawk, is currently the company's second-biggest revenue producer at $18.1 billion collected in 2022 (the most recent full year for which we have data). Rotary is the company's second to last most profitable segment, however, generating operating profit margins of only 9.2%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, a bit below the 10.5% operating profit margin for Lockheed Martin as a whole."", ""Thus, even at the upper end of its estimated value, this deal will only add about $250 million in incremental profits for Lockheed Martin, or about 3% of Lockheed's total annual take -- and this amount will probably be spread over a period of years. Thus, even at $2.7 billion, this deal isn't going to be enough to move the needle on Lockheed Martin stock, which still seems pricey to me at nearly 17 times earnings, and 1.7 times annual sales."", '(As a general rule, I prefer to buy defense stocks at a price-to-sales ratio of 1 or less.)', ""Curiously, defense investors might actually be better off taking a look at Textron, the company whose helicopters are being replaced (in Greece at least) by Lockheed's helicopters."", ""Seemingly priced similarly to Lockheed stock at 17 times trailing earnings, Textron's price-to-sales ratio of 1.2 seems closer to fair value. Analysts polled by S&P also anticipate that Textron will grow earnings faster than Lockheed over the next five years, at a rate approaching 12%, versus Lockheed Martin's growth rate of 7%."", 'While neither stock is a clear-cut buy for me at current prices, I suspect Textron stock is still closer to bargain territory than is Lockheed.

Similarly, a stock isn't just a good value because its stock price is down or its earnings are better than the market gives it credit for, but rather because the company has what it takes to continue growing the business over time and supporting shareholder programs like dividends and buybacks."", 'For example, Warren Buffett is seen as a value investor at heart. But long gone are the days of Buffett picking ""cigar-butt"" troubled businesses whose assets may be worth more than the market is giving it credit for. Today, top Warren Buffet stocks include strong brands like Apple, which trades at a premium to the market. Again, the value isn\'t purely derived from what Apple is worth right now relative to the last 12 months of earnings, but what Apple can continue to produce in the future.', 'Three Motley Fool contributors were asked to discuss potential value stock picks this year. Below, they offer details on why Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Johnson Controls International (NYSE: JCI), and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP)(NYSE: BIPC) are three excellent value stocks to buy in 2024.', ""Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Coke's 24.2 price-to-earnings ratio looks expensive at first glance. But there's a reason why the soda leader tends to trade at a premium to the rest of the market."", 'There are few companies that investors can count on more during a market sell-off than Coca-Cola. The company has raised its dividend every year for over 60 years. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences and is no longer solely dependent on soft drinks. The expansion of its portfolio, geographically and in terms of energy drinks, tea, coffee, and other beverages, has given Coke a wider moat and pricing power.', ""Over the last three years, Coke has grown sales by 36.4%, which is impressive for a company of its size and in a generally slow to moderate growth industry. A good metric for evaluating a company's balance sheet and ability to invest in profitable projects is return on invested capital (ROIC). Coke's ROIC is near a 10-year high and far higher than its 10-year median of 11 -- which illustrates that Coke is achieving responsible growth."", ""Coke's efficient use of capital and successful acquisitions in recent years bolster the long-term investment thesis. With a dividend yield of 3.1% and a reasonable valuation, Coke looks like the perfect value stock for risk-averse investors to scoop up in January."", ""Lee Samaha (Johnson Controls): Despite a disappointing set of fourth-quarter results and guidance, Johnson Controls still looks like an excellent value option. It's not that the company isn't growing or that it operates in unattractive markets. Instead, the company's problem is that its growth isn't quite what management expected it to be in its fiscal 2023."", ""Still, management's guidance calls for mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2024, and the midpoint of its earnings-per-share guidance of $3.65 to $3.80 puts it on about 15 times 2024 earnings and around 18 times free cash flow."", ""Its valuation metrics look good, and recall that it only expects to convert FCF from net income at an 85% rate in 2024 to reach 100% conversion over time. In other words, there's upside potential to its FCF generation that doesn't just depend in earnings growth."", ""Growth came in lower than expected due to the negative impact of a cyber attack and slower sales in its global products (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, building controls, and fire and safety equipment) segment. These products are sold through dealers currently running down inventory built after a period when product was more problematic to secure quickly. That's something slowing Johnson Controls' sales growth."", 'Management believes it will work through the impact of the cyber attack and the inventory restocking in 2023 and the 9% growth in orders and backlog in the fourth quarter in its building solutions (design, servicing, and installation of equipment) business is a sign of a buoyant underlying market.', 'As such, it makes sense to give management the benefit of the doubt, making Johnson Controls an attractive stock to buy.', 'A high-yield distribution and low price tag make Brookfield Infrastructure look like a great addition for 2024.', ""Scott Levine (Brookfield Infrastructure): Forget the travel mugs, gift cards, and new pairs of socks you received this past holiday season. It's time to treat yourself with something for you and your portfolio -- a gift that'll keep on giving for the foreseeable future. Operating a vast portfolio of utilities, transportation, and energy assets (among others), Brookfield Infrastructure is a leading infrastructure stock that rewards investors with a consistently growing distribution -- one that currently offers an enticing 4.3% forward yield. And if the holiday season has you pinching the pursestrings, there's no need to worry. Shares of Brookfield Infrastructure are currently sitting in the bargain bin, trading at 4.7 times trailing earnings."", 'After taking a cursory glance at Brookfield Infrastructure\'s stock, cautious investors may see the stock\'s 9.3% drop in 2023 as a warning sign. But take a longer look, and you\'ll find the absence of any red flags. Instead, it seems that high interest rates have spooked investors into thinking that the company will have trouble selling off assets. Management acknowledged this on the Q3 2023 letter to unitholders, stating, ""The higher rate environment has positively influenced our ability to buy for value, while admittedly making it moderately more challenging to monetize assets."" It\'s important to remember, though, that high interest rates won\'t last forever, and a ""challenging"" high interest rate environment doesn\'t, in and of itself, spell doom for the company.', ""For Brookfield Infrastructure, one of the most important metrics to monitor is the company's funds from operations (FFO). Strong FFO growth ensures that the company will be able reward investors with a growing distribution that doesn't jeopardize its financial well-being. Through the first nine months of 2023, Brookfield Infrastructure has reported FFO per unit of $2.16 (an 8.5% year-over-year increase) while it has paid out $1.15 in dividends."", 'Over the past 10 years, Brookfield Infrastructure has increased its distribution at an 8% compound annual growth rate, and it is targeting continued annual distribution growth of 5% to 9%. For those looking for steadily growing passive income, Brookfield Infrastructure is a great option.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

As is usually the case, not every component in Berkshire's $359 billion equity portfolio participated in the rally. There were a couple of stocks that finished the year significantly lower."", ""Buffett completely removed seven stocks from Berkshire's portfolio in the third quarter, but these two were allowed to remain despite underperforming. This suggests that he believes they have a bright future."", ""Here's a closer look at both beaten-down stocks to see if they could be bargains now."", ""Shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX) fell hard in October after the company reported third-quarter revenue that was 18.3% lower year over year. The drop was largely due to lower commodity prices and a poor reaction to management's aggressive plans for expansion through acquisition. It didn't help that Berkshire Hathaway steadily trimmed its Chevron position by about one-third beginning in late 2022."", 'At their reduced price, shares of Chevron offer a nice 3.9% dividend yield. The company has been able to raise its payout by 26.9% over the past five years, and future raises seem highly likely. The company met its dividend commitment with just 55% of the free cash flow its operations generated over the past 12 months.', ""Buffett likes oil and gas stocks because markets consistently overreact to the cyclical industry's peaks and troughs. He is a particular fan of Chevron because its assets can produce strong positive cash flow even when oil prices fall."", 'Shares of Chevron have been trading for just 11.2 times trailing-12-month earnings. That looks like a bargain when you consider the average stock in the S&P 500 index has been trading at 21.6 times trailing earnings.', 'With new cuts to supply from OPEC likely to raise oil prices in 2024, buying the stock now to hold for the long run looks like the right move.', ""Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) stock price tanked last fall but recovered enough to limit its loss to just 4.8% in 2023. At recent prices, it offers a 3.1% yield, and investors who buy now can reasonably expect its dividend to keep rising. Last February, the company raised its quarterly payout for the 61st year in a row."", 'Buffett loves Coca-Cola because it sells some of the most recognized brands on the planet, giving it the pricing power it needs to steadily increase profits.', 'For example, North American case volume was flat during the first nine months of 2023, but price increases raised net revenue for this important geographical segment by 8% year over year.', ""The giant international supermarket chain Carrefour\xa0recently started pulling PepsiCo products in response to price hikes. So far, it hasn't complained about Coca-Cola."", 'Volumes in North America have held steady, and Coca-Cola products are still increasingly popular in Latin America, where reported net revenue surged 24% year over year.', ""Over the next few years, Coca-Cola shouldn't have any trouble raising its dividend in line with overall profit growth. The company generated $10.2 billion in free cash flow during the 12 months that ended Sept. 30. Over the same time frame, dividend payments chewed up 77% of the free cash flow that operations generated."", ""I wouldn't say that Coca-Cola shares are trading at bargain prices, but they aren't prohibitively expensive, either. You can buy the stock for 25.5 times trailing free cash flow or 21.3 times forward earnings expectations. It probably won't be the top performer in your portfolio, but adding some shares now will more than likely lead to positive returns and heaps of dividend income over time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them.

Some examples include finding one or two under-the-radar stocks today that will deliver explosive growth tomorrow, or filling your portfolio with companies forging the way in the hottest areas, from artificial intelligence (AI) to gene editing -- and forgetting about the ""boring"" companies that have been around for years.', ""But those techniques actually won't put you on the path to long-term success. Of course, it's great to add a few under-the-radar stocks to your portfolio, and companies leading the way in new technologies could make compelling buys too. But investing success generally doesn't happen overnight or come from buying only one or two stocks or involve investing only in hot areas."", ""And this actually is fantastic news, because you don't have to jump through many hoops to become a standout investor -- in fact, you just have to be average. What does that mean? Let's take a closer look."", ""By being average, I mean a few things. You can focus your investments on a core selection of companies that you probably know well just through your daily routine. You don't have to start off with an enormous amount of money to build your portfolio. And finally, you don't have to move in and out of positions frequently according to what economic news or technical analysis charts show."", ""So, for example, you could buy some very well-known companies such as the five in the chart. As you can see, they've all delivered double-digit or triple-digit gains over the past decade."", ""Two of them, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), also offer you a solid track record of dividend growth. As Dividend Kings, these companies have increased their payments annually for more than 50 years. These stocks' total return, which includes dividend payments, shows dividends have added significantly to your gains in them over time -- bringing the increase into the triple digits."", ""These companies I've selected in these two charts haven't delivered enormous gains overnight, but instead have progressively increased over time."", ""You would have gained more in a short time period if you'd invested in an early hopeful in the coronavirus vaccine race, such as Novavax\xa0or even vaccine market leader Moderna -- but those increases haven't lasted."", ""This doesn't mean you shouldn't buy shares of companies that may take off due to a hot trend. But if you do, do so with caution, and always as part of a diversified portfolio -- filled with steady stocks that have proven themselves over time."", ""Now let's talk money. You don't have to invest a fortune today to score a stock market win. Invest what you can afford, and ideally, commit to adding to your portfolio monthly."", 'Fractional shares offer you the opportunity to get in on top companies even if your budget is limited. And the effect of compounding should grow your investment in a stock over the long haul.', ""Finally, choose stocks with great long-term prospects and hang on to them for a decade -- or longer. There's no need to jump in and out of positions on a daily basis to succeed in the stock market. You're more likely to benefit from a company's growth over time and its long-term stock performance than to select just the right stock and enter and exit the position at the perfect moment. The former is the reality of life as an average investor, while the idea of making millions on just one move is an uncommon event -- like winning the lottery."", ""Sure, it's exciting to imagine your portfolio soaring overnight on one perfect stock pick, but what's even more exciting is you don't have to hope and wish for that to happen.

Structured as companies that own or finance income-producing real estate often across a range of property categories, acquiring a quality REIT can be a sensible idea. Further, possible shifting tides in 2024 arguably enhance the opportunity.', 'For one thing, the much-anticipated recession that Wall Street feared last year simply didn’t materialize. That’s not to say that economy skipped to a happy beat. However, circumstances could have been much worse. By avoiding a devastating bullet, both consumers and investors may feel more confident. And that could benefit certain REITs to buy.', 'Second and most importantly, the Federal Reserve has hinted at the possibility of interest rate cuts this year. Nothing is set in stone and circumstances could change. But it also represents a clear pivot from the earlier hawkish stance.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'If dovishness does ultimately reign supreme, these are the top REITs to buy.', 'Source: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com', 'A diversified net-lease REIT, W.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) primarily invests in single-tenant properties whereby the tenant is responsible for most of the associated operating expenses. That includes property tax, insurance, and maintenance. It covers several property types, most notably industrial and warehouse. Also, it features significant exposure to retail businesses, such as grocery outlets and drugstores.', 'Fundamentally, WPC might benefit from the possible consumer sentiment boost tied to reduced interest rates. Consider that during the holidays, many folks continued to open their wallets. It’s just that the mechanism for payment – using buy now, pay later (BNPL) platforms – changed. Presumably, then, reducing the onerous obstacle of high interest rates should boost spending.', 'The thesis also makes sense because the labor market has been surprisingly robust. So again, any obstacles challenging spending being mitigated should make WPC one of the top REITs to buy. To sweeten the pot, shares trade at only 11.21X funds from operations (FFO), lower than the sector median 13.45X.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock', 'A timberland company, Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) owns nearly 12.4 million acres of timberlands in the U.S. Further, its public profile states that the enterprise manages an additional 14 million acres under long-term licenses in Canada. Notably, it’s been in business since 1900. So, from a dependability standpoint, WY presents a great candidacy for top REITs to buy.', 'As for the underlying forestry and logging business, the sector’s market valuation reached $322.25 billion globally. By 2028, the segment should hit $437.39 billion. If so, that would come out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%. What’s more, lower interest rates could potentially help boost the timberlands industry. For example, greater financing accessibility for residential real estate could lift demand for wood products.', 'To be sure, with a price-to-FFO ratio of 21X, WY doesn’t necessarily offer a discount. However, it features strong revenue and EBITDA growth. Plus, analysts rate shares as a consensus moderate buy, making it worth a second look.', 'Source: mTaira / Shutterstock.com', 'While I could go with a bread-and-butter idea for top REITs to buy to finish off this list, I’ve made the decision to go the speculative route with Tanger (NYSE:SKT). A REIT focused on shopping centers, Tanger enjoyed a significant rise in the second half of 2023, gaining over 25% of equity value. For the year, SKT moved up almost 57%.', 'Naturally, SKT raises concerns about holding the bag. Conspicuously, analysts rate shares a consensus hold with a $24.60 average price target. That translates to more than 11% downside risk. If you’re looking for a confidence booster SKT doesn’t quite fit the bill. However, the possible monetary policy pivot could favor the REIT.', 'As stated earlier, consumers continued to spend during the holidays. However, some data exists that suggests rising prudence during the difficulties last year. Notably, the personal saving rate increased from 3.3% in November 2022 to 4.1% in November 2023. This might indicate greater breadth for discretionary spending. If so, SKT could be one of the top REITs.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The gross margin expansion also bodes well.', 'Macroeconomic Instability: Accuray’s business is materially affected by global market conditions and the overall economy. Concerns over economic and political stability have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To start with, Cincinnati Financial's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Despite this, Cincinnati Financial's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""As a next step, we compared Cincinnati Financial's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the industry saw an average growth of 9.0% in the same period."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CINF?

', ""Cincinnati Financial has a low three-year median payout ratio of 20% (or a retention ratio of 80%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention."", ""Moreover, Cincinnati Financial has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 49% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 9.0% over the same period."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Cincinnati Financial has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Additionally, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that analysts expect the company's earnings to continue to shrink in the future.

NFLX.', 'Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:', 'Wall Street had a dream run in 2023 reversing the nightmare of 2022. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — were up 13.7%, 23.9% and 43.4%, respectively. In 2022, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 8.8%, 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.', 'However, market participants remain concerned about whether the U.S. stock market bull run will continue in 2024. The first three trading days of this year have witnessed significant volatility and a sharp decline in all three major stock indexes. Investors are uncertain as to when the first rate cut will materialize.', ""The impressive bull run is set to continue in 2024. The Fed's December FOMC meeting minutes clearly indicate a sizable percentage of cut in the benchmark interest rate this year. A rate hike is a remote possibility as the majority of FOMC members want to see the full effect of existing interest rate range of 5.25-5.5%. The inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022."", 'A lower interest rate regime will boost economic growth speeding up investment by businesses. In 2022, small-cap companies suffered from record-high inflation, a soaring interest rate and fear of an impending recession. However, in 2023, this segment of the economy found some relief from these three concerns. The rate cut will further boost mid and small-sized enterprises.', 'A lower interest rate regime will be beneficial high-growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. Several companies in these spaces depend on cheap source of credit as the full potential of their business is realized over a long period. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate thereby increasing the net present value of investment in these stocks.', ""The global supply-chain system has been restoring slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system's bypassing of China. Moreover, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record high-inflation and interest rate. The latest report of the Atlanta Fed projected that the U.S. GDP would grow 2% in fourth-quarter 2023."", 'Finally, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5%. A systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets.', 'Market participants are surprised to see such an impressive bull run in 2023. Consequently, a large section of investors has already said that U.S. stock markets will remain muted in 2024 as valuation is stretched.', 'At this stage, investors should wait for a proper time to enter the market. The long-term trend of Wall Street is very much bullish. However, markets are likely to fluctuate in the short-term due to profit booking on stretched valuation or unforeseen external disturbances like geopolitical conflicts or erratic behavior of energy prices.', 'In this regard, every dip will be a good buying opportunity even for those stocks that have skyrocketed in 2023 and have strong potential for 2024 and beyond. Investors sometimes invest in overbought stocks due to the FOMO (fear of missing out) factor. Instead, they should apply a SIP (systematic investment plan) strategy.', 'Select bold stocks, especially stocks of those companies that are market leader in their respective sectors. Use every dip in these stock prices to form a formidable portfolio over a period of time. At the end of the year, this portfolio is likely to beat average market returns.', 'At this stage, several stocks look attractive for future growth.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Estée Lauder Companies is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.072 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$23b - US$5.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 7.2%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Personal Products industry average of 14%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Estée Lauder Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""When we looked at the ROCE trend at Estée Lauder Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 26% over the last five years. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased."", ""From the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for Estée Lauder Companies have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 15% in the last five years. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere."", ""One final note, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Estée Lauder Companies (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) ."", ""While Estée Lauder Companies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

But in reality, many games are simultaneously played in the same arena."", 'Income investing is a unique way of being involved in the stock market. Instead of using capital gains (buying a stock and selling it for a higher price) as the primary driver of returns, the focus is on income from dividends. Income investors may ignore popular stocks in favor of stodgy dividend-paying companies that return most of their earnings directly to investors.', ""However, income investors often make one big mistake. Here's what it is and how to avoid it."", ""If you're not an income investor, you may be wondering why folks do it in the first place. After all, the average annual return of the S&P 500 is around 9% or 10%. So why buy a dividend-paying company with a 5% yield?"", 'The primary reason is that income investors are risk-averse or focus more on capital preservation than capital appreciation. The S&P 500 has an attractive average return. But it can do just about anything in the short term.', ""After the financial crisis of 2008, it took the S&P 500 about six years to recover to its previous high, reached in 2007. If you had the patience and conviction to hold through that period, it was worth it. But many investors don't have the time horizon or temperament to do that. It sounds easy in hindsight. But those who have been through bear markets know how difficult it can be to see the light at the end of the tunnel when equity prices are crashing all around you."", ""Quality dividend stocks, like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), have recession-resistant business models and tend to outperform a bear market. They also have over 60 years of consecutive dividend raises. However, they don't have the growth prospects of many smaller companies in other sectors. For that reason, they tend to underperform a strong year in the market, which is exactly what happened in 2023."", 'Unfortunately, investors can pass on quality companies and fall prey to a higher yield. A perfect recent example is what happened last week with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).', ""Walgreens reported its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan. 4. But all eyes were on Walgreens' 48% dividend cut."", ""Prior to the cut, Walgreens had a yield of around 8% -- making it one of the highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 and the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But Walgreens wasn't supporting its dividend with earnings."", ""The biggest mistake income investors make is looking at the size of a company's dividend or how long it's been paying the dividend, instead of looking at how the business is doing and whether it can support future dividend growth. After all, what good is a high yield if the stock's going down and the quality of the underlying business is deteriorating?"", 'Another example is Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). Unlike Walgreens, Costco has been a market darling stock -- a true outperformer and an industry leader. But Costco has a bizarre dividend program. It pays a relatively small ordinary dividend. Then, every few years, once it accumulates enough cash on the balance sheet, it pays an unusually large one-time special dividend.', 'Costco recently announced a $15 per share special dividend. The special dividend ""feels"" great, certainly better than a regularly scheduled ordinary dividend. But it doesn\'t happen all the time, it isn\'t guaranteed, and it\'s uncertain how large it will be.', ""In fact, even when factoring in the special dividend, Costco won't even yield as much as Target in 2024."", ""Again, we have an example of an income opportunity that sounds great at first glance. But in reality, it's a bit misleading."", 'Income investing centers around predictability and is often a way to supplement income in retirement. An unsustainable high yield (Walgreens) or a company that sometimes pays special dividends (Costco) misses that objective.', ""Before approaching a potential income stock, you'll first want to make sure that the business itself is one worth owning. Next, you'll want to look at metrics like the payout ratio, which is the amount of earnings that are being used to pay the dividend. Look at free cash flow, and whether it's high enough to support the dividend."", ""After that, consider whether there are other ways a company returns value to shareholders. In the case of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the dividend yield is only 0.5%. But that's because Apple doesn't focus solely on dividend raises. Instead, it's famous for supporting a massive stock repurchase program, which helps reduce the outstanding share count and makes the stock a better value over time."", ""Extremely risk-averse, income-oriented investors may prefer a company that doesn't do any buybacks and focuses solely on the dividend.

Last year, however, Buffett didn't beat the market."", ""That doesn't mean he didn't have some big winners in Berkshire's portfolio, though. There's one stock in particular that Buffett bought in mid-2023 that he probably wishes he had purchased sooner."", ""Buffett didn't buy many stocks last year. Actually, he was a net seller during the year. However, he really liked one group of stocks."", 'In the second quarter, the legendary investor initiated new positions for Berkshire in three homebuilders. His biggest stake of the three was and is in D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI).', 'D.R. Horton ranks as the largest homebuilder by volume in the U.S. It has held that distinction since 2002. The company operates in 118 markets in 33 states, typically building homes ranging in price from $200,000 to over $1 million. It also builds single-family and multifamily rental properties.', ""Buffett only buys a stock when it passes a two-step test. First, he must be able to reasonably estimate the future earnings over the next five years or more. Second, the stock's valuation must look attractive compared to the lower end of the projected earnings range. D.R. Horton obviously passed this test, since Berkshire scooped up nearly 6 million shares."", ""We don't know exactly how big of a gain D.R. Horton delivered for Buffett last year because we don't know exactly when he bought the stock. However, had the homebuilder been in Berkshire's portfolio for the full year, it would have been the conglomerate's second-best stock of 2023. Only Amazon generated a greater gain."", 'In D.R. Horton\'s third-quarter earnings conference call, CEO David Auld said, ""Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 37% from the prior-year quarter, as the supply of both new homes and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable."" The good news for the company is that the headwinds Auld mentioned probably won\'t be as problematic in 2024.', ""Mortgage rates have already come down somewhat since D.R. Horton's Q3 call. The Federal Reserve has also indicated that interest rate cuts could be on the way later this year. If so, mortgage rates should decline even further."", ""Inflation is also moderating. The Fed predicts that the core personal consumption expenditures price index will fall to 2.4% in 2024, much better than the inflation levels we've seen over the last couple of years."", ""The supply-demand imbalance that Auld referenced hasn't been resolved, either. An analysis published by Bank of America in the fall of 2023 estimated that the U.S. has a shortage of around 4 million homes. In December, another BofA report revealed that fewer prospective homebuyers are willing to wait for a better market environment to buy a new home."", 'All these factors point to strong demand for the homes that D.R. Horton will build. And that number is likely to grow in 2024. Auld stated in the Q3 call that his company plans to incrementally increase how many new homes it begins building each quarter.', ""After shares skyrocketed 70% last year, though, you might think that D.R. Horton could be too expensive, even with its tremendous growth prospects. That's not the case. The stock trades at only 11.2 times expected earnings. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is an exceptionally low 0.64."", ""I wouldn't be the farm on D.R. Horton rising as much in 2024 as it did last year. However, this Buffett stock is still a no-brainer buy, in my view."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in D.r. Horton right now?', 'Before you buy stock in D.r.

With its outstanding 56 consecutive years of dividend increases, weathering various recessions and economic challenges, the retail REIT has earned its place in the sector’s spotlight. Still, in the face of impending rate cuts, investors may be overrating the stock. Given the availability of more attractive income-producing choices among REITS, I am neutral on FRT.', 'Federal Realty stands out as a premier choice for income-focused investors, backed by an unparalleled track record of more than half a century of dividend growth. Investors place their trust in Federal Realty with good reason – no other REIT comes close to matching its exceptional history of dividend growth.', 'To put it into perspective, the nearest competitors in this regard, Universal Health Realty Income Trust (NYSE:UHT), NNN REIT (NYSE:NNN), and Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS), trail behind with track records of 39, 34, and 29 years, respectively – a significant gap compared to FRT’s impressive performance.', 'The company’s success in achieving this remarkable feat can be attributed to strategic investments in highly-resilient properties. These properties consistently generate stable income, even during the most challenging economic environments. Specifically, Federal Realty owns 102 open-air retail hub properties strategically located in first-ring suburbs within high-barrier markets.', 'Operating in key metropolitan areas such as Boston, Silicon Valley, and Miami, where the average household income exceeds $150,000, the company thrives on robust consumer spending. This, in turn, attracts high-quality retail tenants, resulting in strong leasing outcomes for Federal Realty – a trend that has historically persisted even during unfavorable market conditions.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic makes for a great example, as it posed a unique challenge to retail REITs, which grappled with many retailers temporarily suspending their operations. However, Federal Realty’s portfolio of open-air properties demonstrated resilience and continued to deliver positive results. This allowed the company to maintain its track record of dividend increases.', 'Further, Federal Realty is projected to achieve funds from operations (FFO, a cash-flow metric used by REITs) per share of $6.55 this year, surpassing its pre-pandemic (FY2019) FFO/share result of $6.33. I believe this is particularly commendable, given the backdrop of a rising-interest-rate environment that has notably compressed the profitability of most companies operating in the real estate sector recently.', 'While FRT has become a favored choice among income-oriented investors eyeing retail REITs, I contend that the industry has superior dividend options. This view is grounded in two primary factors: FRT’s valuation appears steep, driven by investors’ willingness to pay a premium for the stock, and the company’s unimpressive pace of dividend growth.', 'Examining FRT’s valuation, the stock trades at approximately 16 times this year’s expected FFO/share, suggesting a premium multiple. This seems particularly unjustified, given the relatively subdued growth prospects of the company. Despite the resilience of FRT’s properties in generating consistent cash flows, the strategic choice of signing long-term leases for stability has sacrificed potential growth.', 'Sure, the company is expected to post record FFO/share this year. However, the $6.55 estimate for FY2023 implies a 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.62% from 2013’s FFO/share of $4.61. That’s a very weak growth rate, in my view. Wall Street analysts expect this trend to persist, forecasting FFO/share growth in the mid-single digits in the coming years.', 'At the same time, the stock’s yield stands at a mere 4.26%. Let’s compare this with some other industry-leading retail REITs: Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) trades at a forward P/FFO of 11.8 (based on full-year 2023 estimates) and yields 5.3%. Realty Income (NYSE:O) trades at a forward P/FFO of 14.2 and yields 5.3% as well. NNN REIT (NYSE:NNN) trades at a forward P/FFO of 13.5 and yields 5.2%.', 'Clearly, investors have been willing to pay a premium for the stock due to its legendary status in the industry. However, this overvaluation, which also comes at the expense of a below-average yield, could suppress shareholder returns over the long run.', 'Furthermore, despite FRT’s extended track record of dividend growth, the pace of this growth has been disappointingly slow. Management has opted for conservative dividend hikes to maintain a healthy payout ratio and safely sustain annual dividend increases. Thus, the company’s five-year dividend CAGR has slowed dramatically in recent years, at just 1.5%. It’s notably below inflation rates, too.', 'Consequently, despite the reliability of FRT’s dividend growth, the relative weakness of the dividend in terms of the yield/dividend growth relationship raises concerns about its long-term attractiveness to shareholders.', 'Checking Wall Street’s sentiment on the stock, Federal Realty currently boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. At $108.30, the\xa0average FRT stock forecast implies\xa05.9% upside potential.', 'In conclusion, Federal Realty has undeniably earned its reputation as a dividend powerhouse, boasting an unrivaled track record of 56 consecutive years of increases. Its resilience during economic challenges, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, speaks to the strength of its property portfolio.', 'However, given the stock’s premium valuation, unimpressive dividend growth pace, and the availability of more attractive options in the retail REIT sector, including some of the other names I mentioned, I hold a neutral stance on FRT.', 'Disclosure']"

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. One great example is The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) which saw its share price drive 124% higher over five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 17% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 8.5% in the last three months."", ""Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.9%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price."", ' View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.3% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Sherwin-Williams' earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Sherwin-Williams, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""It's good to see that Sherwin-Williams has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 27% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 19% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently.
