In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 23%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 98%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", ""All in all, it's terrific to see that Nucor is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 238% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth of 19% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Microchip Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'According to our valuation model, Microchip Technology seems to be fairly priced at around 4.21% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microchip Technology today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $80.60, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Microchip Technology’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Microchip Technology, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -1.6%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.', 'Are you a shareholder? MCHP seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MCHP for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on MCHP should the price fluctuate below its true value.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

They say Drax’s clear-cutting of forests in North America destroys the environment rather than supporting it.', 'Next week, however, Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho is expected to secure Drax’s future by approving a scheme to bolt two massive carbon capture plants onto Drax’s four generating units, potentially stripping out almost all their CO2 emissions.', 'Drax claims the scheme will allow it to remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than it produces – making it the world’s first carbon negative thermal power station. Greens claim it will destroy forests and cost consumers billions of pounds.', 'Ms Coutinho is also due to launch a consultation into how best to extend the subsidy system under which Drax last year received £617m from consumer bills. The scheme terminates in 2027 so Coutinho will propose extending it into at least the 2030s, keeping Drax in business for at least several years.', 'UK energy policy is fast becoming one of the hottest political pre-election issues. On Friday Chris Skidmore, a former energy minister, resigned the Conservative whip and stood down as an MP over separate legislation promoting North Sea oil and gas exploration.', 'Schemes like Drax’s, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or Beccs, are highly controversial – green groups argue that cutting down forests to generate electricity destroys the environment rather than protecting it.', 'However, the UK government has repeatedly supported the idea, suggesting it will become one of the key technologies enabling the UK to reach net zero.', 'Its net zero strategy report argues that: “When coupled with carbon capture and storage, it is possible that sustainable biomass can not only enable production of low carbon fuels but could also deliver vital negative emissions.”', 'Will Gardiner, chief executive of Drax Group, said: “Beccs is the only credible large-scale technology that can generate secure renewable power and deliver carbon removals.', '“Our Beccs plans in North Yorkshire would create one of the world’s largest engineered carbon removals projects and put the Humber and the UK on the map as the global centre of Beccs development.”', 'Drax produces about 4pc of the UK’s electricity so ministers are keen to protect it on energy security grounds too.', 'The idea underpinning Beccs schemes is that as plants and trees grow they capture CO2 from the air via photosynthesis.', 'If they are burned then that CO2 is released back into the air so there is no overall loss or gain. This means wood-burning on its own can be described as “low carbon”.', 'However, if the CO2 from burning wood is captured and permanently buried underground, as Drax proposes, then the process actually removes CO2 from the atmosphere permanently. This would make it “carbon negative”.', 'Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the REA (Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology), said: “Future energy scenarios, whether from the Committee on Climate Change, the IPCC or the International Energy Agency, all identify a critical role for Beccs in delivering carbon removals in order to enable the UK, and the rest of world, meet its net zero ambitions by 2050.', '“Utilising sustainable biomass with Beccs has the unique benefit of producing both low-carbon power and negative emissions.”', 'Such claims infuriate environmentalists and Drax’s plans have been opposed by Friends of the Earth, Client Earth and Ember. They say that despite changing from coal to wood Drax remains the UK’s largest single source of CO2 emissions at more than 13 million tonnes a year.', 'Tomos Harrison, an analyst at global energy think tank Ember, said: “UK energy bill-payers have already paid billions to Drax to burn wood for electricity, a practice which is unlikely to reduce the UK’s contribution to climate change and could actually be increasing it.', '“Beccs is an unproven and controversial technology that cannot be guaranteed to deliver negative emissions and will cost bill-payers even more.', '“Instead of continuing support for wood-burning in the UK we should be investing in wind and solar which bring down energy bills and make a genuine positive contribution to the UK’s climate change efforts.”', 'A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said: “Biomass plays a key role in delivering a more secure, clean energy sector in Britain.', '“Capturing emissions from this process can remove significant volumes of CO2 from the atmosphere and support our Net Zero ambitions. We will be consulting on the proposals in due course.”', 'Mr Gardiner said: “We plan to invest billions in developing two Beccs units at Drax Power Station which could create up to 10,000 new jobs at the peak of construction.', 'The UK government wants to deploy five million tonnes of carbon removals by 2030, we believe this can only be achieved through building Beccs at Drax Power Station.”', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Bitcoin mining stock Riot Platforms\xa0(NASDAQ: RIOT), for example, is now up more than 300% during the past 12 months, making it one of the best-performing growth stocks of the past year.', ""But it could be a different story in 2024, due to important changes coming to Bitcoin within the next few months. Here's a closer look at the key factors that could affect the price of Riot Platforms in the year ahead."", 'It might sound obvious, but Bitcoin mining stocks are highly correlated with the price of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin mining stocks go up. And vice versa. That makes sense, since a rising price for Bitcoin makes every new Bitcoin mined more valuable.', ""Right now, Riot Platforms is one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, and holds more than $300 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. So it's easy to see why Riot Platforms soared in the past 12 months -- the stock is extremely leveraged to the price of Bitcoin."", 'But, as crypto investors know, the price of Bitcoin is very cyclical. Long bull market rallies are followed by long bear market declines, and the cycle then repeats. Investors saw evidence of this during the past few years: A bull market rally that sent the price of Bitcoin soaring to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021 was then followed by crypto winter in 2022 and a wrenching shakeout in the crypto industry. And then, in 2023, there were signs that the next bull market rally for Bitcoin was coming.', ""This cyclical nature of Bitcoin means that Bitcoin mining stocks are also highly cyclical. So that's one big reason some investors think that Riot Platforms could run out of steam in 2024. Unless the price of Bitcoin continues its dizzying ascent this year, Bitcoin mining stocks such as Riot Platforms could easily fall out of favor with investors."", 'A primary reason for this cyclical nature of Bitcoin involves the halving, an event that takes place only once every four years. In a halving, the reward paid out to Bitcoin miners for mining a single block on the Bitcoin blockchain falls by half. This is all determined algorithmically, and cannot be changed.', 'So what will happen to Bitcoin miners in the aftermath of the next halving, which is now scheduled for April 2024? If no attempt is made to bring online extra mining capacity and the price of Bitcoin does not increase, Bitcoin miners such as Riot Platforms could make half as much money as they did last year, simply due to the economic impact of the halving. In fact, unless the price of Bitcoin doubles, miner financial results will suffer.', 'For that reason, some are expecting a big shakeout in the Bitcoin mining industry in 2024. The smallest and least-efficient Bitcoin miners could be at greatest risk. At the very least, the Bitcoin miners that have not been investing in new Bitcoin mining rigs will be at a serious disadvantage.', ""That's one reason to be bullish on Riot Platforms. The company has been ramping up its fleet of mining rigs ahead of the halving. With all of this new mining capacity, Riot Platforms may be able to offset the fact that its mining rewards are being cut in half."", ""With the caveat that past performance is no guarantee of future results, it's interesting to take a quick look at how Riot Platforms performed during the last Bitcoin halving, which took place in May 2020.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.

Greens claim it will destroy forests and cost consumers billions of pounds.', 'Ms Coutinho is also due to launch a consultation into how best to extend the subsidy system under which Drax last year received £617m from consumer bills.

This means wood-burning on its own can be described as “low carbon”.', 'However, if the CO2 from burning wood is captured and permanently buried underground, as Drax proposes, then the process actually removes CO2 from the atmosphere permanently. This would make it “carbon negative”.', 'Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the REA (Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology), said: “Future energy scenarios, whether from the Committee on Climate Change, the IPCC or the International Energy Agency, all identify a critical role for Beccs in delivering carbon removals in order to enable the UK, and the rest of world, meet its net zero ambitions by 2050.', '“Utilising sustainable biomass with Beccs has the unique benefit of producing both low-carbon power and negative emissions.”', 'Such claims infuriate environmentalists and Drax’s plans have been opposed by Friends of the Earth, Client Earth and Ember.

These figures come from Statcounter and should be interpreted as ballpark estimates, but it's clear that Windows reigns supreme."", ""While Windows remains dominant, it has lost some of that dominance over time.

That's still tiny compared to Windows, but a fivefold increase is notable, nonetheless."", ""While the odds have always been stacked against Linux in the battle for OS supremacy, a fairly recent development could pave the way for further erosion of Microsoft's market share."", 'While Linux distributions have become more user-friendly over time, with some even doing a pretty good job of mimicking the Windows experience, they still require a level of technical know-how that is beyond the typical PC user. Linux is extremely popular among software developers, with around 45% of developers reporting Linux as their preferred OS. But most PC users are not writing code or doing anything more technical than the occasional spreadsheet.', ""For users who are tech-savvy enough to use Linux but don't, one reason for sticking with Windows is the state of the PC gaming industry. Because Windows dominates in terms of market share, PC games are often developed for Windows exclusively. Going through the trouble of porting a game to Linux rarely makes commercial sense, given its minuscule market share."", 'Steam, the leading PC gaming platform, recently published a list of the top-grossing games of 2023. Except for a handful, nearly all of them are built for Windows only. The latest Call of Duty is Windows-only. Cyberpunk 2077 is Windows-only. Grand Theft Auto 5, one of the best-selling games of all time, is Windows-only. The list goes on.', 'With almost no chance that major game developers will ever bother bringing their games to Linux natively, Valve, the company behind Steam, has taken matters into its own hands. Driven by the need to make its handheld Steam Deck, which is powered by Linux, a success, Valve has been working on a compatibility layer called Proton. Built on top of work done by others over the years, Proton translates the Windows-specific bits and enables games built for Windows to run on Linux-based systems.', 'Proton is not perfect, and some games still have major issues.

So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.', 'This week in AI, Microsoft unveiled a new standard PC keyboard layout with a ""Copilot"" key. You heard correctly -- going forward, Windows machines will have a dedicated key for launching Microsoft\'s AI-powered assistant Copilot, replacing the right Control key.', ""The move is meant, one imagines, to signal the seriousness of Microsoft's investment in the race for consumer (and enterprise for that matter) AI dominance. It's the first time Microsoft's changed the Windows keyboard layout in about 30 years; laptops and keyboards with the Copilot key are scheduled to ship as soon as late February."", ""But is it all bluster? Do Windows users really want an AI shortcut -- or Microsoft's flavor of AI?"", 'Microsoft\'s certainly made a show of injecting nearly all its products old and new with ""Copilot"" functionality. In flashy keynotes, slick demos and now an AI key, the company\'s making its AI tech prominent -- and betting on this to drive demand.', ""Demand isn't a sure thing. But to be fair, a few vendors have managed to turn viral AI hits into successes. Look at OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, which reportedly topped $1.6 billion in annualized revenue toward the end of 2023. Generative art platform Midjourney is apparently profitable as well -- and hasn't yet taken a dime of outside capital."", 'Emphasis on a few, though. Most vendors, weighed down by the costs of training and running cutting-edge AI models, have had to seek larger and larger tranches of capital to stay afloat. Case in point, Anthropic is said to be raising $750 million in a round that would bring its total raised to more than $8 billion.', ""Microsoft, together with its chip partners AMD and Intel, hopes that AI processing will increasingly move from expensive data centers to local silicon, commoditizing AI in the process -- and it might. Intel's new lineup of consumer chips pack custom-designed cores for running AI. Plus, new data center chips like Microsoft's own could make model training a less expensive endeavor than it is currently."", ""But there's no guarantee. The real test will be seeing whether Windows users and enterprise customers, bombarded with what amounts to Copilot advertising, show an appetite for the tech -- and shell out for it. If they don't, it might not be long before Microsoft has to redesign the Windows keyboard once again."", 'Here are some other AI stories of note from the past few days:', 'Copilot comes to mobile: Microsoft quietly brought Copilot clients to Android and iOS, along with iPadOS.', 'GPT Store: OpenAI announced plans to launch a store for GPTs, custom apps based on its text-generating AI models (e.g., GPT-4), within the next week. The GPT Store was announced last year during OpenAI’s first annual developer conference, DevDay, but delayed in December — almost certainly due to the leadership shakeup that occurred in November just after the initial announcement.', ""OpenAI shrinks reg risk: In other OpenAI news, the startup's looking to shrink its regulatory risk in the EU by funneling much of its overseas business through an Irish entity. Natasha writes that the move will reduce the ability of some privacy watchdogs in the bloc to unilaterally act on concerns."", ""Training robots: Google’s DeepMind robotics team is exploring ways to give robots a better understanding of precisely what it is we humans want out of them, Brian writes. The team's new system can manage a fleet of robots working in tandem and suggest tasks that can be accomplished by the robots' hardware."", 'Intel\'s new company: Intel is spinning out a new platform company, Articul8 AI, with the backing of Boca Raton, Florida–based asset manager and investor DigitalBridge. As an Intel spokesperson explains, Articul8\'s platform ""delivers AI capabilities that keep customer data, training and inference within the enterprise security perimeter"" -- an appealing prospect for customers in highly regulated industries like healthcare and financial services.', 'Dark fishing industry, exposed: Satellite imagery and machine learning offer a new, far more detailed look at the maritime industry, specifically the number and activities of fishing and transport ships at sea. Turns out there are way more of them than publicly available data would suggest -- a fact revealed by new research published in Nature from a team at Global Fishing Watch and multiple collaborating universities.', 'AI-powered search: Perplexity AI, a platform applying AI to web searching, raised $73.6 million in a funding round valuing the company at $520 million. Unlike traditional search engines, Perplexity offers a chatbot-like interface that allows users to ask questions in natural language (e.g., “Do we burn calories while sleeping?” “What’s the least visited country?”).', 'Clinical notes, written automatically: In more funding news, Paris-based startup Nabla raised a cool $24 million. The company, which has a partnership with Permanente Medical Group, a division of U.S. healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente, is working on an ""AI copilot"" for doctors and other clinical staff that automatically takes notes and writes medical reports.', 'You may remember various examples of interesting work over the last year involving making minor changes to images that cause machine learning models to mistake, for instance, a picture of a dog for a picture of a car. They do this by adding ""perturbations,"" minor changes to the pixels of the image, in a pattern that only the model can perceive. Or at least they thought only the model could perceive it.', 'An experiment by Google DeepMind researchers showed that when a picture of flowers was perturbed to appear more catlike to AI, people were more likely to describe that image as more catlike despite its definitely not looking like a cat. Same for other common objects like trucks and chairs.', 'Image Credits: Google DeepMind', ""Why? How? The researchers don't really know, and the participants all felt like they were just choosing randomly (indeed the influence is, while reliable, scarcely above chance). It seems we're just more perceptive than we think — but this also has implications on safety and other measures, since it suggests that subliminal signals could indeed propagate through imagery without anyone noticing."", 'Another interesting experiment involving human perception came out of MIT this week, which used machine learning to help elucidate a particular system of language understanding. Basically some simple sentences, like ""I walked to the beach,"" barely take any brain power to decode, while complex or confusing ones like ""in whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution"" produce more and broader activation, as measured by fMRI.', 'The team compared the activation readings of humans reading a variety of such sentences with how the same sentences activated the equivalent of cortical areas in a large language model. Then they made a second model that learned how the two activation patterns corresponded to one another. This model was able to predict for novel sentences whether they would be taxing on human cognition or not. It may sound a bit arcane, but it is definitely super interesting, trust me.', ""Whether machine learning can imitate human cognition in more complex areas, like interacting with computer interfaces, is still very much an open question. There's lots of research, though, and it's always worth taking a look at. This week we have SeeAct, a system from Ohio State researchers that works by laboriously grounding a LLM's interpretations of possible actions in real-world examples."", 'Image Credits: Ohio State University', 'Basically you can ask a system like GPT-4V to create a reservation on a site, and it will get what its task is and that it needs to click the ""make reservation"" button, but it doesn\'t really know how to do that. By improving how it perceives interfaces with explicit labels and world knowledge, it can do lots better, even if it still only succeeds a fraction of the time. These agent models have a long way to go, but expect a lot of big claims this year anyway! I just heard some today.', ""Next, check out this interesting solution to a problem I had no idea existed but that makes perfect sense. Autonomous ships are a promising area of automation, but when the sea is angry, it is difficult to make sure they stay on track. GPS and gyros don't cut it, and visibility can be poor too — but more importantly, the systems governing them aren't too sophisticated. So they can go wildly off target or waste fuel going on large detours if they don't know any better, a big problem if you're on battery power. I never even thought about that!"", ""Korea's Maritime and Ocean University (another thing I learned about today) proposes a more powerful pathfinding model built on simulating ship movements in a computational fluid dynamics model. They propose that this better understanding of wave action and its effect on hulls and propulsion could seriously improve the efficiency and safety of autonomous marine transport. It might even make sense to use in human-guided vessels whose captains aren't quite sure what the best angle of attack is for a given squall or wave form!"", ""Last, if you want a good recap of last year's big advances in computer science, which in 2023 overlapped massively with ML research, check out Quanta's excellent review."", 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/06/this-week-in-ai-microsofts-sticks-an-ai-ad-on-keyboards/']"

While the licensing portion of the business is struggling, enterprises are increasingly opting for cloud-based Microsoft 365 subscriptions.', 'Besides popular applications such as Office, PowerPoint, and Excel, companies are also using premium offerings in cybersecurity, analytics, voice, and compliance through Microsoft 365 subscriptions. The Office 365 business saw robust expansion and a rise in average revenue per user (ARPU).', ""The company also expects Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI assistant integrated into several of the company's offerings such as Office, Outlook, and GitHub, to attract new paid customers and contribute significant revenue in the coming years."", 'Considering these tailwinds, Microsoft seems to be a compelling pick for 2024.', ""After rallying nearly 120% in 2023, shares of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices have declined by around 6% in 2024. This was based on news of the Dutch government partly revoking ASML Holdings'\xa0export license for shipping some lithography machines to China."", 'It seems that the semiconductor companies fear the possibility of the Chinese government retaliating by restricting the export of certain metals. While this worry cannot be ignored, there are several reasons to like the stock.', ""First, AMD's EPYC server processors have been a major beneficiary of the rising demand for high-performance computing at data centers. With organizations increasingly migrating to the cloud, there has been growing demand for high-performance and cost-effective third-generation and fourth-generation EPYC processors."", ""Subsequently, AMD's server chips have captured over a 50% share in the North American hyperscaler market."", ""Second, AMD's server chips currently have a mid-teens share in the enterprise market. But with partners such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Technologies, and Super Micro Computer expanding their portfolio of AMD products, the company expects more from the enterprise segment in the coming years."", 'Third, AMD expects the data-center AI accelerator market to reach over $400 billion by 2027. To capitalize on this opportunity, the company has launched the MI300 family of chips optimized for AI workloads.', ""The MI300 is competitive with Nvidia's H100 chip in training large language models, but it could prove even better with large language models (running them in a real-time environment) due to its high memory bandwidth. Hence, AMD expects MI300 revenue to surpass $2 billion in fiscal 2024 and is working to ensure a sufficient supply of these chips."", ""Lastly, AMD's investments in developing its software and ecosystem have also helped drive the adoption of its hardware.

Among them was Alphabet\xa0(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which uses AI across a number of products, including its ubiquitous Google search engine.', ""Alphabet's fortunes switched from its stock hitting a 52-week low of $84.86 last January, to a 52-week high of $142.68 by the day after Christmas. So what's in store for 2024?"", ""Well, the new year is already shaping up to be an interesting one for the company. Alphabet faces some potentially major upheavals in 2024, and these factors can affect the decision to invest in Alphabet. So it's prudent to review these events to determine if Alphabet is a stock to buy in the new year."", ""One key factor that could affect Alphabet shares is the company's decision to phase out third-party cookies from its popular Chrome web browser. These cookies are used by advertisers to target you with digital ads based on your activities on the internet, such as the websites you visited."", 'This online tracking raised consumer privacy concerns. So Alphabet decided to move away from third-party cookies, which would eliminate the current targeting mechanism advertisers rely on.', 'It\'s such a big deal, many in the advertising industry call this end to third-party cookies ""Chrome-ageddon"" because Chrome is the world\'s top-ranked web browser, commanding about a 64% market share. Apple\'s Safari browser is in second place, with a 20% share.', 'Alphabet kicks off a months-long process of gradually phasing out third-party cookies in the first quarter of 2024. The company is transitioning Chrome to the Privacy Sandbox, a system Google developed.', ""The Privacy Sandbox limits sharing information about your online activity with third parties. Instead, the data stays on the device you're using, and is accessed by websites or apps you visit to serve you ads targeted to your interests. In this way, Privacy Sandbox tries to balance consumer and advertiser needs."", ""This also means Alphabet will possess oversight of the data collected from Chrome users, giving it a potent incentive for advertisers to continue spending their budgets with the company. A successful transition to Privacy Sandbox is important because advertising accounted for $59.6 billion of Alphabet's $76.7 billion in Q3 revenue."", ""After Privacy Sandbox is in place, it could strengthen Alphabet's economic moat in the digital advertising industry. After all, advertisers would be hard-pressed to skip running ads on the company's globally popular products, such as Google and YouTube."", ""However, Google's search engine supremacy drew the attention of the U.S. Justice Department, which brought an antitrust lawsuit against the company. The suit focuses on Alphabet's payments to companies, such as Apple, to make Google the default search engine on their platforms."", 'The trial is ongoing, with closing arguments scheduled for May. The outcome could range from a fine to Alphabet being forced to restructure its business.', ""Alphabet recently lost a separate antitrust lawsuit related to its Android mobile app store. But these sales accounted for only a portion of Google's other, non-advertising revenue, which brought in $8.3 billion in Q3, far less than the $44 billion Google's search engine advertising delivered."", ""Yet the case against Google's search dominance may not bring grim tidings. Microsoft underwent a similar antitrust lawsuit in 1998 over payments to internet service providers to boost adoption of its Internet Explorer browser. The company reached a settlement. Since then, Microsoft's stock price has increased over the years."", 'So if Alphabet can also achieve a settlement in its antitrust case, its business could remain prosperous in the long run. The company is doing well, as its Q3 revenue of $76.7 billion represents an 11% year-over-year increase.', ""Alphabet's transition from third-party cookies and the antitrust lawsuit against Google may deliver a bumpy ride for its stock price in 2024. Yet over the long term, Alphabet remains a compelling growth investment."", ""Its 11% year-over-year Q3 sales increase is complemented by strong financials. The company's Q3 assets totaled $396.7 billion, with $119.9 billion of that in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Contrast this with total liabilities of $123.5 billion."", ""Moreover, Alphabet benefits from the booming global digital advertising industry, estimated to rise from 2023's $680 billion to $966 billion by 2028. The company also possesses other growth engines, including its cloud computing business, Google Cloud."", ""Now, AI offers Alphabet another avenue of revenue expansion. The AI industry is forecasted to balloon 20-fold by 2030.

With bigger, more established players already having a footprint in most areas where Dutch Bros seeks to expand, the company has to work even harder to build name recognition that can drive sales.', ""With a robust 31% company-operated shop contribution margin and a notable increase in average unit volumes (AUVs) by almost 20% since 2019, Dutch Bros demonstrates that focusing on people doesn't just build a loyal fan base -- it drives impressive financial results."", 'AUV gives you an idea of how much revenue each store is bringing in, on average. A rising AUV indicates that individual stores are becoming more profitable. The increase in AUVs suggests that each of its coffee shops keeps generating significantly more revenue now than a few years ago.', ""As Dutch Bros steams ahead with its ambitious goal of 4,000 total shops, the challenge will be to scale without losing the essence that makes it special. After all, that's still only around 10% of the total Starbucks locations worldwide.

Share prices quickly rose to highs above $60 before falling back to a more recent range near $30.', 'Competition is one of the biggest challenges the company faces, along with a hefty debt incurred as part of its growth processes. Interest on this debt came out to more than $9 million in the most recent quarter, putting a damper on net income and adding a further challenge to reaching its expansion goals.', ""Yes, Starbucks is an unforgettable icon, but in the swirl of coffee choices, Dutch Bros offers a distinct and inviting flavor.

Putting your hard-earned cash in solid corporations with bright futures will help grow your initial capital. And while the healthcare industry may not be the most exciting, top companies that provide healthcare services often stand the test of time. After all, medical care is always in high demand."", ""With that said, let's look at two excellent healthcare stocks worth buying today: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA)."", ""Popular stocks aren't always great investments, but in the case of Eli Lilly, it certainly is. Last year, the biotech made quite a bit of noise thanks to its newly approved anti-obesity drug Zepbound, which looks destined for stardom. Zepbound first hit the market in 2022 in treating type 2 diabetes (it is marketed as Mounjaro in this indication). In addition to these two approvals, it is seeking many other label expansions, from obstructive sleep apnea to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, among others."", ""Zepbound should help drive solid top-line growth for Eli Lilly for years, especially since it isn't the only new medicine the company will rely on. The drugmaker's portfolio has been getting quite the makeover lately, with brand new products such as cancer medicine Jaypirca, ulcerative colitis therapy Omvoh, and two more that should earn the green light relatively soon."", ""The first is lebrikizumab, a potential eczema treatment whose application for approval was declined last year. But since that was entirely due to manufacturing issues, Eli Lilly should be just fine here. The second is the drugmaker's investigational Alzheimer's disease therapy, donanemab, which reported excellent results in a late-stage clinical trial."", ""Eli Lilly's financial results should remain strong, just as they were last year, thanks to its incredible portfolio. In the first nine months of 2023, the company's top line jumped by 17% year over year to $24.8 billion, despite sales of its COVID-19 antibodies completely vanishing compared to the parallel period in 2022."", ""Analysts see Eli Lilly's revenue increasing at a rate of 28.7% per year for the next five years -- an incredible number for a biotech giant. Lastly, Eli Lilly is also a solid dividend stock. All things considered, the company's shares look attractive even after destroying the market in 2023."", ""HCA Healthcare owns and runs a network of medical facilities, mostly hospitals. The company is one of the leaders in this field, with facilities that span most of the country, although it is particularly concentrated in Florida and Texas. HCA Healthcare's business was deeply affected by the pandemic in several ways."", ""First, occupancy rates in its facilities -- one of the critical determinants of the company's revenue -- fluctuated a lot and became somewhat unpredictable. Second, the healthcare giant had to rely on more expensive contract labor in the earlier days of the outbreak."", ""HCA Healthcare is slowly but surely leaving these problems behind, and the company performed pretty well last year, at least as far as its financial results are concerned. Through Sept. 30, 2023, HCA Healthcare's revenue of $47.7 billion increased by a decent 6.5% year over year. Its earnings per share of $13.07 was roughly 9% higher than the year-ago period."", ""HCA Healthcare should continue to rebound progressively. The company's business has excellent prospects. Building a network of well-equipped medical facilities is highly capital-intensive, but it's the first step to success in this business. HCA Healthcare already has the advantage of having formed deep relationships with different players in the healthcare industry, something that will be extremely hard for newcomers to replicate."", ""Unless something drastic happens, the company should remain a leading hospital chain for a long time. Further, even in comparison to its existing competitors, HCA Healthcare has generally been a standout -- for instance, it has continuously increased its market share, going from 23% in 2011 to 27% as of the end of 2020. HCA Healthcare's blueprint for success should continue to work, especially as the world's population ages and there is a higher demand for the services it offers."", ""That's why the company's shares are worth buying today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

Matthew Belloni, an entertainment journalist and founder of the news startup Puck, posted an image to X of his Netflix homepage that encapsulated the current state of streaming. “ALL of the Netflix Top 10 movies right now are licensed from legacy studios, and nine are from studios with their own streaming services (including four recent hits from Warner Bros.),” Belloni wrote. “The Streaming Wars are officially over.”', 'ALL of the Netflix Top 10 movies right now are licensed from legacy studios, and 9 are from studios with their own streaming services (including 4 recent hits from Warner Bros.). The Streaming Wars are officially over. pic.twitter.com/WlnquQ6pt5', '— Matthew Belloni (@MattBelloni) January 4, 2024', 'The fact that Netflix’s competitors have forked over some of their most prized content signals they are done trying to outspend and outmaneuver the industry’s biggest streamer. Instead they now see Netflix as a distributor that has both a vast audience and a willingness to license their content.', 'All this comes as some users sour on streaming, with complaints about rising prices and an increasingly smaller library of new titles to watch. This apparent paradox, of beating the competition while disappointing users, could be attributed to the theory of “platform decay,” which describes the slow decline of online platforms of any kind.', '“Here is how platforms die,” Cory Doctorow, the writer who coined the phrase, wrote in an essay initially published on his website and then reprinted in Wired. “First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.”', 'Doctorow’s less polite term for the platform decay is ""enshittification."" He argues that it\'s baked into the business model of the biggest tech companies.', ""“It is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a 'two-sided market,' where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them,” Doctorow writes."", 'The fact that Netflix seems to have won the streaming wars, one of the most competitive business fights in recent memory, isn’t a surprise. After all, it was a pioneer in direct-to-consumer streaming that wasn’t attached to a cable subscription. It amassed an international audience that dwarfs that of its competitors, which still falter in overseas markets. What does seem counterintuitive is that Netflix is criticized by some for the poor quality of its shows and declining user satisfaction.', 'The famed Hollywood historian Peter Biskind told Fortune he found Netflix “unwatchable.” Five years ago the blogger Matt Stoller wrote that should Netflix win the streaming wars it would hurt the entertainment industry, by emphasizing mediocre content and limiting options. Stoller argued Netflix would use its position as the strongest streamer to undercut filmmakers and “bargain more aggressively against creators,” he told Fortune recently. When this happens it will become harder for a broader assortment of content to be made, which leaves viewers with fewer options to watch. Now, five years later, he says ""it seems like it\'s played out consistent with what I had said.""', 'A report in The Information from 2019, the same year of Stoller’s original blog post, claimed Netflix had a habit of canceling shows after two seasons, regardless of how popular they were, because showrunners tended to ask for raises after their second season. Making less content would seem counterintuitive to a media company hellbent on outmuscling its competition. (A person close to Netflix told The Information it did not have such a policy).', '“The products are not as good as they used to be,” Stoller now says.', 'Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Users do seem to have become generally less enthused with streaming services than they were in recent years. The Wall Street Journal found that around 25% of streaming customers canceled at least three streaming services over the last two years, up from 15% in 2022. Cancellations as a percentage of overall users have also grown, possibly because users are cycling in and out of streamers more frequently than they had in the past. Still, even though more people are canceling subscriptions than previously, most streamers are still growing. For example, Netflix added nine million users in the third quarter of 2023.', 'While Doctorow’s theory of platform decay might describe the user experience, it doesn’t necessarily apply to the company’s business performance. Netflix has 247 million subscribers more than Max, Paramount+, and Peacock combined. Meanwhile, its stock price has soared 53% over the last 12 months.', ""Despite claims of lackluster movies and TV shows, Netflix makes regular appearances during awards season. For this month's Golden Globes, Netflix received 28 nominations. In terms of Oscars, it has well north of a hundred nominations over the years, winning over 20. Its well-known practice of offering few creative notes to filmmakers has helped it attract acclaimed directors like Martin Scorsese, Alfonso Cuaron, and Noah Baumbach, whose movies will, in theory, be in Netflix’s library in perpetuity."", ""Early on, major studios were happy to license their content to Netflix. But once the streaming wars reached their peak, from 2019 to 2020, the studios stopped, preferring instead to keep movies and shows on their own newly launched streaming services. Some of the most prominent examples included binge-watching staples like Friends, which Warner Bros. Discovery took to Max; and The Office, which returned to NBCUniversal's Peacock."", 'In a speech in December, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos called the lack of licensing an ""unnatural state"" for the entertainment industry because studios had long been built on the practice.', ""In recent months, however, a growing number of legacy media companies have accepted Netflix's position as the dominant streamer and licensed it their content in an effort to tap into its huge audience. For example, WBD licensed box office hit Aquaman; NBCUniversal handed over the rights to stream Suits, the legal dramedy starring Meghan Markle; and Disney is working on a deal to stream 14 titles including Lost on Netflix."", ""Many such productions found success they may not have achieved on their parent company’s streamer. Suits, for example, set a record for the most weeks atop Nielsen's streaming ratings—despite the show debuting in 2011."", '""One way or another, we\'re in business with nearly every supplier, including our direct competitors and I think that we bring a ton of value to them,"" Sarandos said on an earnings call in October. ""When you think about what happens when that show runs and becomes a huge success on Netflix, it has lasting value.""', ""WBD CEO David Zaslav says he’s happy to license Aquaman and other DC superhero movies to Netflix if the money is good enough under the belief it helps attract viewers to the franchise's other movies. “In many cases it really helps us,” Zaslav said on a recent earnings call. “People come back and then they want to see the full bouquet of DC movies and the only place to do that is” on Max."", ""Some Wall Street analysts agree with Belloni and his tweet that the fact Netflix’s competitors license content to it is a sign of its impregnable position atop the streaming heap. While other media companies were willing to spend, and lose, vast sums of money in an attempt to compete, they’ve now pulled back on such an approach. Disney, the closest of Netflix's rivals in terms of subscribers, plans to cut $2 billion from its content spending this year."", '“Competition from the other media streaming companies has peaked,” Evercore tech analyst Mark Mahaney told CNBC last month. “It peaked when the CEO of Disney got fired for ‘excess streaming losses.’ All you’ve seen the other streamers do now is cut their spend…and they’re licensing to Netflix. So the competitive dynamics have changed 180 degrees from a year and a half ago.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Phillips 66, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.14 = US$8.5b ÷ (US$78b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Phillips 66 has an ROCE of 14%.

The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 14%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 37%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed."", ""All in all, it's terrific to see that Phillips 66 is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a solid 81% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist."", ""Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Phillips 66   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should know about."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

In the last five years, the Dogs performed worse than the S&P 500 and the Dow on four occasions, including in 2023, as reported by Barron’s. The report also mentioned that over the span of 20 years from the end of 2023, the Dogs\' average annual return was slightly above 8%, including dividends. This trails behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% each year.

For example, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) recently made headlines with a significant decision to reduce its dividend payouts. This decision is notable because it breaks a streak of 48 consecutive years of increasing dividends. The company had been known for its consistent and long-standing commitment to raising dividends, making this move quite unexpected and significant within the financial community.

""It\'s really the future of their company.""', ""The debut mission is a long-awaited milestone after months of various delays in the final stretch of Vulcan's development, and following a testing mishap last year with a Vulcan upper-stage booster. ULA CEO Tory Bruno has said that Vulcan has performed well during recent ground tests."", '""That is an incredibly complicated machine, it\'s tremendously powerful. Everything has to work,"" Bruno said Saturday at Vulcan\'s launch pad. ""It is always inherently risky to fly a rocket. But what we\'re good at is managing that risk.""', ""The mission checklist includes carrying a moon lander that is aiming to make the first U.S. lunar soft landing in half a century. The rocket will be using for the first time engines supplied by Jeff Bezos' space firm Blue Origin."", ""Vulcan's launch also comes as Boeing and Lockheed, which formed ULA in a 2006 merger of their rocket programs, are looking to sell the jointly owned venture, according to three people familiar with the talks."", ""The talks have been a complex, drawn-out process for which Vulcan's launch could have crucial implications, said the sources, who asked not to be identified."", 'ULA declined to comment on any potential deal talks.

That rocket's Russian-imported engines drew criticism from lawmakers that led to its planned retirement."", ""The retirement of Atlas - plus Vulcan's other rocket, Delta - will leave the 200-foot-tall (60-m) Vulcan to handle dozens of lucrative missions and serve as the company's sole challenger to SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9."", ""Vulcan's debut mission will send a privately built lander from space robotics firm Astrobotic to the moon. But the launch itself will also serve as the first of two certification flights required by the U.S. Space Force before Vulcan can fly Pentagon satellites."", ""Space Force is a core customer for Vulcan - the military branch in 2020 picked ULA's Vulcan and its retiring Atlas V to launch 60% of the Pentagon's missions through around 2027."", ""Priced lower than its predecessors at roughly $110 million per launch, Vulcan will seek to reclaim market share from Falcon 9, which is priced at roughly $62 million per launch. SpaceX's cheaper flights have eroded ULA's dominance of government satellite launches in the past decade."", ""Vulcan will also compete with Blue Origin's forthcoming New Glenn rocket, which uses the same engines as Vulcan."", 'ACQUISITION TALKS', 'Acquisition talks for ULA have been underway for more than a year, with dozens of firms, including Blue Origin, having expressed interest, the sources said.', 'Blue Origin did not respond to a request for comment.', ""Boeing's and Lockheed's rationale and timing for selling ULA are unclear. But there have been significant changes to the U.S. space industry since ULA's formation in 2006, when it was created to dominate government launches and clinch some commercial demand from the then-nascent satellite market."", 'Growth of the commercial market was slower than expected, said Richard McKinney, an aerospace consultant and former director of the Air Force\'s space acquisition unit until 2007. ""But it looks like we\'re about there now.""', ""Amazon's planned Kuiper network is set to bring in crucial launch revenue for ULA. That has helped provide Vulcan with a multibillion-dollar backlog of roughly 70 missions split somewhat evenly between government and commercial customers, Bruno has said."", ""Vulcan's development and ULA's shift away from its Atlas and Delta rockets have made estimates of the company's valuation hard to pin down, but analysts speculate it could be $2 billion to $3 billion."", 'Boeing and Lockheed each have their own competing space units. Lockheed, among other pursuits, has ventured into building moon rovers and made strategic investments in ABL Space, a small-launch startup with plans to build larger rockets in the future.', ""Boeing's space program has struggled, primarily with its long-delayed Starliner astronaut capsule that rivals SpaceX's more established Crew Dragon. Troubles with Starliner development have cost Boeing some $1.5 billion since 2014."", 'New ownership could allow ULA to innovate beyond the launch sector in ways its corporate parents were unwilling to allow, former ULA chief scientist Sowers said.', '""The charter of the company was fixed, and it was very limiting,"" he said.

The other three studies are for VX-548 in treating acute pain. I expect good news on all fronts.', ""Vertex knows CF inside and out. It markets the only therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. I predict that the vanzacaftor triple will be the company's biggest CF success so far. The therapy requires only once-daily dosing compared to twice-daily dosing for Vertex's top-selling CF drug Trikafta. Vertex will also have much lower royalty payments for the vanzacaftor triple, assuming it wins regulatory approval."", 'The company reported highly encouraging results in December from a phase 2 study of VX-548 in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. That could bode well for the upcoming late-stage results of the non-opioid drug in treating acute pain.', 'Vertex should have more positive news on the way later in the first quarter. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of March 30 to make an approval decision on Casgevy in treating transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. A thumbs-up seems likely considering that the FDA approved the gene-editing therapy for treating sickle cell disease in December.', 'No stock is guaranteed winner.

I think a big reason for that underperformance is due to setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic and a refusal by the market to accept that Starbucks is entering a new period of transformational growth. Underappreciated and out of favor, Starbucks has the perfect setup for 2024. And I think the stock looks like a steal at the current price of around $94 a share.', 'Starbucks quietly put up a monster fiscal 2023 -- including record revenue and earnings.', 'The coffee kingpin is guiding for 10% to 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 15% to 20% earnings growth thanks to margin expansions. Yet there seems to be little confidence that Starbucks can actually hit these targets given the stock gave up many of its initial post-earnings gains and is hovering within 5% of a 52-week low.', ""Starbucks' growth used to mainly depend on opening more stores. But today, the company's growth plan is far more sophisticated. Digital engagement through the Starbucks app, which works hand in hand with mobile order and pay and the Starbucks Rewards program are driving same-store growth and encouraging more frequent visits and higher sales per transaction both domestically and internationally. In Q4 of fiscal 2023, 90-day active U.S. rewards members reached 33 million and over 21 million in China."", ""What's interesting about this stat is that Starbucks has 16,352 U.S. stores and 6,806 stores in China. So as a ratio of stores to rewards members, China has 3,085 rewards members per store while the U.S. has just 2,018 rewards members per store -- which goes to show that Starbucks' emphasis on its loyalty program and digital offerings could prove more successful in China despite the brand being much more established in the U.S."", ""This trend bodes well in the long term, as Starbucks is investing heavily in China with plans to boost the store count by 13% in fiscal 2024 alone. I'd be curious to see if China can continue growing rewards members at a faster rate than the U.S. in the years to come."", ""Starbucks is leaning big into the pickup concept, focusing on stores with drive-thrus and pickup locations, reducing store footprint, and abandoning the traditional coffee house model in urban areas. It's a strategy that focuses on convenience rather than atmosphere, which bodes well for Starbucks' growth while differentiating it from smaller, often cooler coffee houses."", ""Overall, Starbucks stands out as a stock that has languished for too long. And once the market wakes up to Starbucks' master plan, the stock could soar.

As a separate business, Kyndryl is the world's largest provider of support for business-grade and mission-critical technology systems."", 'Kyndryl got off to a rocky start in life. The stock was worth $6.4 billion on Day One, also known as Nov. 3, 2021. Its stock chart immediately dipped, falling all the way from $28.50 to $8.23 per share in less than a year.', ""But it's not all doom and gloom. Kyndryl's stock has mounted a robust comeback from that brutal initial drop, posting an 87% gain in 2023. The stock still sits 32% below the spin-off date's closing price with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, perhaps leaving room for further gains."", ""So is the IT services stock poised to continue the climb this year? Let's take a closer look."", 'First and foremost, many investors saw Kyndryl as an albatross for IBM -- a low-margin dead weight with limited growth prospects, best shrugged off and forgotten. IBM itself is focusing on high-growth opportunities such as artificial intelligence (AI), data security, and hybrid cloud computing.', 'Big Blue was in the habit of ""normalizing"" its financial reports in the quarters leading up to Kyndryl\'s separation, showing investors how much faster the remaining business would have grown without the IT services anchor. The robust but unexciting IT services business had no place in IBM\'s reformed strategy.', ""Hence, it wasn't surprising to see the new stock losing value in the early days. Moreover, I'm talking about nearly the exact start of the global-inflation panic, which weighed on the entire technology sector in 2022. The timing of Kyndryl's creation was highly unfortunate from this perspective."", ""But wait -- there's more. Kyndryl's top-line sales have declined on a year-over-year basis in each one of its eight earnings reports as a separate company. The company's earnings have almost always been negative, and Kyndryl is burning cash on a regular basis. Kyndryl's downtrend makes perfect sense with these dark clouds looming overhead."", ""The mood around Kyndryl's modest growth prospects has changed. Three of last year's four earnings reports inspired sudden stock jumps the next day even though the actual results didn't always impress. For example, the first-quarter update in August 2023 fell short of the analyst consensus targets across the board, according to Benzinga's data. Yet, the stock price rose by 18.6% the next day."", ""You see, Kyndryl's investors have accepted the current challenges and started looking forward to better days ahead."", 'Management keeps raising their full-year estimates in every quarterly report. As a result, your average analyst has lowered their full-year net-loss expectations by 16% over the last three months and 30% in six months.', ""In November's earnings call, CEO Martin Schroeter highlighted how alliances with so-called hyperscaler cloud-computing platforms are reshaping Kyndryl's long-term strategy:"", '""Selective migration of certain workloads to the cloud is a prime example of where large organizations are looking to modernize, innovate and drive efficiency,"" Schroeter said. The CEO added:', 'Our hyperscaler-related signings are up more than 35% so far this year, and our hyperscaler-related revenues were up even more. And some of our largest new logo signings have been for customers who want to leverage our hyperscale alliances and cloud migration expertise.', ""Since IBM is a hyperscaler with a broad range of cloud-computing services, sector leaders such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) might have been less interested in partnering with a rival's IT services."", ""Kyndryl appears to have found a promising niche in the ever-changing IT industry. Adjusted earnings should turn positive in fiscal year 2025, according to management's long-term guidance. Meanwhile, the stock is an absolute bargain at 0.3 times trailing sales."", ""This is certainly a different spin on the opportunity of today's AI-inspired technology investments. You're not getting direct access to IBM's high-growth ambitions, but buying Kyndryl shares at today's bargain-bin price could result in strong returns over time. There's nothing wrong with slow and predictable growth as long as the general trend points upward -- and Kyndryl is starting to match that description nowadays."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kyndryl right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kyndryl, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kyndryl wasn't one of them.

The long hood 'Vette was what every red-blooded American, male or female, dreamed of owning. Legendary author Joan Didion, for example, loved the Corvette, and owned multiple examples throughout her life."", ""Part and parcel to that story was the powerful V8 that gave the Corvette its heart — and robust, loud tailpipe roar. Don't even think about suggesting that Chevy put a damper on the volume coming from that 8-cylinder."", 'That said, Corvette is dipping its toes into the future with the electrified E-Ray. Yahoo Finance was invited to Bowling Green, Ky., where the Corvette was assembled, to get an exclusive look at the first ever E-Ray rolling off the assembly line.', ""The E-Ray is the first Corvette with all-wheel drive, with its front wheels powered by an electric motor. The hybrid setup features this electric motor paired with the V8 mounted in the rear of the vehicle, giving this car over 650 horsepower — making it the quickest 'Vette yet, capable of a zero to 60 time of 2.5 seconds."", ""The E-Ray's all-wheel-drive system means this is a Corvette for all seasons, including winter. Corvette engineers tested the car in the mountains of Colorado, with the E-Ray powering through even snowy conditions."", ""The 1.9 kilowatt hour battery utilized by the E-Ray is small, but it does have the ability to discharge a lot of energy and recharge itself fairly quickly — more so than normal hybrids. The battery is also capable of giving the car around three to four miles of range, which is good for shuttling the E-Ray around town on very short trips. The E-Ray isn't meant for long-distance electric driving — it's a car meant for performance, with the motor filling the gaps in low-torque situations, improving handling at the limit, and, as mentioned above, giving the car the ability to be driven year-round."", 'GM\'s general assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., builds only one car: the Corvette. GM\'s halo sports car has been produced here since 1981, starting with the fourth generation Corvette (known as the ""C4""), through the current-gen Corvette, the C8.', ""And it's here where the first-ever E-Ray is rolling off the production line."", 'Thousands of people work together, with the help of robots and a mechanical roof-mounted rack, bringing parts and partially assembled structures together.

We\'ve always done it. All of our tooling in the plant set up so that way all your drive-line components, everything assembled to perfection in the rear,"" said Andrew Keltner, GM\'s general assembly future produce lead (essentially the man in charge), who during our interview was standing behind the first ever E-Ray off the line.

""We\'ve had to actually shift our manufacturing process to now cover both the front and rear, right? You got drive line in the front with the electric motor separately from the drive line in the rear with that V8 engine,"" he said. ""So really a challenge for us setting that up.""', 'Part of that challenge means introducing a few spots in the line where E-Rays — which roll on the same line as other, non-electrified \'Vettes — get their electric motor installed on the front axle. A battery is then added in the middle tunnel of the car that separates the driver and passenger in the cockpit. Keltner said the ""dream"" of the C8 always included the E-Ray, so the internal chassis made for the C8 was designed with electrification in mind.', '""The package space that the product engineers provided, it was there,"" Keltner said, alluding to the tunnel that was used to bisect the cabin and make space for the battery. ""Just like with the product engineering being available ... we created holes in the assembly line for our tools to load that 300-volt battery up into the car.

The Corvette snaps your head back when launching off the line — with no time to catch your breath.', ""The 1.9 kilowatt hour battery that sits between the driver and passenger in the center tunnel is a high-output, high-discharge, high-recharge type of battery that's able to give a lot of power to that electric motor — and then recharge itself very quickly through the braking of the front wheels."", 'That GM and Chevy can offer this car at a starting price of $105,000 (approximately $115K as tested), is a quite a feat of engineering and supply chain expertise.', 'What the future (and competition) hold for Corvette', ""But the Corvette E-Ray isn't the only hybrid super sports car on the road. The McLaren Artura is one, as well as the world-beating . But while the Artura and 296 are great, the two cars cost twice as much as the E-Ray. The only competitor that comes somewhat close is the Acura NSX hybrid, but Acura discontinued the NSX last year."", ""Cars like the upcoming Porsche 911 hybrid and Mercedes SL 63 E Performance promise more competition.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pinnacle West Capital is:', '7.6% = US$495m ÷ US$6.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Pinnacle West Capital has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Electric Utilities industry average (8.3%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Pinnacle West Capital."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', ""Pinnacle West Capital clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.36. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Visa insiders own about US$244m worth of shares (which is 0.05% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.', ""An insider sold Visa shares recently, but they didn't buy any.

So let's consider which stocks might dethrone Nvidia and truly shine in 2024."", 'Jake Lerch (CrowdStrike Holdings): My choice for king of 2024 is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). The company, which provides AI-powered cybersecurity services to its clients, is riding high after a memorable 2023. ', 'Indeed, few stocks performed better than CrowdStrike in 2023. Shares rallied 137% thanks to skyrocketing cybersecurity demand and improving financial fundamentals.', ""Let's start with the overall demand for cybersecurity. Hacking and digital blackmail cases are on the rise. In fact, the last few months of 2023 saw an explosion of notable cyberattacks that brought prominent organizations to their knees."", ""In September, hackers targeted hospitality and gaming giant MGM in a cyberattack that caused massive disruptions to the company's operations. Several pieces of key infrastructure -- including slot machines, hotel key cards, and ATMs -- malfunctioned or were rendered inoperable as a result of the hack."", 'Meanwhile, in October, genetics testing firm 23andMe disclosed a data breach that affected at least 14,000 customers.

Revenue in its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Oct. 31, 2023) grew 35% year-over-year to a trailing twelve-month total of $2.9 billion. Free cash flow jumped to $3.59/share, up from $2.89/share one year earlier."", ""That said, CrowdStrike isn't for every investor, in part because of its sky-high valuation.

That has taken its forward P/E ratio to 55, making this an expensive stock by just about any measure.', 'Nonetheless, the productivity gains offered by AIP bode well for the stock. Even with a high valuation, Palantir holds tremendous potential to outperform the Nvidias of the world.', 'Justin Pope (Monday.com): Enterprise software is a ruthlessly competitive space where companies often sacrifice profits for revenue growth.

Over 2,000 enterprise accounts spend over $50,000 on the product annually. The product works for small organizations too, so there is room for long-term growth as Monday.com's customers grow and spend more over time."", 'But ultimately, investors want to see profits -- and Monday.com has those too.', ""After the company's cash flow roughly broke even for several quarters, free cash flow exploded to the positive in 2023. Its $179 in trailing 12-month cash flow is already 26% of its sales, a giant leap in profitability in a short time. That bodes well for bottom-line earnings (net income). Monday.com turned GAAP positive in Q3, so buckle up for rapid earnings growth in 2024 and beyond."", ""Consensus analyst estimates call for earnings per share (EPS) of $2.57 in 2024, valuing the stock at a forward P/E of 67. For a business that could compound earnings at a rapid pace for several years, that's a very reasonable price to pay. Remember, the stock still sits over 60% off its high over two years ago despite being much bigger and more profitable than back then.

Management in mid-October forecast an 11% sales increase to $8.6 billion. Look for this figure to be lifted by a rising global membership base and steadily increasing average spending.', ""Wall Street is excited about the new advertising business that should grow into a significant revenue stream over time. That offering has quickly made Netflix's pricing more competitive with rivals as well. It also helps that competitors like Walt Disney\xa0have also been hiking their membership fees.

A notable acquisition includes that of global intermodal shipping company Triton International for $1.2 billion.', ""What this essentially means is that Brookfield Infrastructure is stepping into 2024 with a strong cash-flow profile and should be able to meet its annual dividend growth goal of 5% to 9%. Put another way, you can expect a dividend raise of at least 5% from Brookfield Infrastructure stock this year while you enjoy a high dividend yield of 4.5% or more whether you buy units of the partnership or corporate shares. It's a lucrative deal, and with the Federal Reserve also expected to cut interest rates this year, I'd pick Brookfield Infrastructure as a top stock to buy now."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Like many stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is coming off a great performance in 2023. Shares of the big biotech soared nearly 41%. I think that Vertex is in store for another strong year in 2024 -- and probably a solid performance in January.', 'The company is starting the new year off with more than one bang. Vertex expects to announce results in early 2024 from six late-stage clinical studies. Three of them focus on its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo targeting cystic fibrosis (CF). The other three studies are for VX-548 in treating acute pain. I expect good news on all fronts.', ""Vertex knows CF inside and out. It markets the only therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. I predict that the vanzacaftor triple will be the company's biggest CF success so far. The therapy requires only once-daily dosing compared to twice-daily dosing for Vertex's top-selling CF drug Trikafta. Vertex will also have much lower royalty payments for the vanzacaftor triple, assuming it wins regulatory approval."", 'The company reported highly encouraging results in December from a phase 2 study of VX-548 in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. That could bode well for the upcoming late-stage results of the non-opioid drug in treating acute pain.', 'Vertex should have more positive news on the way later in the first quarter. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of March 30 to make an approval decision on Casgevy in treating transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. A thumbs-up seems likely considering that the FDA approved the gene-editing therapy for treating sickle cell disease in December.', 'No stock is guaranteed winner. However, I think that few stocks are in a better position than Vertex to deliver market-beating gains in 2024 and over the next several years.', 'Daniel Foelber (Starbucks): Over the last three years, Starbucks stock is down over 9% compared to a 26.7% gain in the S&P 500. I think a big reason for that underperformance is due to setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic and a refusal by the market to accept that Starbucks is entering a new period of transformational growth. Underappreciated and out of favor, Starbucks has the perfect setup for 2024. And I think the stock looks like a steal at the current price of around $94 a share.', 'Starbucks quietly put up a monster fiscal 2023 -- including record revenue and earnings.', 'The coffee kingpin is guiding for 10% to 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 15% to 20% earnings growth thanks to margin expansions. Yet there seems to be little confidence that Starbucks can actually hit these targets given the stock gave up many of its initial post-earnings gains and is hovering within 5% of a 52-week low.', ""Starbucks' growth used to mainly depend on opening more stores. But today, the company's growth plan is far more sophisticated. Digital engagement through the Starbucks app, which works hand in hand with mobile order and pay and the Starbucks Rewards program are driving same-store growth and encouraging more frequent visits and higher sales per transaction both domestically and internationally. In Q4 of fiscal 2023, 90-day active U.S. rewards members reached 33 million and over 21 million in China."", ""What's interesting about this stat is that Starbucks has 16,352 U.S. stores and 6,806 stores in China. So as a ratio of stores to rewards members, China has 3,085 rewards members per store while the U.S. has just 2,018 rewards members per store -- which goes to show that Starbucks' emphasis on its loyalty program and digital offerings could prove more successful in China despite the brand being much more established in the U.S."", ""This trend bodes well in the long term, as Starbucks is investing heavily in China with plans to boost the store count by 13% in fiscal 2024 alone. I'd be curious to see if China can continue growing rewards members at a faster rate than the U.S. in the years to come."", ""Starbucks is leaning big into the pickup concept, focusing on stores with drive-thrus and pickup locations, reducing store footprint, and abandoning the traditional coffee house model in urban areas. It's a strategy that focuses on convenience rather than atmosphere, which bodes well for Starbucks' growth while differentiating it from smaller, often cooler coffee houses."", ""Overall, Starbucks stands out as a stock that has languished for too long. And once the market wakes up to Starbucks' master plan, the stock could soar. In the meantime, investors can collect a 2.5% dividend yield from simply holding the stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

After the Nasdaq Composite shed 33% of its value in 2022 -- one of the worst market performances in over a decade -- the index has nearly returned to its former glory, closing the door on 2023 with a gain of 43%.', 'History offers a hint about what could be ahead in the coming year. Since it first began trading in 1972, in every year that followed a bear-market rebound, the tech-heavy index has continued to rally, gaining 19% on average. While there are no guarantees in investing, this suggests the current recovery has more room to run.', 'One strategy investors use to find winning stocks is to look at companies that have conducted stock splits in recent years, as those moves are historically preceded by years of robust gains. One such company is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Over the past decade, the stock has generated total returns of 12,780%, resulting in a 4-for-1 stock split in mid-2021.', 'The chipmaker logged gains of 239% last year, which has some investors concerned about its valuation. However, a little digging will unearth evidence that the stock is cheaper than it might by some measures appear.', 'Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have been a boon for Nvidia. More specifically, generative AI went viral last year, and these algorithms have been applied to a wide variety of mundane, time-consuming tasks, resulting in greater productivity. Increased efficiency generally results in greater profits, and businesses have been scrambling to integrate AI models into their operations to benefit from the expected windfalls.', 'So why does this matter to Nvidia? In short, the company produces the gold standard of graphics processing units (GPUs), which can not only provide the computing power necessary to render lifelike images in video games but can also supply the computational horsepower necessary to support AI systems. This is all possible because of parallel processing, which takes computationally intensive jobs and breaks them down into smaller, more manageable chunks, allowing GPUs to conduct a multitude of complex mathematical calculations simultaneously.', 'As a result, Nvidia processors have been deployed in a wide range of applications, including cloud computing and data centers, which will act as hubs for many AI systems.', ""The accelerating adoption of AI will play to Nvidia's strengths, and while estimates vary greatly, there is general agreement that the opportunity is staggering. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the generative AI market will grow from $40 billion in 2022 to $1.3 trillion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%."", ""A quick look at Nvidia's recent results helps illustrate the potential wrought by AI. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's revenue grew 206% year over year to $18.1 billion -- a company record -- while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 1,274% to $3.71. Those percentages were partially skewed by easy comps resulting from 2022's tech sector slowdown, but help illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity."", ""Investors shouldn't expect the company's triple- and quadruple-digit gains to continue over the long term, but its ongoing growth should be robust nonetheless. For its fiscal fourth quarter, now underway, management is forecasting more record results, including revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be an increase of 230% year over year. This shows that the AI opportunity is far from over."", ""There's more good news. Nvidia is the undisputed market leader for chips used for machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- controlling an estimated 95% of the market, according to New Street Research."", 'As the default provider of processing solutions for AI, Nvidia is well positioned to ride this secular tailwind higher.', 'While the prospects of AI are intriguing, Nvidia has several other growth drivers up its sleeve. For example, the recent slump in the gaming market is beginning to turn. The global graphics card market for gaming is expected to grow from $3.65 billion in 2024 to $15.7 billion by 2029, a CAGR of 34%, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence. As the leading provider of gaming GPUs, this secular tailwind will boost Nvidia as well.', 'Nvidia is also the leading provider of processors used to zip data through the ether and around data centers, with an estimated 95% of that market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. The digital transformation shows no signs of slowing as companies shift even more workloads and business systems to the cloud, so the data center boom will likely continue. The data center market is expected to grow from $263 billion in 2022 to $603 billion by 2030, a CAGR of roughly 11%, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research.', ""This all shows that Nvidia's chips are so much more than just the gold standard for AI -- its products are also the semiconductors of choice for the gaming, cloud computing, and data center markets."", ""After Nvidia shares notched gains of more than 200% in 2023, investors are naturally uneasy about its valuation -- but there's a catch."", ""The stock is currently selling for 27 times sales and 65 times earnings -- lofty metrics that would seem to validate investor concerns. However, those measurements don't factor in Nvidia's triple-digit percentage growth rate. For a company expanding this rapidly, the more appropriate metric to use is the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which for Nvidia is less than 1 -- the standard for an underpriced stock. For the S&P 500, the PEG ratio is more than 2, which further puts Nvidia's valuation into the proper context."", 'Given its dominant position in numerous growth markets, its strong history of growth, and its reasonable valuation, Nvidia is one stock-split stock investors should buy ahead of an expected Nasdaq surge in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

And Meta Platforms takes third place with a 12-month median price target of $385 per share, implying 12% upside.', ""Here's what investors should know about Nvidia."", 'Nvidia is an accelerated computing company that provides hardware, software, and services across four end markets: gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Its invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999 brought revolutionary visual effects to video games and films, and the company still holds a 90% market share in workstation graphics processors.', 'However, Nvidia redefined itself in 2006 when it introduced CUDA, a programming model that allows its GPUs to function as general purpose processors. That innovation helped the company find purchase in data centers, where its GPUs have become the gold standard in accelerating complex workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI).', 'In fact, Forrester Research has said Nvidia GPUs are synonymous with AI infrastructure, and the company has consistently achieved leading results at the MLPerf benchmarks, which evaluate the training and inference performance of AI hardware, software, and services. That superiority has allowed Nvidia to capture an 80% to 95% market share in machine learning (ML) processors, according to analysts. The company also holds a 95% market share in data center accelerators, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.', 'Nvidia has solidified its position as the gold standard in AI chips by branching into subscription software and cloud services. It recently launched DGX Cloud, which provides on-demand access to supercomputing infrastructure, software, and pretrained ML models that support the development and deployment of AI applications, including generative AI applications. The service also offers frameworks that address specific use cases across different industries, from manufacturing and logistics to retail and cybersecurity.', 'DGX Cloud is a particularly momentous development because it unifies and democratizes access to Nvidia AI technologies. To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, ""Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud.""', 'Nvidia looked exceptionally strong in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29). Revenue skyrocketed 206% to $18.1 billion on record sales in the data center segment, and non-GAAP net income increased 588% to $10.0 billion as high-margin software and services accounted for more of total revenue.', 'The company also reported solid sales growth in gaming and professional visualization, as detailed below:', 'Data center sales soared 279% to $14.5 billion.', 'Gaming sales increased 81% to $2.9 billion.', 'Professional visualization sales jumped 108% to $416 million.', 'Automotive sales ticked up 4% to $261 million.', 'Nvidia currently values its addressable market at $1 trillion, but that figure should explode as more businesses turn to AI in search of productivity gains. Indeed, a report from Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending alone will compound by 42% annually to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032.', 'Nvidia is well-positioned to grow its business as AI weaves its way into the fabric of daily life. In fact, the Wall Street consensus calls for the company to increase earnings per share 42% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 63 times earnings easier to stomach. Indeed, given its incredible growth, that multiple looks cheap compared to competing chipmakers and cloud infrastructure providers.', ""Specifically, Nvidia's PEG ratio -- the price-to-earnings multiple divided by expected annual earnings growth -- currently sits at 1.5. That is a big discount to semiconductor stocks AMD and Intel, which sport PEG ratios of 35.6 and 3.6, respectively. It's also a discount to cloud providers Amazon and Microsoft, which have PEG ratios of 2.8 and 2.5, respectively."", 'As a caveat, 63 times earnings is not cheap, per se. But price-to-earnings multiples must be considered in context. Nvidia is forecast to grow earnings much faster than its peers, so the stock warrants a higher valuation. That said, Nvidia is still a risky investment because the stock could fall sharply if the company fails to meet expectations.', 'Patient investors should still consider buying a small position today. Shareholders may or may not see the 37% return in 2024 that analysts expect, but Nvidia has become the heart of the current AI boom.

Investors who regularly contribute new deposits into their investment accounts are likely on the lookout for quality companies they can count on to deliver in 2024 and beyond.', ""Sometimes, the best opportunities are hiding in plain sight. And other times, the stocks that were out of favor can reach a valuation that is too cheap to ignore. Here's why Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) stand out as five top stocks to buy this month."", ""Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Netflix): Netflix investors had a good 2023, but the next year could be even better for shareholders. That's because the streaming video giant is on track to return to double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter, likely marking a third consecutive quarter of accelerating sales gains."", 'Netflix will announce its Q4 results on Jan. 23, and most Wall Street pros expect good news in that report. Management in mid-October forecast an 11% sales increase to $8.6 billion. Look for this figure to be lifted by a rising global membership base and steadily increasing average spending.', ""Wall Street is excited about the new advertising business that should grow into a significant revenue stream over time. That offering has quickly made Netflix's pricing more competitive with rivals as well. It also helps that competitors like Walt Disney\xa0have also been hiking their membership fees. With streaming companies focused on profitability in 2024, Netflix has a clear edge as the industry's biggest player."", ""I'll be watching financial metrics like cash flow and operating profit margin in late January. Both metrics are trending higher and executives hiked their short-term forecasts following Netflix's strong third-quarter report. Shareholders stand to see improving returns if operating profit margin continues marching toward 20% of sales even as the company generates ample cash flow heading into 2024."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the water cooler talk of choice among investors for more than a year now. Many AI experts have seen their share prices soar as investors seek the best investment ideas in this red-hot sector.', 'But somehow, IBM has missed the train so far.', ""Big Blue's stock has only gained 14% over the last year. That return trails AI darlings Nvidia's\xa0triple and C3.ai's double by a long shot, of course. But IBM also lagged behind broad market indexes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite\xa0rose by 50% and the more generic S&P 500\xa0tracker added 23% over the same period."", ""IBM's stock carries a price tag with a deep-discount valuation of 21 times earnings, 12 times free cash flows, and 2.4 times sales. Meanwhile, the likes of Nvidia and C3.ai soared to nosebleed-inducing valuations. For example, here's how these three AI experts compared in terms of price-to-sales ratios over the last year. IBM is the flat blue line at the bottom:"", 'Why am I so offended by IBM\'s low valuation and modest price gains in the AI era? Well, this company started doubling down on what it calls ""strategic imperatives"" more than a decade ago, shedding slow and unprofitable operations in order to focus on a handful of key markets.', 'AI was always one of these target sectors.', ""And IBM has been researching and commercializing AI technologies for many decades. Remember when the first chess computer beat the human world champion? That was IBM's Deep Blue system, making history against Garry Kasparov in 1997. This company has been making consumer-facing history in AI for a long, long time."", 'Yes, the AI sector is teeming with prospective winners. However, very few of them come with bargain-bin stock prices and generous dividend policies. IBM comes with both of these advantages, alongside an unmatched history of AI excellence.', ""I can't wait to see IBM's Watson.AI platform for business-oriented AI services making a name for itself as the AI mania evolves. And if you buy shares at this modest price level, that savvy investment should serve you well in the long run."", ""Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Infrastructure): Brookfield Infrastructure owns and operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets across utilities, transportation like rail and toll roads, midstream energy, and data infrastructure. There's one common link between all -- they're the kind of assets that are essential to an economy and are, therefore, fairly insulated from economic downturns. Also, that means the bulk of these assets -- almost 90% -- generate income for Brookfield Infrastructure under long-term or regulated contracts. That alone offers a lot of stability to the company."", ""It makes sense to expect shares of a company with such a rock-solid business profile to rise steadily over time. 2024 could be one such year for Brookfield Infrastructure stock, especially after its dud performance in 2023 when fears of rising interest rates weighing on the company's growth plans gripped the markets."", 'Brookfield Infrastructure, however, has displayed great resilience so far, having grown its funds from operations (FFO) per unit by 8.5% year over year during the nine months that ended Sept. 30, 2023, driven by higher tariffs and investments of more than $1 billion. A notable acquisition includes that of global intermodal shipping company Triton International for $1.2 billion.', ""What this essentially means is that Brookfield Infrastructure is stepping into 2024 with a strong cash-flow profile and should be able to meet its annual dividend growth goal of 5% to 9%. Put another way, you can expect a dividend raise of at least 5% from Brookfield Infrastructure stock this year while you enjoy a high dividend yield of 4.5% or more whether you buy units of the partnership or corporate shares. It's a lucrative deal, and with the Federal Reserve also expected to cut interest rates this year, I'd pick Brookfield Infrastructure as a top stock to buy now."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Like many stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is coming off a great performance in 2023. Shares of the big biotech soared nearly 41%. I think that Vertex is in store for another strong year in 2024 -- and probably a solid performance in January.', 'The company is starting the new year off with more than one bang. Vertex expects to announce results in early 2024 from six late-stage clinical studies. Three of them focus on its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo targeting cystic fibrosis (CF). The other three studies are for VX-548 in treating acute pain. I expect good news on all fronts.', ""Vertex knows CF inside and out. It markets the only therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. I predict that the vanzacaftor triple will be the company's biggest CF success so far. The therapy requires only once-daily dosing compared to twice-daily dosing for Vertex's top-selling CF drug Trikafta. Vertex will also have much lower royalty payments for the vanzacaftor triple, assuming it wins regulatory approval."", 'The company reported highly encouraging results in December from a phase 2 study of VX-548 in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. That could bode well for the upcoming late-stage results of the non-opioid drug in treating acute pain.', 'Vertex should have more positive news on the way later in the first quarter. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of March 30 to make an approval decision on Casgevy in treating transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. A thumbs-up seems likely considering that the FDA approved the gene-editing therapy for treating sickle cell disease in December.', 'No stock is guaranteed winner. However, I think that few stocks are in a better position than Vertex to deliver market-beating gains in 2024 and over the next several years.', 'Daniel Foelber (Starbucks): Over the last three years, Starbucks stock is down over 9% compared to a 26.7% gain in the S&P 500. I think a big reason for that underperformance is due to setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic and a refusal by the market to accept that Starbucks is entering a new period of transformational growth. Underappreciated and out of favor, Starbucks has the perfect setup for 2024. And I think the stock looks like a steal at the current price of around $94 a share.', 'Starbucks quietly put up a monster fiscal 2023 -- including record revenue and earnings.', 'The coffee kingpin is guiding for 10% to 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 15% to 20% earnings growth thanks to margin expansions. Yet there seems to be little confidence that Starbucks can actually hit these targets given the stock gave up many of its initial post-earnings gains and is hovering within 5% of a 52-week low.', ""Starbucks' growth used to mainly depend on opening more stores. But today, the company's growth plan is far more sophisticated. Digital engagement through the Starbucks app, which works hand in hand with mobile order and pay and the Starbucks Rewards program are driving same-store growth and encouraging more frequent visits and higher sales per transaction both domestically and internationally. In Q4 of fiscal 2023, 90-day active U.S. rewards members reached 33 million and over 21 million in China."", ""What's interesting about this stat is that Starbucks has 16,352 U.S. stores and 6,806 stores in China. So as a ratio of stores to rewards members, China has 3,085 rewards members per store while the U.S. has just 2,018 rewards members per store -- which goes to show that Starbucks' emphasis on its loyalty program and digital offerings could prove more successful in China despite the brand being much more established in the U.S."", ""This trend bodes well in the long term, as Starbucks is investing heavily in China with plans to boost the store count by 13% in fiscal 2024 alone. I'd be curious to see if China can continue growing rewards members at a faster rate than the U.S. in the years to come."", ""Starbucks is leaning big into the pickup concept, focusing on stores with drive-thrus and pickup locations, reducing store footprint, and abandoning the traditional coffee house model in urban areas. It's a strategy that focuses on convenience rather than atmosphere, which bodes well for Starbucks' growth while differentiating it from smaller, often cooler coffee houses."", ""Overall, Starbucks stands out as a stock that has languished for too long. And once the market wakes up to Starbucks' master plan, the stock could soar. In the meantime, investors can collect a 2.5% dividend yield from simply holding the stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Oracle had US$88.8b in debt in November 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$8.69b, its net debt is less, at about US$80.1b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Oracle had liabilities of US$24.4b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$105.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$8.69b in cash and US$6.80b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$114.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', 'While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Oracle has a huge market capitalization of US$282.4b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Oracle's debt is 3.9 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 4.7 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Oracle grew its EBIT by 2.3% in the last year. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Oracle's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Oracle recorded free cash flow worth 57% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""Oracle's net debt to EBITDA was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered cast it in a significantly better light. For example, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is relatively strong. We think that Oracle's debt does make it a bit risky, after considering the aforementioned data points together. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Oracle   you should know about."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Mexico has been the top U.S. trading partner since the beginning of the year, reporting $656 billion in two-way trade from January through November, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.', 'Even with almost 70% of the trade between Mexico and the U.S. taking place through trucking, the market for cross-border cargo insurance can be confusing for many, according to Mark Vickers, executive vice president and head of international logistics at Reliance Partners.', 'Vickers said large carriers dedicate a significant amount of their capacity to shipper-specific cross-border contracts.', '“They win these contracts due to a number of factors, but paramount is their linehaul rate, cross-border risk management strategy and insurance, and volume of asset allocation,” Vickers said.', '', 'Cross-border shippers often prefer to work with a carrier that can provide them 100 trucks a week as opposed to smaller carriers, according to Vickers.', '“These large carriers are then able to get preferential terms on their Mexican cargo insurance because of the volume they are moving, and because of the static nature of their risk management,” Vickers said. “This makes it difficult for a small to medium-sized broker or carrier to compete against the big dogs. Cargo insurance rates in Mexico will be much better for a large carrier that has standardization in their risk management than for a broker that is attempting to move a single spot shipment or for a carrier that is moving a lower volume. However, we are seeing brokerages and smaller carriers get awarded business when they are proactively offering Mexican cargo insurance and are spotlighting their risk management protocols if their rates are in line.”', 'Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Reliance Partners is a trucking insurance provider with nine locations nationwide. Vickers joined Reliance Partners in 2021 after the company acquired Borderless Coverage, which he founded in 2018.', 'He started Borderless Coverage because many large shippers were asking for an all-risk cargo insurance solution in Mexico.', '“I was at Total Quality Logistics for almost eight years before I started Borderless Coverage, and during my time there I was handling a lot of expedited inbound and outbound shipments from Laredo, Texas,” Vickers said. “All of these shippers in this industry, they’re using me for brokerage services domestically and then they started to say, ‘Hey, you’re doing a great job handling all of our expedited shipments. Can you also start handling our Mexican business?’”', 'Liability insurance is not required in Mexico. However, when the shipper does not declare the value of the merchandise, the liability is limited to $90.52. Given the extremely low limit, pursuit of liability actions is uncommon in Mexico, Vickers said.', '“What I needed as a freight broker and what my shippers were asking for 10 to 12 years ago was a product they could layer on top of their global policy and/or self-insurance program (that typically carries a deductible of $100,000), which covers theft and has a deductible of $5,000 or less,” Vickers said. “Borderless Coverage does just that and forces shippers, brokers and carriers to work together better in a siloed cross-border supply chain.”', 'With more global manufacturers moving parts or all of their supply chains to Mexico, Vickers said small and medium-size brokers and carriers need to understand all the insurance options they have for loads moving through the country.', '“Cargo insurance in Mexico is now much more accessible, more cost-effective, and now being requested by over 30% of U.S. based cross-border shippers,” he said. “It’s more cost-effective because logistics firms are using it at over 500% more than it was being used prior to the pandemic, prior to the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (trade pact) and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, which accounts for much of the reasons behind the supply chain congestion that has resulted in nearshoring to Mexico.”', 'As more cross-border freight moves between the two countries, cargo theft continues to be an issue in Mexico. Reliance Partners has launched its Mexico Cargo Hijacking Data Portal, where shippers, carriers and brokers can see some of the latest trends across Mexico.', 'There were 6,030 incidents of cargo theft across Mexico between January and September 2023, an 8% year-over-year increase from the same period in 2022, according to Reliance Partners.', 'In November, Mexico’s National Association of Vehicle Tracking and Protection Companies recorded 306 cargo theft cases across the country, averaging more than 10 a day.', 'In August, the Mexican Alliance of Carrier Organizations threatened to go on strike if federal and state authorities did not implement more protective measures across roadways, which they agreed to before the work stoppage took place.', 'Vickers said federal and state authorities in Mexico still need to do more.', '“The government needs to get more involved; that’s why there was almost a very large strike in Mexico from drivers because of the violent hijackings, and the government wasn’t doing anything at all to help that,” he said. “They need to take a more aggressive stance on cargo theft.”', 'Ryder System Inc. has leased a 234,475-square-foot industrial space in Haltom City, Texas.', 'The space is in the recently constructed Northmark Commerce Center, a Class A\xa0 facility that includes 32-foot clearance heights, single- and multi-tenant functionalities, cross-dock configurations, 56 dock doors, 132 parking spaces, 19 off-dock trailer stalls, and a secured drop lot with 104 additional trailer stalls.', 'Miami-based Ryder (NYSE: R) is a leasing, fleet management, transportation and supply chain solutions provider.', 'Haltom City is between Dallas and Fort Worth and in close proximity to AllianceTexas, a 27,000-acre, master-planned industrial, mixed-use and residential development.', 'The Northmark Commerce Center was also recently sold to an institutional buyer, according to the Newmark Group, which handled the sale.

The answer is yes and no, depending on your tolerance for near-term risk. Here's what you need to know before buying the stock."", ""Don't buy UPS if you can't stomach the potential for near-term risk. Package delivery companies are cyclical, meaning their delivery volumes and earnings depend on economic activity. In addition, customers often shift to lower-cost delivery options in periods of lower economic growth."", ""As shown below, UPS's lower-cost ground service volumes and revenue declined significantly less than the higher-cost deferred and next-day air services. That led to revenue in the U.S. domestic package segment to decline by 6.3% in the first nine months compared to the same period last year."", 'UPS U.S. Domestic Package Margin', 'Revenue Per Piece', 'Change in Average Daily Package Volume (first nine months 2023)', 'Revenue (first nine months)', 'Revenue Change (first nine months)', 'Next Day Air', '$22.31', '(11.9)%', '$7,240 million', '(8.6)%', 'Deferred', '$16.59', '(22.2)%', '$3,491 million', '(15.3)%', 'Ground', '$11.21', '(7.4)%', '$32,312 million', '(4.7)%', 'Total', '$12.59', '(8.9)%', '$43,043 million', '(6.3)%', 'Data source: UPS presentations. Change figures are year over year to the comparable period of 2022.', ""Unfortunately, there's a risk that these negative trends could extend into 2024 because UPS chief rival FedEx disappointed investors with its second-quarter 2024 earnings and outlook for the rest of its financial year. The weakening trading environment led FedEx to lower its 2024 sales guidance to a low-single-digit decline from the previous guidance of flat sales in 2023."", ""Moreover, given that UPS's fourth quarter -- unlike FedEx, UPS' financial year correlates with the calendar year -- tends to be its highest revenue generator (it includes Thanksgiving and Christmas), UPS could miss its full-year 2023 expectations, let alone give lackluster outlook for 2024. Finally, these difficult near-term trends are reflected in Wall Street analyst estimates, which imply that UPS revenue won't grow on a year-over-year basis until the second quarter of next year."", ""Don't buy UPS stock if you can't tolerate the potential for some near-term bad news or don't like holding a stock reporting negative growth."", ""A glass-half-full viewpoint sees things differently. There's nothing wrong with UPS's end markets that won't be sorted out with lower interest rates taking the brakes off the economy. As noted, UPS is a cyclical company, and it often makes sense to buy such stocks when they are going through a trough period and have negative sentiment directed toward them."", ""In addition, UPS's volume and revenue were hit by protracted labor negotiations in 2023. In a nutshell, customers diverted volumes from UPS's network in fear of disruptions caused by potential strikes. While the diverted volumes hurt UPS in 2023, the company can grow in 2024 by winning back customers -- and management believes it's already doing so."", ""However, the strongest argument for buying UPS stock as a dividend play is related to the sustainability of its dividend and the company's ability to grow its earnings and cash flow over the long term.\xa0With 2023 likely a trough year for UPS, the market expects $6.1 billion in free cash flow, more than enough to cover the current dividend payout of $5.3 billion to investors."", ""As for UPS's long-term growth prospects, despite a challenging year, the company is well on track to hit its growth targets in areas like healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Meanwhile, management continues to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies like automation and smart facilities that help lower its cost per piece. Indeed, there's a strong case for UPS being a more robust business in a year as it comes out of a slow economic period."", ""In summary, UPS undoubtedly faces some near-term headwinds, and cautious investors may want to hear management's guidance for 2024 before buying the stock. On the other hand, it's tough to time entry points into a stock. If you are comfortable with the long-term outlook and look forward to a 4% dividend yield, UPS is an ideal way to get some income and invest in a recovery play for 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and United Parcel Service wasn't one of them.

Investors who regularly contribute new deposits into their investment accounts are likely on the lookout for quality companies they can count on to deliver in 2024 and beyond.', ""Sometimes, the best opportunities are hiding in plain sight. And other times, the stocks that were out of favor can reach a valuation that is too cheap to ignore. Here's why Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) stand out as five top stocks to buy this month."", ""Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Netflix): Netflix investors had a good 2023, but the next year could be even better for shareholders. That's because the streaming video giant is on track to return to double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter, likely marking a third consecutive quarter of accelerating sales gains."", 'Netflix will announce its Q4 results on Jan. 23, and most Wall Street pros expect good news in that report. Management in mid-October forecast an 11% sales increase to $8.6 billion. Look for this figure to be lifted by a rising global membership base and steadily increasing average spending.', ""Wall Street is excited about the new advertising business that should grow into a significant revenue stream over time. That offering has quickly made Netflix's pricing more competitive with rivals as well. It also helps that competitors like Walt Disney\xa0have also been hiking their membership fees. With streaming companies focused on profitability in 2024, Netflix has a clear edge as the industry's biggest player."", ""I'll be watching financial metrics like cash flow and operating profit margin in late January. Both metrics are trending higher and executives hiked their short-term forecasts following Netflix's strong third-quarter report. Shareholders stand to see improving returns if operating profit margin continues marching toward 20% of sales even as the company generates ample cash flow heading into 2024."", 'Anders Bylund (IBM): Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the water cooler talk of choice among investors for more than a year now. Many AI experts have seen their share prices soar as investors seek the best investment ideas in this red-hot sector.', 'But somehow, IBM has missed the train so far.', ""Big Blue's stock has only gained 14% over the last year. That return trails AI darlings Nvidia's\xa0triple and C3.ai's double by a long shot, of course. But IBM also lagged behind broad market indexes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite\xa0rose by 50% and the more generic S&P 500\xa0tracker added 23% over the same period."", ""IBM's stock carries a price tag with a deep-discount valuation of 21 times earnings, 12 times free cash flows, and 2.4 times sales. Meanwhile, the likes of Nvidia and C3.ai soared to nosebleed-inducing valuations. For example, here's how these three AI experts compared in terms of price-to-sales ratios over the last year. IBM is the flat blue line at the bottom:"", 'Why am I so offended by IBM\'s low valuation and modest price gains in the AI era? Well, this company started doubling down on what it calls ""strategic imperatives"" more than a decade ago, shedding slow and unprofitable operations in order to focus on a handful of key markets.', 'AI was always one of these target sectors.', ""And IBM has been researching and commercializing AI technologies for many decades. Remember when the first chess computer beat the human world champion? That was IBM's Deep Blue system, making history against Garry Kasparov in 1997. This company has been making consumer-facing history in AI for a long, long time."", 'Yes, the AI sector is teeming with prospective winners. However, very few of them come with bargain-bin stock prices and generous dividend policies. IBM comes with both of these advantages, alongside an unmatched history of AI excellence.', ""I can't wait to see IBM's Watson.AI platform for business-oriented AI services making a name for itself as the AI mania evolves. And if you buy shares at this modest price level, that savvy investment should serve you well in the long run."", ""Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Infrastructure): Brookfield Infrastructure owns and operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets across utilities, transportation like rail and toll roads, midstream energy, and data infrastructure. There's one common link between all -- they're the kind of assets that are essential to an economy and are, therefore, fairly insulated from economic downturns. Also, that means the bulk of these assets -- almost 90% -- generate income for Brookfield Infrastructure under long-term or regulated contracts. That alone offers a lot of stability to the company."", ""It makes sense to expect shares of a company with such a rock-solid business profile to rise steadily over time. 2024 could be one such year for Brookfield Infrastructure stock, especially after its dud performance in 2023 when fears of rising interest rates weighing on the company's growth plans gripped the markets."", 'Brookfield Infrastructure, however, has displayed great resilience so far, having grown its funds from operations (FFO) per unit by 8.5% year over year during the nine months that ended Sept. 30, 2023, driven by higher tariffs and investments of more than $1 billion. A notable acquisition includes that of global intermodal shipping company Triton International for $1.2 billion.', ""What this essentially means is that Brookfield Infrastructure is stepping into 2024 with a strong cash-flow profile and should be able to meet its annual dividend growth goal of 5% to 9%. Put another way, you can expect a dividend raise of at least 5% from Brookfield Infrastructure stock this year while you enjoy a high dividend yield of 4.5% or more whether you buy units of the partnership or corporate shares. It's a lucrative deal, and with the Federal Reserve also expected to cut interest rates this year, I'd pick Brookfield Infrastructure as a top stock to buy now."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Like many stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is coming off a great performance in 2023. Shares of the big biotech soared nearly 41%. I think that Vertex is in store for another strong year in 2024 -- and probably a solid performance in January.', 'The company is starting the new year off with more than one bang. Vertex expects to announce results in early 2024 from six late-stage clinical studies. Three of them focus on its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo targeting cystic fibrosis (CF). The other three studies are for VX-548 in treating acute pain. I expect good news on all fronts.', ""Vertex knows CF inside and out. It markets the only therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. I predict that the vanzacaftor triple will be the company's biggest CF success so far. The therapy requires only once-daily dosing compared to twice-daily dosing for Vertex's top-selling CF drug Trikafta. Vertex will also have much lower royalty payments for the vanzacaftor triple, assuming it wins regulatory approval."", 'The company reported highly encouraging results in December from a phase 2 study of VX-548 in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. That could bode well for the upcoming late-stage results of the non-opioid drug in treating acute pain.', 'Vertex should have more positive news on the way later in the first quarter. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of March 30 to make an approval decision on Casgevy in treating transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. A thumbs-up seems likely considering that the FDA approved the gene-editing therapy for treating sickle cell disease in December.', 'No stock is guaranteed winner. However, I think that few stocks are in a better position than Vertex to deliver market-beating gains in 2024 and over the next several years.', 'Daniel Foelber (Starbucks): Over the last three years, Starbucks stock is down over 9% compared to a 26.7% gain in the S&P 500. I think a big reason for that underperformance is due to setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic and a refusal by the market to accept that Starbucks is entering a new period of transformational growth. Underappreciated and out of favor, Starbucks has the perfect setup for 2024. And I think the stock looks like a steal at the current price of around $94 a share.', 'Starbucks quietly put up a monster fiscal 2023 -- including record revenue and earnings.', 'The coffee kingpin is guiding for 10% to 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 15% to 20% earnings growth thanks to margin expansions. Yet there seems to be little confidence that Starbucks can actually hit these targets given the stock gave up many of its initial post-earnings gains and is hovering within 5% of a 52-week low.', ""Starbucks' growth used to mainly depend on opening more stores. But today, the company's growth plan is far more sophisticated. Digital engagement through the Starbucks app, which works hand in hand with mobile order and pay and the Starbucks Rewards program are driving same-store growth and encouraging more frequent visits and higher sales per transaction both domestically and internationally. In Q4 of fiscal 2023, 90-day active U.S. rewards members reached 33 million and over 21 million in China."", ""What's interesting about this stat is that Starbucks has 16,352 U.S. stores and 6,806 stores in China. So as a ratio of stores to rewards members, China has 3,085 rewards members per store while the U.S. has just 2,018 rewards members per store -- which goes to show that Starbucks' emphasis on its loyalty program and digital offerings could prove more successful in China despite the brand being much more established in the U.S."", ""This trend bodes well in the long term, as Starbucks is investing heavily in China with plans to boost the store count by 13% in fiscal 2024 alone. I'd be curious to see if China can continue growing rewards members at a faster rate than the U.S. in the years to come."", ""Starbucks is leaning big into the pickup concept, focusing on stores with drive-thrus and pickup locations, reducing store footprint, and abandoning the traditional coffee house model in urban areas. It's a strategy that focuses on convenience rather than atmosphere, which bodes well for Starbucks' growth while differentiating it from smaller, often cooler coffee houses."", ""Overall, Starbucks stands out as a stock that has languished for too long. And once the market wakes up to Starbucks' master plan, the stock could soar. In the meantime, investors can collect a 2.5% dividend yield from simply holding the stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

Existing shareholders are happy, but those still on the sidelines may wonder whether it's still worth investing in this drugmaker. The good news is that those late to the party can rest assured that Vertex Pharmaceuticals remains an excellent buy. Let's consider why the biotech is a solid long-term bet."", ""If there is just one thing to know about Vertex, it is that it holds an actual monopoly in its core therapeutic area: cystic fibrosis (CF). This rare and devastating genetic disorder causes damage to the lungs and leads to a shortened life expectancy. Vertex's medicines target the underlying genetic causes of the illness, and since it is such a severe disease, these drugs aren't a luxury for patients -- they are a necessity. Vertex's dominance in this field grants it pricing power. And while others have tried to challenge it, no one has succeeded."", ""Vertex's work in CF is the reason it has crushed the market over the past decade, and it is still going strong. In the first nine months of 2023, the company's revenue of $7.3 billion jumped by 11% year over year. Here's some more good news for Vertex: Of the 88,000 CF patients in its core markets, more than 20,000 remain untreated but are eligible for its current therapies."", ""There are 5,000 more who aren't eligible for any of its approved products, but the biotech is working on developing new ones. Considering Vertex has been in this market for over 10 years, the remaining opportunities are exciting. The biotech should rely on its CF medicines to help drive solid financial results through at least the next five years."", ""It can be dangerous for a company to be a one-trick pony, no matter how good the trick is. That's why Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been looking to diversify its portfolio despite its success in CF. The company recently achieved that goal with the approval of Casgevy, a gene editing treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia (TDT), a pair of rare blood diseases. Casgevy is approved in the U.S. for SCD, and in the U.K. for SCD and TDT."", 'More approvals should come down relatively soon. Vertex Pharmaceuticals developed the medicine in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy will cost $2.2 million in the U.S., which is not at all unreasonable for a gene-editing medicine. Case in point: Bluebird Bio also earned approval for a competing SCD medicine, which it decided to price at $3.1 million.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals does have an advantage here thanks to its being more cash-rich than Bluebird, not to mention the former's well-established ability to negotiate with third-party payers, many of whom it already has relationships with. Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics are going after an initial patient population of 32,000 people."", ""Pending label expansions, that could rise to well over 100,000 patients. At a price tag of $2.1 million, it's not hard to see the potential here."", 'There are more promising programs in the pipeline for Vertex. At the end of last year, it posted positive phase 2 results for its VX-548 therapy in treating neuropathic pain. The medicine is also undergoing a phase 3 trial for acute pain, and top-line data is expected early this year. The biotech is planning to release data from a late-stage study for a next-gen CF therapy relatively soon.', ""Vertex's pipeline also features ambitious programs, including in trying to develop a functional cure for type 1 diabetes. Vertex Pharmaceuticals and its shareholders have already reaped the rewards for the company's excellent innovative capabilities, but by the looks of it there is plenty left in the tank.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$10.5b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$13.0b', 'US$13.7b', 'US$14.9b', 'US$15.7b', 'US$16.4b', 'US$17.0b', 'US$17.5b', 'US$18.1b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 5.40%', 'Est @ 4.45%', 'Est @ 3.78%', 'Est @ 3.31%', 'Est @ 2.98%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$9.9k', 'US$10.7k', 'US$10.9k', 'US$10.7k', 'US$11.0k', 'US$10.9k', 'US$10.7k', 'US$10.5k', 'US$10.2k', 'US$9.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$105b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

There's certainly no shortage of choices out there. Thousands of stocks pay them to varying degrees."", ""If you need good, reliable dividend growth from a quality company, however, that's a slightly different story. Only a few dividend-paying names could be considered a rock-solid option for almost everyone's portfolio. Dow Jones Industrial Average component Coca-Cola\xa0(NYSE: KO) is arguably your top choice among these prospects. It doesn't just boast an impressive dividend track record -- it's dividend royalty. And there's no reason to think that's going to change at any point in the foreseeable future."", ""You've certainly heard of the organization. Coca-Cola is of course the world's most popular soft drink. And yet, that particular brand is only a small sampling of the company's product lineup. Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Powerade sports drinks, and Dasani water are just some of the other beverages in the Coca-Cola family. It's got something to sell to nearly everyone's taste."", ""This is no minor detail either. The world continues to cut back on its consumption of sugary sodas. It's increasingly drinking the aforementioned water, tea, and juice. Customers purchase these drinks regardless of the economic backdrop, too, making the company's top and bottom lines relatively predictable from one quarter to the next."", ""Except, the company's business may be even more predictable -- and better suited for driving dividend growth -- than you might realize."", ""Contrary to a common assumption, Coca-Cola doesn't actually do a great deal of its own bottling these days. It's spent several of the past few years selling most of its bottling operations to localized owners, here and abroad. The bulk of the company's income comes through the sale of branded concentrate to these bottlers. These bottlers are of course are expected to manufacture a quality product, but they also benefit from Coca-Cola's proven marketing prowess."", ""And this matters. See, this particular business model offloads the bulk of any inflation risk onto the bottlers themselves, who cover the costs for things like delivery, facilities, and the manpower needed to run these physical, labor-intensive operations. That's why Coca-Cola's net profits actually went up even though revenue went down following 2017's completion of the sale of its bottling operation."", ""Perhaps more important, there's more than enough profit to cover the dividend payments being made ... now, and in the future."", ""Yet that's still not the top reason that income-minded investors would want to own a stake in this iconic company."", ""To say Coca-Cola is brilliant at marketing is an understatement. Its advertising program is genius. A combination of lifestyle branding and sales-prompting ads has arguably made it the premier name in the beverage business. Indeed, it's not a stretch to suggest Coca-Cola and several of its other brand names are cultural touchstones. (Branding consultancy Interbrand names Coca-Cola the eighth-best worldwide brand of 2023.) Such iconic brands are of course easier to promote."", ""There are added benefits to size and scale, though. Those are the wider sharing of operating costs, and sales leverage. It's easier for salespeople to make distribution deals with retailers when they're working with a wide portfolio of products, and when that retailer knows The Coca-Cola Company's brands will always be in demand. See, consumers tend to buy their favorite drinks regardless of the economic environment."", ""Evidence of this claim lies in the fact that the company's top line was consistently growing before 2015 -- when it began selling its bottling operations -- and after 2017 following the completion of those sales."", 'This persistent growth benefits shareholders in one clear way. That is, ever-rising revenue translates into ever-rising profits, which in turn supports ever-rising dividend payments. To this end, not only has Coca-Cola paid dividends for decades now, but it has also raised its annual dividend payout in each of the past 61 years. Only a handful of companies can top or match that claim.', ""These aren't chump-change increases either. The current quarterly payout of $0.46 per share is well up from the payout of $0.28 per share 10 years back, and is nearly triple the quarterly per-share dividend payment of $0.17 being dished out 30 years ago."", 'This dividend growth, importantly, has outpaced inflation seen within the United States during this stretch.', ""And that's key. While you can certainly find higher-yielding dividend stocks than the one Coke shares boast right now, without reliable dividend increases, these other stocks lose more and more of their luster as time marches on."", ""It also doesn't hurt that with or without its dividend the company is a quality brand with proven staying power."", ""It's obviously not the only dividend-growth option out there. Dozens of companies have upped their annual payouts for decades now. Plenty of blue chip stocks are growing their dividends faster than inflation is chipping away at their value. Other corporations have been in business for a long time and will remain in business for the indefinite future."", 'Very few companies offer such a strong combination of all three attributes as Coca-Cola does though.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Waste Management (NYSE:WM) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Waste Management."", ""While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 42% more capital into its operations. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", 'To sum it up, Waste Management has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return.

The council also identifies poisoning, motor vehicles and falls as the first three leading causes in this category. The age group with the highest degree of preventable deaths falls in the range of 21-67 with poisoning as the main cause for all ages. However, what is even more concerning is 62 million people (1 in every 5) looking for nonfatal preventable injury medical consultation in 2021. Nonfatal injuries that result in emergency department visit show higher statistics for fall-related injuries followed by struck by or against and motor vehicle accidents. The number of visits to the emergency department for unintentional injuries was 25.5 million in 2021.', 'Road injuries and fatalities are becoming an increasing menace for the world. According to the latest World Health Organization’s report, road traffic fatalities are about 1.19 million people per year, with 20-50 million sustaining injuries including disabilities. With a three-fold greater chance than high income countries, the low-income countries are a greater victim of road traffic crashes. However, as one of the countries with a heavy traffic load on roads (284 million vehicles on road) and a high count of valid driving license holders, the US has been reported as the top country for most car accidents in 2019.', 'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, motor vehicle accidents have been either the first or second cause of death in major industry groups. The population motor vehicle death rate has decreased drastically in the last century and has been reported at 14.3 per 100,000 population. Nevertheless, this does not mean that there is nothing to worry about anymore since the vehicle death rate in 2021 still went up by 8.5%.\xa0 Motor vehicle accidents leading to medical attention were recorded at 5.4 million in 2021.\xa0 Total motor vehicle injury costs were reported as $498.3 billion. Motor vehicle fatalities have been recorded the highest between the age group of 15-64 years old. Forbes Advisor puts down collision as the major cause of motor vehicle accidents which can be attributed mostly to drunk driving and speeding. \xa0Children under 15 experience the greatest number of deaths due to car accidents. On a slightly happy note however, it is expected that the number of road accident per one million people in the US would be falling down by 2025, along with a decrease for fatalities- albeit, a smaller one.', 'In 2020, the US recorded a 97% increase in personal injury/product liability cases. A 70% for law firms has also been registered in 2021, with a 3.3% rise in litigation practice as well. It is therefore, not surprising that the law firm industry revenue is growing. The combined revenue for top 100 firms have shown a continuous increase over the years from 2015-2020, with an even greater rise recorded for 2020-2022 period. Collectively, these firms have generated a $131 billion revenue in 2022.', 'Associated with a higher motor vehicle accident rate is the higher demand for vehicle insurance as well. Currently a $147 billion industry, cost of car insurance is on the rise as post-pandemic inflation and surge back to roads have driven up accidents and cost of bills. The forecast for the motor insurance industry for the year 2024 is at $1.36 trillion.', 'With the niche for insurance companies created due to an increasing car accident trend, many businesses in the sector have erupted over the years. Among them Progressive Corp. (NYSE:PGR), Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Allstate (NYSE: ALL) are few of the most famous. Of the three, Progressive Corp. (NYSE: PGR) make up 14% of the market share and Allstate (NYSE: ALL) 10.8%. Forbes Advisor has picked Travelers (NYSE:TRV) as great for drivers with a speeding ticket.', 'Progressive Corp. (NYSE: PGR) is one of the largest motor insurance companies is the US. They provide both personal and commercial auto insurance. Allstate (NYSE: ALL) is yet another one of the best insurance companies in the US that provide auto as well as other forms of insurances for individuals.', ""However, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) has been telling some state insurance departments that it'll no longer provide commercial coverage like auto and liability.

So far, states that have received withdrawal notices from Allstate (NYSE:ALL) include Arizona, Idaho, Virginia, Montana, North Carolina and 10 others. This has resulted in 25K policies which won't be renewed."", 'According to USA Today, while fatal car crashes have indeed been on the rise in different states of the country and stand at 43,000 crashes a year, the crashes resulting in death are less than 1%. Texas, Florida and California have been highlighted as most likely to experience fatal car accidents, mainly due to high population and tourism.
