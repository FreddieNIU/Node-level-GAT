This week is the first big one of this reporting cycle. The season will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five large-cap companies are set to beat Q4 2022 earnings results next week. These are Nucor Corp. NUE, American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, SAP SE SAP and Rockwell Automation Inc. ROK.Q4 2022 Earnings Results So FarAs of Jan 20, 55 S&amp;P 500 companies reported their earnings results. Total earnings of these companies are down 10.8% year over year on 7.4% higher revenues with 67.3% beating EPS estimates and 67.3% beating revenue estimates. Our current projection shows that for fourth-quarter 2022, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index as a whole are expected to decline 7.4% year over year on 4% higher revenues.Our Top PicksFive large-cap companies are set to beat earnings estimates this week.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The chart below shows the price performance of five above-mentioned stocks in the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor is committed to expanding its production capabilities and growing its business through strategic acquisitions. NUE has already commissioned some of its growth projects. These should drive growth and strengthen Nucor’s position as a low-cost producer.Story continuesNUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market. NUE remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive Nucor’s margins.Zacks Rank #2 Nucor has an Earnings ESP of +3.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.5% over the last 30 days. NUE recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.9%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.American Airlines Group has benefitted from improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front. Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13% higher than the level recorded in fourth-quarter 2019.AAL’s debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025. AAL’s codeshare agreement with Indian low-cost airline, IndiGo, is an added positive.Zacks Rank #2 American Airlines Group has an Earnings ESP of +9.79%.

The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.International Business Machines is likely to witness growth driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. Synergies from the Red Hat buyout are boosting the competitive position of IBM in the hybrid cloud market.International Business Machines is likely to benefit from the robust adoption and broad-based availability of IBM Blockchain World Wire — a blockchain-driven global payments network aimed at accelerating and optimizing cross-border payments. IBM is also poised to gain from the spin-off of the legacy infrastructure services business as it focuses on the hybrid cloud strategy.Zacks Rank #3 International Business Machines has an Earnings ESP of +1.90%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.3% for the current year. IBM recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 1.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 25, after the closing bell.SAP’s performance is gaining from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Synergies from recent acquisitions bode well. Frequent product launches like SAP Build augur well.Momentum in SAP’s Business Process Intelligence platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions along with healthy traction witnessed in SuccessFactors Employee Central, Ariba and Fieldglass, Qualtrics and other cloud-based offerings is noteworthy.Zacks Rank #2 SAP has an Earnings ESP of +3.09%.

Meanwhile, analysts are getting bullish with 1 estimate raised for 2022 and 2023 within the last week.Story continuesThe 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen to $0.23 from $0.11 in the last 90 days. That's moving in the right direction but it's still down 86.6% from 2022, where the company earned $1.72.Online dating apps, and all apps, in general, saw surging use during the pandemic which has started to wind down as the economy slows and consumers tighten spending.But one estimate is also higher in the last week for 2023. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $0.19 in 2023, which is still down 18% from 2022, but it appears that the analysts were a little too pessimistic.Shares Rally in the Last MonthBumble shares fell 18.9% in the last year, and are well off their 2021 IPO highs.Yet the shares have staged a nice rally in the last month, adding 15.7%.You aren't getting the shares on sale on a P/E basis, however, as they trade with a forward P/E of 126.4.The Street might have been too pessimistic about Bumble in 2022. If you're looking for an online dating app company where the analysts are raising earnings estimates, then Bumble might be one for the short list.Bear of the Day:Stanley Black &amp; Decker is in the midst of a business transformation while it also has to fight inflationary pressures and the challenging macroeconomic environment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings fall for the second year in a row in 2023.Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the world's largest tool company with nearly 50 manufacturing facilities in the United States and more than 100 worldwide.It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners and other industrial equipment. It's iconic brands include DEWALT, BLACK+DECKER, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY, CUB CADET, HUSTLER AND TROY-BILT.Earnings Estimates for 2022 and 2023 Continue to FallStanley Black &amp; Decker will report fourth quarter and full year results on Feb 2, 2023. What will it guide for 2023?Last quarter, on Oct 27, 2022, it lowered its full year guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.65 from $5.00 to $6.00. As you might assume, analysts lowered their estimates accordingly.But they have continued to cut.1 estimate has been cut for 2022 in the last 30 days. 2022 earnings are now expected to fall 57.6% from last year to $4.44, down from $10.48.Analysts are also still bearish on 2023. 2 estimates have been lowered over the last 30 days. Earnings are expected to fall another 5.8% to $4.18. That's down from $6.71 just 3 months ago.It's because of these earnings estimates cuts that the stock has fallen to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The cuts are bearish.Shares Plunge Below the COVID LowsShares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker have fallen 51% over the last year but even more devastating to long-term investors, the shares are now down 48% over the last 5 years as well.Yes, the shares have gotten a bid to start 2023, rising 20.7% over the last month but they aren't cheap, with a forward P/E of 20.5.The good news is that it is still shareholder friendly, paying both a dividend, which it raised for the 55th consecutive year again last year, and doing a share buy back. The dividend is yielding 3.7%.But there is a lot of uncertainty heading into this earnings report. Investors might want to wait on the sidelines to see what the outlook is for 2023.Additional content:3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Before Earnings This WeekMany stocks in the Basic Materials sector outperformed the broader market over the last year and provided a much-needed hedge against inflation.Let's take a look at three highly ranked Basic Material stocks set to report earnings this week that investors may want to consider buying in 2023 as well.Freeport McMoRanStarting the list is mineral exploration and development miner Freeport McMoRan.Freeport is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on January 25, with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Freeport McMoRan conducts its operations primarily through its principal subsidiaries' PT Freeport Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Corporation, and Atlantic Copper. It is important to note that PT Freeport Indonesia's principal asset Papua, is an Indonesia-based mine that contains the world's largest copper and gold reserves.With copper prices hitting their highest levels in the last six months on the London Metal Exchange, Freeport McMoRan stock is sticking out with earnings estimate revisions trending higher for fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22 with its Q4 report.Q4 Preview:The rise in copper prices, primarily attributed to the reopening of China, which is the world's largest copper consumer, is great timing as Freeport McMoRan earnings are expected to have dipped year over year during Q4 after a tough prior-year quarter to follow.Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to dip -58% to $0.40 a share compared to $0.96 a share in Q4 2021. On the top line, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, a -13% decrease from the prior year quarter. Still, an earnings beat on the company's bottom line is not completely out of the picture.Earnings ESP:The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction is a useful tool in indicating which stocks could top quarterly earnings estimates by comparing the Zacks Consensus to the Most Accurate Consensus.With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport McMoRan's Q4 earnings at $0.40 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.42 per share, FCX is expected to beat expectations by 6.96%.Takeaway:Certainly, a strong earnings beat on Freeport McMoRan's bottom line could lead to more upside in the stock. This could be supported by the company potentially offering better-than-expected guidance in correlation with higher copper prices.Nucor Corporation Steel Producer and metal recycler Nucor is another stock investors may want to consider buying ahead of its Q4 earnings on January 26. Nucor stock sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions notably rising for fiscal 2023.Even better, Nucor stock has been one of the top performers out of the basic materials sector over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and is already up 15% to start 2023.Q4 Preview:Following an excellent prior-year quarter, earnings are forecasted at $4.18 per share for Nucor's fourth quarter compared to $7.97 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected at $7.91 billion which would be a -23% YoY decline.However, with iron and steel prices remaining higher despite cooling off recently, it is quite possible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for a fifth consecutive quarter.Earnings ESP: Nucor stock has an ESP of 3.29% as the Zacks Consensus for Q4 earnings is $4.18 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.32 per share indicating the company could beat on its bottom line.Takeaway:Despite the year-over-year quarterly drop in earnings, Nucor stock trades at just 11.8X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 41.4X and a 23% discount to the median of 15.3X.Nucor's valuation appears to already support the likelihood that the company's earnings could decrease as steel prices move lower which still makes the stock attractive at its current levels with earnings estimates going up.Steel DynamicsRounding out the list is Steel Dynamics, which is set to report its Q4 earnings on January 25. Also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Steel Dynamics FY23 earnings estimates have gone up 36% over the last 60 days to $10.82 per share compared to estimates of $7.94 a share two months ago.Steel Dynamics is also a leading steel producer and recycler of metal in the United States and one of the most diversified steel companies in the U.S. with a vast range of specialty products.The performance of Steel Dynamics stock has been incredible over the last year, up +106%, standing out among stocks across any sector.Q4 Preview:Like Nucor, Steel Dynamics follows a stellar prior year fourth quarter. Steel Dynamics Q4 earnings are anticipated at $3.60 per share compared to $5.98 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected to be $4.73 billion and down -11% YoY.Still, it is quite plausible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for what would be a 13th consecutive quarter dating back to January of 2020.Earnings ESP:The Zacks ESP for Steel Dynamics indicates the company could once again beat on its bottom line. With the Zacks Consensus for Nucor's Q4 earnings at $3.60 a share, the most accurate estimate of $3.77 per share indicates the possibility of a 4.82% earnings beat.Takeaway:The top and bottom line growth for Steel Dynamics has been massive over the last few years as steel prices soared, and it is noteworthy that the company has also beaten sales expectations for 12 consecutive quarters.Steel Dynamics also trades attractively relative to its past at just 9.9X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 24.2X and the median of 12.2X.With its valuation also supporting the potential drop in steel prices, Steel Dynamics stock could have more upside especially if the company continues its stellar track record of topping quarterly expectations.Bottom Line After the very impressive top and bottom line growth these basic material stocks had in recent years, investors will definitely want to pay attention to their Q4 earnings. The rising earnings estimate revisions make the possibility of beating Q4 expectations quite plausible for Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, and Steel Dynamic stock and could continue supporting their strong performances.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

13,7fff9946-a4ff-3daa-bc75-37e8c0350095,UNM,2023-01-25,Unum (UNM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-reports-next-week-150003550.html,1674572403,STORY,['UNM'],"[Unum (UNM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +64%.Revenues are expected to be $3 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Unum?For Unum, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Unum would post earnings of $1.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of +7.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Unum doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy. Last year’s economic condition has investors turn their attention toward income-generating stocks. Over the years, dividend companies with resilient business models have helped investors to weather inflationary periods smoothly. Considering the risks of recession and investors’ appetite for dividend stocks, companies are trying to maintain or raise their payouts. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set a record payment in the fourth quarter of 2022, growing by 10.2% from the same period last year. The report also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividend payments have grown for 13 consecutive years.According to analysts, dividend stocks are a good investment option for investors as dividend companies can often grow their payouts faster than inflation. This complies with Guinness Atkinson Funds' report that sheds light on the dividend strategies relative to inflation. The report highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 dividend growth surpassed the rate of inflation by over three times from December 1940 to April 2015.In the past 12 months, dividend stocks have outperformed the broader market. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by only 0.79% in the period, compared with an 8.9% drop in the wider market, as of January 24.Over the years, dividends have contributed significantly to the market’s overall returns. On average, dividends represented 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were below 10% since 1929, as reported by Lord Abbett. Dividend companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have not only raised their payouts for decades but also boast strong balance sheets, which makes them solid investment options.Story continues12 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Nick Chong on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we identified the dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index. After that, we sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data, which means that these stocks are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies. Our list reflects the 12 best S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks according to hedge funds. However, it should be kept in mind that hedge funds usually invest in dividend stocks not for their dividend yields but for their upside capital gains potential.12 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy12. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products related to medical, commercial, and industrial markets. In December, Deutsche Bank initiated its coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a $310 price target. The firm recommended the stock for its defensive posturing.In its recently announced Q4 2022 earnings, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) posted revenue of $8.37 billion, which showed a 2.8% growth from the same period last year. For FY22, the company's operating cash flow of $8.5 billion, and its free cash flow came in at $7.4 billion. Due to its strong balance sheet and solid dividend policy, the company is among the best S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks to buy.On December 6, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past eight years. In addition to dividend stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), investors are also paying attention to DHR for stable income.At the end of Q3 2022, 89 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), growing from 82 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is nearly $5 billion. Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company in Q3.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a Georgia-based home improvement company that sells tools and construction-related products to its consumers. In the third quarter of 2022, the company posted revenue of $38.8 billion, up 5.6% growth from the same period last year. It also reported a 4.3% year-over-year growth in comparable sales.

(NYSE:HD), growing from 80 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $5.6 billion.Matrix Asset Advisors mentioned The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“During the quarter, we re-established a position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates.

The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”9.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the past years, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy. US equities suffered huge losses in 2022, marking their worst year since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. However, dividend stocks sustained solid footing during the year due to their ability to generate stable income for shareholders. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up 10% from 2021. Moreover, most dividend indexes ended 2022 with positive returns, according to a report by Morningstar. The report also mentioned that there was a 20 percentage-point differential between dividend stocks and the broader market last year.Considering the market volatility and investors’ inclination toward dividend securities, many companies steadily raised their payouts over the years. High inflationary periods also bode well for dividend growth in the past. During the 2010s, dividend payments in the S&amp;P 500 grew by 155% after recording a 40% growth in each of the previous two decades, as reported by CME Group. The report also revealed that dividend payments rose by 6% and 12% during the high-inflation decades of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively.Analysts are positive about dividend growth this year as well.

Even better, over the last five years the combined total return of the Uniform and Related stocks is +149% to crush the benchmarks +52%. With that being said, let’s take a look at the upside left in these two standout Industrial Product stocks.Brief Overview Cintas has an international reach providing specialized services throughout North America with operations in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.Cintas designs, manufactures, and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, and first aid among other safety products for diversified businesses.Similarly, Unifirst’s business involves rental leases and the sale of work clothing, uniforms, protective apparel, career wear, and facility service products with operations in the United States and Europe.Growth Outlook Both Cintas and Unifirst stock land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions.Looking at Cintas, earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have gone up 3% over the last 60 days for fiscal 2023 at $12.68 per share. This would be a 12% increase from fiscal 2022 earnings of $11.28 per share. Plus, earnings are forecasted to grow another 10% in FY24 with earnings estimates slightly up as well over the last two months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are anticipated to grow 11% in FY23 and rise another 6% in FY24 to $9.22 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2024 would be a 34% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $6.89 billion.Pivoting to Unifirst, earnings estimates have gone up 3% over the last 30 days for fiscal 2023 to $7.48 per share. Fiscal 2023 would represent 10% growth from FY22 earnings of $6.81 a share. Even better, earnings are projected to grow another 10% in FY24 with earnings estimates going up 2% over the last month.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnifirst sales are expected to jump 8% in FY23 and rise another 4% in FY24 to $2.25 billion. More importantly, with 2019 sales at $1.80 billion, fiscal 2024 would be a 25% increase from pre-pandemic levels.Performance &amp; Valuation The solid top and bottom line growth make Cintas and Unifirst stock look poised to continue their strong performances as the broader market and economy have struggled amid higher inflation.Over the last year, Cintas stock is up +15% Vs. Unifirst’s +2% with both noticeably outperforming the S&amp;P 500’s -9%. Looking at the last decade, when including dividends, Cintas’s total return is now an astonishing +1,069% to easily top the broader market although UniFirst’s +149% has lagged the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile Cintas’s performance has topped its peer, Unifirst’s valuation stands out with UNF stock trading at $195 per share and 25.6X forward earnings. Unifirst trades 24% below its decade-high of 34X and closer to the median of 23.6X.As for Cintas, its stock trades at $440 per share and 34.5X forward earnings which is 18% beneath its own decade-long high of 42.3X but further above the median of 26.8X. The expected growth of both stocks in the upcoming years supports their valuations despite trading higher than the benchmark’s 18.1X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividends Taking a glance at dividends, Cintas’s 1.05% annual dividend yield slightly tops Unifirst’s 0.65% with both stocks’ dividends lagging the S&amp;P 500’s average yield of 1.5%.However, their respectable return to shareholders has certainly been a plus considering Cintas and Unifirst stock have outperformed the broader market over the last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Cintas and Unifirst stocks are both viable options for exposure in the Industrial Products sector and while their business models are similar there should be more than enough room for both companies as it relates to uniform services. This space looks set to expand considering Cintas continued dominance and Unifirst’s expansive growth over the last few years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WMT a trending ticker on Yahoo Finance today. The largest employer in the US announcing today it's increasing starting pay from $12 to $14 an hour. The retailer says more than 300,000 US workers will see a raise in their March paycheck. Walmart says hourly workers currently earn an average of around $17 an hour. Rivals Target and Amazon have a $15 an hour minimum wage. The unemployment rate, though, it's still near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The Fed currently estimates it will increase to 4.6% in 2023.Now Walmart shares mostly flat. Today didn't really move on this news, mostly flat this year and up less than 2% over the last 12 months. I talk about that unemployment rate, 50-year low, Seana, because this is another one of those stories, like the stories we mentioned earlier in the show, might not be what the Fed wants to see as wages continue to increase, as they'd like to see them come down.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, because that adds obviously to the inflationary pressure, something that the Fed has been trying to get under control now for some time. But obviously, for Americans, this is a huge. This is amazing. This is obviously way overdue when you take into account how much more people are paying this year because of inflation, how many states have not raised their minimum wages yet. So another company here stepping up and raising the wage once again. Obviously, very good.You mentioned, though, that it's still below some of its competitors, which stuck out to me because the fact that job openings still so high, millions and millions of job openings here in the US, so many companies like Walmart having a very tough time recruiting the workers, getting the workers they need through their doors. I would have thought that maybe they would have raised it to 15 bucks an hour.JOSH SCHAFER: I was going to say, $1 below Amazon, you would think right there, you just matched them simply just to, on your surface, say that you pay just as much as Amazon, right? It's only $1. I don't think that's going to cost them that much. It probably would have been a better look.]"

QuoteWhat Our Quantitative Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Marsh &amp; McLennan this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Marsh &amp; McLennan has an Earnings ESP of +0.36% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.41 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MMC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to NoteRevenues of Marsh &amp; McLennan are likely to have benefited on the back of solid contributions from Risk and Insurance Services as well as Consulting segments in the fourth quarter. The Risk and Insurance Services segment is expected to have been aided by the strong performances of its sub-units — Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Performances of both sub-divisions are expected to have gained on business generation and solid retention rates in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MMC’s Risk and Insurance Services segment’s revenues is pegged at $3,162 million, indicating an improvement of 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level and higher than our estimate of $2,968 million. The consensus mark for adjusted operating income of the segment stands at $682 million, suggesting 22.4% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at Marsh and Guy Carpenter sub-units hints toward increases of 0.8% and 22.4%, from their respective prior-year quarter reported numbers.The Consulting segment of Marsh &amp; McLennan is likely to have been favored by strong contributions from its branches — Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Continued solid demand for workforce transformation solutions and sound contribution from those geographies, wherein MMC operates, are expected to have contributed to the sub-units' performance in the fourth quarter. However, persistent inflationary pressures putting strain on equity and fixed-income markets are likely to have offset the segment’s revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consulting segment’s revenues is pegged at $2,128 million, which indicates growth of 1.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric stands at $2,112.6 million. The consensus mark for the segment’s adjusted operating income stands at $383 million, suggesting a 6.6% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Mercer sub-division indicates a 0.8% dip from the prior-year quarter’s level, while the same for Oliver Wyman revenues suggests 6% growth.However, MMC’s margins are expected to have taken a hit from escalating compensation and benefits costs, coupled with expenses related to talent investments in the to-be-reported quarter.Per the last earnings call, foreign exchange is expected to have an adverse impact of 7 cents per share on Marsh &amp; McLennan’s margins in the fourth quarter. Management estimated interest expenses of $121 million in the to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the insurance space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Aon plc AON currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

Gains from the recent acquisitions are also likely to have contributed to DOV’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s margins have been gaining from a strong volume, an improved price-cost spread and tight cost controls for a while, offsetting the negative impacts of supply-chain constraints, input inflation and production disruptions. These are likely to have driven DOV’s profitability in the fourth quarter.Segmental EstimatesIn the Engineered Products segment, the demand for engineered products, vehicle service and industrial automation has been strong, which is expected to get reflected in the December-end quarter’s top-line results.

This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Still, earnings acceleration works better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that most successful stocks have seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company's earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't yet caught the attention of investors. Once secured, it will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.An increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may, at times, drag prices down.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 17. Here are three stocks from the 17 to keep an eye on:bluebird bio is focused on developing gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. Presently, BLUE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). BLUE's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 44.5%.

A Suncor refinery in Commerce City, Colorado, has remained offline since the storm.A lot of overhauls were also delayed by the pandemic, and refiners are now planning twice as many overhauls this spring than usual, putting more pressure on fuel supplies.Fuel inventories are low relative to historical levels, ""so there is little margin for error,"" said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise.

At the same time, it has moved to cut its own emissions and supported government efforts to crack down on oil and gas operators to find and fix gas leaks.Exxon said its embrace of tighter methane regulation is designed to put oil and gas producers on equal footing. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas.""It levels the playing field,"" Exxon's chief environmental scientist Matt Kolesar said in an interview. ""We need strong regulations so it doesn't matter who owns the facility"" or where they operate around the world.LOW HANGING FRUITBurning less gas during production is an easy way to curb greenhouse gas emissions and increase gas production, according to consultants Rystad Energy.Still, Exxon remains opposed to making oil companies responsible for emissions from the use of products sold to consumers. Some oil companies such as Europeans Shell and BP have included emissions by customers in their 2050 net-zero targets.Exxon counters that focusing on methane, which can be up to 80 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, is a better route to slowing climate change.""It is by far the most cost effective"" decarbonization strategy available in the industry, Kolesar said.As a next step, Exxon plans to launch a satellite to begin track greenhouse gas emissions in the Permian by year-end -the first of 24 satellites to be deployed globally in the next three years in association with climate monitoring firm Scepter Inc, said David Scott, Exxon's general manager in the basin.Story continuesSome changes to its production in the Permian have been minor, such as adding a small compressor to push natural gas to a pipeline. Those costs are more than offset by the value of the gas sold, Scott said.Exxon is allocating $17 billion through 2027 to lower its greenhouse gas emissions globally. The money will primarily go toward reducing emissions from oil, gas and chemicals production, including burying CO2 underground.Environmentalists say coupling emissions cuts with increased oil and gas production is short-sighted. ""Companies need to reduce their oil production, not only emissions,"" says Robin Schneider, executive director with environmental group Texas Campaign for the Environment.European oil companies that are moving to develop solar and wind power are offering a better approach to apply today's high oil prices to accelerate their transition to renewable fuels, Schneider said.PERMIAN FIRSTExxon is starting with 700 sites in the U.S. Permian basin to end routine flaring globally by 2030. It installed acoustic sensors, optical gas imaging cameras, additional pipelines and is expanding technology to quickly shut down operations remotely if needed.Most of its U.S. shale operations are in New Mexico, one of the few states which already limits gas flaring. Exxon reached a flaring intensity of 0.4% at the end of 2022 in the Permian, still behind rivals like Norway's Equinor and Brazil's Petrobras, which face stricter local regulations.Exxon's goal of halting all flaring by 2030 is shared by Chevron and BP. London-based Shell, which sold the bulk of its U.S. shale assets, aim to halt most of its global routine flaring by 2025.The amount of gas flared globally is almost equivalent to all the natural gas Europe was importing annually from Russia before sanctions against Moscow last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).At last year's peak U.S. price of $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the waste gas amounted to $55 billion sent into the atmosphere, the IEA said.(Reporting by Sabrina Valle; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Under the plan, it intends to lay off approximately 10% of its total global workforce, exit real estate and shut down office spaces in certain markets.This customer-management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Revenues are expected to be $7.99 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Salesforce.com, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

The inflation rate was at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate to its highest level in 15 years and its strict monetary tightening raised the risk-free market interest rate to a two-decade high. A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth sectors like consumer discretionary.However, as we have entered 2023, consumer discretionary has shown an initial sign of revival. Month to date, of the 11 broad sectors of the market’s benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) has gained 9.3%, second only to the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) that has rallied 12.6%.At this stage, investment in consumer discretionary stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should become fruitful. Five such stocks are - Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL and NIKE Inc. NKE.     Consumer Discretionary Sector to Revive in 2023The consumer discretionary sector is set to revive its fortune this year. Here are the reasons:(1) Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.(2) The Fed raised  the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% in 2022 to the range of 4.25-4.5%. Market is currently expecting the central  bank to increase the interest rate by maximum 75 basis points in 2023. Some financial analysts are expecting the first rate cut to come in the last quarter of 2023 or in early 2024.(3) Headwinds of the pandemic are also behind us. China is gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Story continues(4) The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks with strong potential for 2023.

70,9c6607d2-f276-31fc-a237-6a1137ed8127,NWS,2023-01-25,Rupert Murdoch has decided against reuniting his two media firms that he split up 10 years ago,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-decided-against-reuniting-092700771.html,1674638820.0,STORY,"['TROW', 'FOXA', 'NWSA', 'DIS']","[Media baron Rupert Murdoch abandoned his plans to merge Fox Corp and News Corp, the two media companies he controls.Both companies said their board of directors received letters from Murdoch “withdrawing the proposal to explore a potential combination of News Corp and Fox Corporation.” Together with his eldest son Lachlan, Murdoch determined that combining the two entities “is not optimal for shareholders” of either company at this time.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureFox operates news channels Fox News, Fox Sports, and Fox TV Stations. News Corp is the parent of publications such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and publisher HarperCollins. The Murdoch family owns about 40% of both companies. The Special Committees set up at both firms to explore the potential merger have been dissolved.Investors rejoice over the scrapped Fox-News Corp dealMurdoch had pursued a merger as a way to secure a bigger resource pool for further acquisitions, but investors saw little merit in overcomplicating a swelling business instead of simplifying it.They welcomed Murdoch’s change of heart. “This is the right decision,” said Adam Katz, co-founder and chief investment officer at activist investor Irenic, which owns 2.6% of the class B voting shares of News Corp.When the talks started, Irenic was among the first companies to object to a merger, suggesting that a spin-off of News Corp’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones was a better option.Soon after, Independent Franchise Partners, a bigger investor that owns 7% of News Corp’s Class A shares and 6.4% in Fox Corp, also pushed back on the deal in November. Then, T. Rowe Price, which owns almost 18% of News Corp, joined the growing chorus opposing the deal.“It’s more constructive to help form the process than try to push back against any proposal once it’s been made,” Vincent DeAugustino, one of the portfolio managers who oversees T. Rowe’s investment in News Corp, said at the time.Story continuesQuotable: Thumbs down for Fox-News Corp merger“Every investor I’ve spoken to in the last 10 years on News Corp has expressed that they think the company is way too complicated and should be simplified by selling assets or spinning off assets. Putting the two (News Corp and Fox) together makes no sense to us.” —Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research Partners.A brief history of the Fox and News Corp split and possible reunionJune 2013: Murdoch splits his $75 billion (at the time) News Corp into two—one is the loss-making publishing arm that retains the name, and the other is the more profitable Hollywood studio 21st Century Fox.March 2019: Murdoch sells 21st Century Fox to Disney for over $71 billion. The deal included movie production arms 20th Century, TV studios, a range of Fox’s cable channels, its 30% share of Hulu streaming, and more. Fox retained its news channel, sports channel, and a handful of others.October 2022: Murdoch writes letters to the boards at Fox and News Corp, asking them to consider a merger. The reunited entity would be worth around $26 billion, putting it in the league of Warner Bros Discovery, albeit far behind behemoths like Disney and Comcast.Was the Fox-News Corp deal a veiled succession planning attempt?When talk of the merger started, rumours swirled about 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan. But the company issued a staunch rebuttal.“The proposal is 100% based on business rationale. Any commentary that implies it has to do with succession planning is absurd and comes from sources with no knowledge of the strategy,” a spokesman for Murdoch told Reuters in November.Related stories🏠 Rupert Murdoch is officially a remote worker now💰 Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox because even his media giant was too small to compete🎬 Everything Disney’s takeover of Fox means for the future of entertainmentMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

On a positive note, amid the ongoing supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business has been in high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth on account of telehealth and remote monitoring services. Added to this, with digitization, retail industry players are significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for stalwarts within the industry like CVS Health CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Rite Aid RAD, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.However, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of drug pricing and reimbursement. Further, with a decline in the severity of COVID-19, the demand for related retail health support has decreased meaningfully, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players. Last but not the least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there has been a number of new entries in this industry, increasing the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon’s AMZN entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potentials of this industry,  non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores IndustryIndustry Trend Remains Dismal Amid Reimbursement Pressure: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, the low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials of drugs. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down the mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.Amazon’s Entry Steals Market Share: A Business Insider report in 2021 came up with the speculation that there have been discussions about Amazon setting up standalone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Further, per the report, which cites insider sources, Amazon is exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations. Earlier, following its entry, the e-commerce giant grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market from the legacy retail drug store space. Amazon Pharmacy’s omichannel performance has been significantly robust since the inception. Going by a Viseven report of Jan 5, 2023, Amazon’s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention that help to cover previous sales reductions. This has already significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. Needless to say, the speculation of Amazon planning to enter the Brick-And-Mortar space has come as a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.Online Pharmacy and Mail Order Boom: The widespread shelter-in-place regulations since the beginning of the pandemic have created a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Experts say that this transition is expected to last even after the pandemic is over. Data claims that COVID-19 has only accelerated the already-growing demand for e-pharmacy and mail-ordered home delivery systems. Going by a Patch report, “Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal.” With Amazon’s big move into the healthcare space, the retail pharmacy industry entered a new phase of fierce competition. To counter this rivalry, the companies are strategically attempting to gain in size and scale.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term ProspectsThe industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

Please refresh for updates.3M (NYSE:MMM) stock fell 4.5% after the company missed its forecasts for the fourth quarter, reporting a drop in both revenue and profit, hurt by the strong dollar and by a charge to exit the manufacture of 'forever chemicals'. It forecast a further drop in sales and profit this year.  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock fell 2.3%, reversing initial gains after CEO Larry Culp said he expected 2023 to be a difficult year, especially for its power business. GE expects that division to lose around $400 million this year, while its aerospace division is facing a much brighter outlook. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock fell 2.3% after the mobile phone giant issued 2023 guidance below expectations. The US's biggest cell carrier said it sees adjusted EPS between $4.55-4.85 a share, some 5% below consensus forecasts at the midpoint of the range. Its fourth quarter profit also missed forecasts despite surprisingly strong subscriber growth. Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) stock fell 1.4% after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) expanded its presence in the healthcare sector with a new subscription plan for generic drugs. The service, known as RxPass, may draw business away from Walgreens' chain of pharmacies. Amazon stock also fell, with investors showing little appetite for what is likely to be another loss leader.

Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) stock edged lower while  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) stock rose over 1% after the two defense giants reported mixed fortunes in their fourth quarters. Lockheed warned that high inflation would eat into its profit margins in the coming year, but the positive secular outlook for defense spending allayed any disappointment. D.R.

91,e551a896-c30d-3dc8-8bf5-684a5f8a4226,SYY,2023-01-25,Sysco (SYY) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sysco-syy-reports-next-week-150003996.html,1674572403,STORY,['SYY'],"[Sysco (SYY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +45.6%.Revenues are expected to be $18.73 billion, up 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.52% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sysco?For Sysco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sysco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sysco would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of -2.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sysco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season, in addition to featuring new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), BHP Group Limited (BHP) and Accenture plc (ACN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;2022 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the reports that came out this morning, we now have Q4 results from 72 S&amp;P 500 or 14.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 72 index members are down -7.5% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues, with 68.1% beating EPS estimates and 65.3% beating revenues estimates. Relative to historical periods, the Q4 beats percentages are on the low side, particularly for EPS beats. The 68.1% EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members compares to 72.2% in the preceding quarter (2022 Q3) and a 20-quarter average of 78.2%. Over the preceding 20-quarter period, the EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members has been as high as 88.9% (in 2021 Q2) and as low as 61.1% (2020 Q1). The beats pecentages on the revenue side are also  on the lower side relative to the preceding 20-quarter period, but not as pronounced as with the EPS beats percentages. This trend of lower beats percentages could change as we go through the remainder of the Q4 reporting cycle. But if it persists, it would indicate that Q4 estimates hadn't fallen as much as was warranted by underlying business conditions. Since management teams are typically quite adept at anchoring such expectations, one could even argue that the shortfall likely took even management teams by surprise. We will see how this trend evolves over the remainder of this reporting cycle, but we are not seeing its direct follow through in estimates for the current period (2023 Q1). Story continuesS&amp;P 500 earnings for 2023 Q1 are currently expected to be down -4.3% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues.

If you use the mobile app, you can transfer up to $500 per week.4. Wise (formerly Transferwise)If you need to send money overseas, Wise sets the bar other transfer services follow. Wise is transparent about the low fees they charge. Enter the amount you’d like to send and you’ll see a breakdown of how much it will cost you.

For the fastest transfers, card payments are instant; bank transfers may take two business days.5.

Walmart MoneyCenter has a free estimator tool that will not only tell you the exact fee you can expect to pay, but also the exchange rates.7. PayPalPayPal has several ways to send money quickly. Send a transfer to an email address, request funds or use a custom PayPal.Me link. If the person you send money to does not have a PayPal account, they can open one from free right away.There are no transfer fees when you use a linked bank account or PayPal balance to send money. You can also use a debit or credit card for a fee of 2.9% of the amount. Instant transfers are available when you need to exchange money right away. Standard transfers into a bank account take one to three business days.8. VenmoVenmo calls money transfers “sharing payments” due to the social nature of the service. Over 70 million people use Venmo to send and receive money from friends and family. You can split bills and invite Venmo users to chip in, send or receive money and pay a growing number of businesses. Opening a Venmo account is free — and so is sending and receiving money unless you fund the transfer with a credit card. Card transfer fees are 3% but the fee can be avoided, thanks to the other options available to send money.9. Cash AppCash App was developed by Square] as a good way to send money between app holders for free — if you don’t mind the funds arriving in one to three business days. You could always pay a 1.5% fee ($0.25 minimum) if you need the funds deposited into a debit card right away. To use Cash App, you need is a phone number, email address or $Cashtag, which uniquely identifies you or your recipient. Cash App only supports transfers within or between the U.S. and the U.K at this time.10.

If you receive cash via Google Pay, you can transfer it from your wallet straight to your linked debit card for free in minutes. Transfer up to $5,000 per transaction if you’re verified. Otherwise, you’re limited to $500.How To Send Money OnlineUse one of the following methods via one of the top money transfer services mentioned above to send money online to friends instantly:Money in MinutesDownload Western Union’s app or bring up your account on a laptop.Log in and select the “Money in Minutes” service.Enter the name and address of the intended recipient in the appropriate boxes.Select the debit or credit card you’d like to use to send the money.Enter the amount and submit your request.

Presently, Clip is in over 300 US locations across 34 States, as the company reported last week.Invicta is using the Clip solution across multiple store locations, with plans to roll out the solution to additional stores in Q1’23. Invicta stores utilizing the Clip solution can make cash deposits to their existing bank account at a convenient ClipDrop on shopping mall premise and at select Staples Store locations instead of going to their bank branch to manage cash. Deposits can be made any time during retail business hours by designated employees. As a Clip customer, Invicta has access to powerful technology through the ClipApp to manage their cash, assign employees to perform deposit transactions, track transaction history, and collect cash and payment analytics. They also receive next business day credit for their deposits which improves cash flow and saves precious employee time and resources.“Clip is a massive time-saver. Depositing cash at a ClipDrop on premise opposed to going to a bank branch means our staff can remain in-store to help Invicta customers select the best watches for themselves or loved ones,” explained Erik Cruz, Senior Field Operations &amp; Implementation Manager for Invicta Stores. “Being able to track deposits streamlines our accounting efforts as well; having that time back to focus on our customers is a gift.”Jewelry and accessory retailers are a category that Clip receives regular interest from as they tend to face unique challenges related to cash management. Many have shared that a significant percentage of their transactions are made in cash. To resolve the stresses that can come with leaving the mall to make cash deposits, stores like Invicta are embracing Clip as a refreshing way to deposit smarter and safer.Story continuesJoseph Arrage, Clip co-founder and CEO, discusses the frustration he hears from retailers in this space most often: “Retailers like Invicta generously share concerns with us from corporate offices and store management which inform Clip’s overall approach to cash management. Retailers in the jewelry and accessory space need staff to focus their time on customer service, but that’s impossible with an inefficient, outdated system that takes staff away from the customer for banking tasks. We are honored that a brand like Invicta, who has been trusted by consumers for nearly two centuries, has entrusted their cash management to Clip.”To learn more, please visit www.clipmoney.com, and for a full list of locations, visit https://clipmoney.com/locationsAbout ClipClip Money, Inc.

The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $15.5 billion indicates a 3% increase from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate suggests 1.4% year-over-year growth.HCA Healthcare beat the consensus estimate for earnings in two of the prior four quarters and missed on two occasions, with the average being 2.3%. This is depicted in the graph below:HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. price-eps-surprise | HCA Healthcare, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteIn the fourth quarter, HCA Healthcare’s revenues are expected to have gained on improved patient volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equivalent admissions hints at a 4.8% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric suggests 6.3% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for equivalent patient days indicates a 0.7% year-over-year increase, whereas our estimate suggests a 0.4% jump. This is likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in profit levels. The consensus mark and our estimate for the total number of hospitals are both pegged at 183, up from 182 reported a year ago.Story continuesThe consensus mark and our estimate for the occupancy rate are both pegged at 70% for the fourth quarter. Similarly, the consensus mark and our estimate for outpatient surgery cases both indicate 2.8% year-over-year growth.However, the consensus mark and our estimate for inpatient surgery cases both indicate a 0.6% year-over-year decrease. The bottom line of HCA Healthcare is expected to have suffered from continued labor challenges, an issue that has been plaguing the industry for quite some time.Another potential constraint affecting the whole nation is the persistent inflationary impact on expenses that is likely to have dampened HCA's margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for HCA Healthcare this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which Schlumberger falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share, indicating a change of +76.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.1%. This estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.77 indicates a change of +25.5% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +27.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.71 billion and $36.32 billion estimates indicate +16.4% and +11% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.6%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was +2.9%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.07%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.31%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.22%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil refiner had gained 2.89% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 3.05% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.64% in that time.Phillips 66 will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Phillips 66 to post earnings of $4.34 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 47.62%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $36.85 billion, up 9.77% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Phillips 66.

122,c21d3d07-1d7b-3962-b2a3-48ec881593de,PSX,2023-01-25,Phillips 66 (PSX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-earnings-expected-150003344.html,1674572403,STORY,"['PSX', 'VLO']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Phillips 66 (PSX) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +47.6%.Revenues are expected to be $36.85 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.78% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Phillips 66?For Phillips 66, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Phillips 66 will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Phillips 66 would post earnings of $4.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.46, delivering a surprise of +29.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Phillips 66 doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, Valero Energy (VLO), is soon expected to post earnings of $7.45 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +201.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $40.97 billion, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Valero Energy has been revised 21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2023.The FPSO is a crucial component of one of the world’s most innovative gas projects, the GTA development. The GTA development includes subsea development of gas fields and near-shore floating LNG facilities. The project’s first phase is expected to produce 2.3 million tons of LNG each year.The FPSO will produce around 500 million standard cubic feet of gas per day with eight processing and production modules. The FPSO will process natural gas by removing condensate, water and other impurities.After that, the gas will be exported to the project’s offshore floating LNG facilities. Most of the gas will be liquefied by the floating LNG facilities, allowing export to international markets. Some are allocated to help meet the rising demand in Mauritania and Senegal.Regarding BP’s recent activities in Mauritania, the company signed an exploration and production sharing contract last year for the BirAllah gas resource. It also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Mauritania government for large-scale production of green hydrogen in the country. BP and partners continue progressing on the proposed Yakaar-Teranga gas-to-power project offshore Senegal.The FPSO departure is an important milestone for the GTA project, which is the epitome of BP’s strong hydrocarbon strategy. With the constant support of its partners, BP remains committed to helping Mauritania and Senegal to develop their world-class resources sustainably.Price PerformanceShares of BP have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stock is up an impressive 102% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 13% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 6.0% in the last three months.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, TJX Companies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.4% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 15% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on TJX Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for TJX Companies the TSR over the last 5 years was 117%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that TJX Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 20% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for TJX Companies  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.TJX Companies is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

The rising prices and margins are unusual for this time of year, when travel falls.The crack spread, a key gauge of refiner profits that measures the difference between crude oil prices and selling prices of finished products, touched $42.41 on Tuesday, the highest since October. The five-year January average is $15.56, an analysis of Refinitiv Eikon data showed.Average gasoline prices in Texas hit about $3.07 a gallon on Tuesday, up almost 44 cents from a month ago, according to the AAA motor group. Motorists in Oklahoma also are paying about 45 cents more, at $3.13 a gallon, AAA data showed.A diesel producing unit at PBF Energy's Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery was shut following a fire on Saturday. It could be out for at least a month. Exxon Mobil said Monday it will perform planned maintenance on several units at its Baytown, Texas, petrochemical complex.The ongoing refinery maintenance season could be much lengthier than usual, with many U.S. Gulf Coast refineries still running below capacity after Winter Storm Elliott knocked out some 1.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity in December. A Suncor refinery in Commerce City, Colorado, has remained offline since the storm.A lot of overhauls were also delayed by the pandemic, and refiners are now planning twice as many overhauls this spring than usual, putting more pressure on fuel supplies.Fuel inventories are low relative to historical levels, ""so there is little margin for error,"" said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise.

(UNAUDITED)DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS(a) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end.(b) Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of year end.(c) Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.(d) Return on sales is calculated as net earnings divided by revenue.(e) Return on equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by our average total equity during the year. Average total equity is calculated using the total equity balance at the end of the preceding year and the total equity balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented.(f) We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management.(g) We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as net earnings plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and average shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. Average debt and average shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss are calculated using the respective balances at the end of the preceding year and the respective balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance.(h) We define net debt as short- and long-term debt (total debt) less cash and equivalents. We believe net debt is a useful measure for investors because it reflects the borrowings that support our operations and capital deployment strategy. We use net debt as an important indicator of liquidity and financial position. EXHIBIT H BACKLOG - (UNAUDITED)DOLLARS IN MILLIONSFundedUnfundedTotalBacklogEstimatedPotentialContract Value*Total EstimatedContract ValueFourth Quarter 2022:Aerospace$            19,077$                 439$            19,516$                     685$                20,201Marine Systems26,24619,45345,6993,67249,371Combat Systems12,72652513,2515,36418,615Technologies9,1003,57112,67126,88939,560Total$            67,149$            23,988$            91,137$                36,610$              127,747Third Quarter 2022:Aerospace$            18,536$                 516$            19,052$                     773$                19,825Marine Systems26,96615,27342,2393,26345,502Combat Systems13,30553413,8395,75419,593Technologies10,1303,57313,70327,16240,865Total$            68,937$            19,896$            88,833$                36,952$              125,785Fourth Quarter 2021:Aerospace$            15,878$                 415$            16,293$                  1,657$                17,950Marine Systems23,67821,17744,8554,27149,126Combat Systems12,58450913,0936,93620,029Technologies9,0054,34813,35326,99740,350Total$            61,145$            26,449$            87,594$                39,861$              127,455*  The estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and     unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, including options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase    new aircraft and aircraft services.

Yet, these types of ""boring"" stocks might actually be what you need right now.See the List: GOBankingRates' Best Banks of 2023Important: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Learn: How 2023 Recession Will Differ From 2008 and How You Should Prepare DifferentlyAt the end of the day, the stock market is not a ""get-rich-quick"" scheme. Many of the same meme stocks that shot up overnight have also turned those gains into huge losses. For many investors, reliable, old-fashioned companies with consistent earnings and dividends are just the ticket for long-term gains, even if they're not the type to jump 50% or more in a single day.As with any investment, be sure to consult with your financial advisor and discuss your investment objectives and risk tolerance before you make any moves. Here's a look at some ""boring"" stocks that may put long-term dollars into your pocket.josefkubes / Shutterstock.com3M (MMM)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $120.65When it comes to so-called ""boring"" stocks, 3M has to be near the top of the list. The venerable maker of such household products as Scotch Tape and Post-It Notes certainly doesn't have the headline-making power of, say, electric vehicle maker Tesla or iPhone maker Apple. Yet, 3M has been a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1976, it has paid dividends to shareholders without interruption for more than 100 years, and it has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years. Currently, the stock's yield sits at an extraordinary 5.03%. Put it all together, and as boring as 3M may seem, stock credentials don't get much more blue-chip than that.Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsKen Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (PSA)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $289.10Public Storage is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the world. This certainly doesn't sound like an exciting business. However, it's a great ""boring"" stock to own due to its consistency. Americans are nothing if not excellent consumers, and in many cases, all of that ""stuff"" becomes too much to store at home. The storage business is a resilient one and can thrive in nearly any type of economy. In recessions, people downsize and need a place to store their things, and in a booming economy, spending picks up and adds to the ""storage of stuff"" problem. Thus, analysts consider this type of business recession-resistant. Currently, the stock is paying an attractive 2.7% yield.Story continuesastudio / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (CAT)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $249.71Caterpillar is another staid member of the old-fashioned Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining 30 years ago in 1991. The average consumer may know that Caterpillar makes machinery like bulldozers, but the company is much more than that. In fact, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel-electric locomotives, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines, to the tune of a whopping $51 billion in revenues in 2021 alone, up 22% over 2020. With a solid dividend yield of 1.95% and a product line that should benefit from a global economic recovery, Caterpillar could be a ""boring"" stock to watch for the long run.ShutterstockAmerican Water Works (AWK)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $151.54When it comes to ""boring"" stocks, utilities are usually at the top of the list. Utilities provide the basic services that all Americans need, such as water and power, and they often aren't popular with consumers, as they issue bills every single month with charges that seem to consistently rise. From an investor's perspective, however, this is what makes utilities attractive to invest in. By providing services that all people need, utilities generate a predictable, consistent revenue stream. This may sound boring, but it puts money directly into investors' pockets.American Water Works is the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility company in America. The need for clean water will always be there, and in the event of water shortages, prices will go up, which benefits investors. The stock has been a long-term, consistent winner and it currently pays a dividend yield of 1.74%.Supannee_Hickman / Shutterstock.comChevron (CVX)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $180.90Unlike most stocks on this list, Chevron actually had two boom years in 2021 and 2022, rising 38.96% and 52.95%, respectively. These are big gains for a company that's traditionally valued for its stability and the size of its large dividend. However, analysts still have a consensus ""buy"" rating on the stock, and if you're looking for consistent income, Chevron's a good choice. Even with the rise of electric vehicles, demand for oil remains huge, and the company's cash flow sustains a hefty 3.17% current dividend, making Chevron a great source of equity income.Bonsales / Shutterstock.comDisney (DIS)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $103.48The Walt Disney Company may make a more exciting product to most people than companies like 3M or Caterpillar, but it's still considered a reliable, ""boring"" stock. Disney could be a stock to take a look at because it is on the cusp of some big changes - and it has also struggled mightily through the pandemic. In Nov. 2022, the Disney board of directors booted pandemic-era CEO Bob Chapek and restored his famed predecessor Bob Iger, who ran the company solidly for 15 years. With the stock down about 44% in 2022 alone, this may be a good time for long-term investors to take another look at one of the most beloved ""boring"" companies on Wall Street. Under Iger's leadership, shareholders will no doubt be looking for recoveries across all of Disney's popular consumer segments, from feature films and streaming to theme parks and cruise ships.ShutterstockNRG Energy (NRG)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $32.21NRG Energy is another utility, like American Water Works, that may sound boring but that could be a good choice for your portfolio. With a current yield at a whopping 4.51%, NRG Energy puts a lot of money in investors' pockets every year. But the power industry's leading company has a lot more going for it looking forward than looking back. Under the Biden administration, more federal money is being allocated to clean energy generation. NRG Energy may benefit from this global push, as the company has three renewable energy plants and is looking to take advantage of this fast-growing area. Even if the Democrats lose power in Washington in coming years, the move towards renewables looks set to continue on a global basis.rvolkan / iStock.comMicrosoft (MSFT)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $240.22Microsoft is another of a large gang of ""old tech"" stocks that in many circles just aren't as exciting anymore, with a new wave of companies like Salesforce.com, Shopify and Square gobbling both headlines and investor interest. Yet, Microsoft is much more than the ""boring"" old tech stock that only sells Windows software. Microsoft has been moving aggressively into cloud services in recent years, and its earnings are starting to reflect a much higher growth profile, including its venture software for electric vehicles. The company's CEO has recently announced some small layoffs and cautioned investors about a bumpy road for tech companies, but these announcements - and the vicious bear market of 2022 - have only served to give long-term investors an entry point on this long-term, ""boring"" winner. After dropping about 29% in 2022, the stock now yields 1.17%, not bad for a growth-oriented tech stock.ivanastar / Getty ImagesLowe's (LOW)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $204.53Lowe's is one of the two companies that dominate the home improvement space, along with Home Depot. Unless you're a contractor, there's nothing really exciting about a company that sells lights, screws, flooring, tools and construction supplies. However, the stock has been exciting indeed for investors, gaining about 95% over the past five years - and dropping ""only"" about 15% in 2022, in the midst of a significant bear market.Lowe's did well during the heart of the pandemic, posting a return of over 98% in 2020 alone as people stayed home and took on renovation projects. However, the long-term prospects of the company are good as well, as foot traffic continues to rise, and its installation services are generating additional revenue. Lowe's certainly has highs and lows as the housing market expands and contracts, but over the long-run, Americans enjoy being homeowners, and there will always be projects to work on. Lowe's also supports a current yield of 2.08%, offering a decent level of income on top of its growth potential.varandah / Shutterstock.comMastercard (MA)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $376.28The business of credit card processing may not seem all that exciting. But it sure can be profitable. With about 83% of Americans owning at least one credit card, a company like Mastercard has an entrenched customer base that is likely to continue spending. While short-term blips like the pandemic or a recession can temporarily slow consumer spending, history has shown that it always picks up and reaches new highs. Every time a customer swipes a Mastercard to pay for these purchases, Mastercard generates revenue. This makes Mastercard the poster child for ""boring"" stocks that can be important to own for your long-term portfolio. Even in 2022, during the midst of a fierce bear market, shares of Mastercard only fell just over 3%.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsDisclaimer: This list of stocks to consider was originally compiled on and is accurate as of January 20, 2023.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Boring Stocks That Are Important for Your Portfolio]"

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Enel (ENLAY) is a stock many investors are watching right now. ENLAY is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 9.70 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 14.47. ENLAY's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.84 and as low as 6.82, with a median of 8.56, all within the past year.We also note that ENLAY holds a PEG ratio of 1.36. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ENLAY's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.13. Within the past year, ENLAY's PEG has been as high as 1.60 and as low as 0.95, with a median of 1.19.Investors should also recognize that ENLAY has a P/B ratio of 1.25. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. ENLAY's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.13. ENLAY's P/B has been as high as 1.58 and as low as 0.78, with a median of 1.12, over the past year.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Utility - Electric Power value stock, take a look at NRG Energy (NRG). NRG is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of NRG Energy are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.46 and a PEG ratio of 0.54 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 14.47 and 2.13, respectively.NRG's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.06 and as low as 2.87, with a median of 8.56. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.24, as low as 0.13, with a median of 0.69.Additionally, NRG Energy has a P/B ratio of 1.45 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.13. For NRG, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.78, as low as 1.39, with a median of 1.89 over the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Enel and NRG Energy are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, ENLAY and NRG sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is the third-largest U.S. energy company by market value, trailing only oil and gas giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp.Juno Beach, Florida-based NextEra's fourth-quarter revenue of $6.16 billion fell short of Wall Street estimates of $6.55 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted profit of 51 cents per share, however, beat estimates of 49 cents per share.The company said Eric Silagy, head of NextEra subsidiary Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL), America's largest electric utility, would retire after more than 11 years at the helm. He will be succeeded by Armando Pimentel.A political watchdog group filed a complaint last year with the U.S. Federal Election Commission, saying FPL violated Florida election laws. NextEra CEO John Ketchum said an internal review should show FPL would not be liable for violating any laws, but added that this and other issues may have contributed to Silagy's retirement.""When you think about all the challenges that he had to overcome with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation in the supply chain and the media allegations and all those things ... I think it took a toll,"" he told analysts on the conference call.Previous executives had generally served for about a decade, Silagy said on the call.Analysts at Morningstar said the decline in shares on Wednesday could be related to Silagy's retirement and regulatory uncertainty.Story continuesThe company's clean energy unit logged its best year for new renewables and storage growth, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to its backlog. NextEra is banking on increased use of renewable energy like solar and wind for power generation amid a global push to shift to cleaner fuel sources.That move accelerated last year following sanctions on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, which sent gas and oil prices soaring. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act should increase spending on renewable projects, Ketchum said.""We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade,"" he said.The power sector last year was battered by extreme weather conditions. NextEra was hit by $53 million in storm restoration costs during the quarter.Natural gas prices averaged $6.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the October-December quarter, about 26% higher than the previous year.(Reporting by Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi, Shailesh Kuber and Maju Samuel)]"

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Enel SpA and NextEra Energy are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ENLAY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NEE has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ENLAY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.39, while NEE has a forward P/E of 26.62. We also note that ENLAY has a PEG ratio of 1.31. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.76.Another notable valuation metric for ENLAY is its P/B ratio of 1.20. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.51.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ENLAY's Value grade of A and NEE's Value grade of D.ENLAY stands above NEE thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ENLAY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc.

Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.Brian Doubles : Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony closed the year on a very strong note with fourth quarter net earnings of $577 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.1%. These financial results contributed to full year 2022 net earnings of over $3 billion or $6.15 per diluted share, our second highest in company history; a return on average assets of 3.1% and a return on tangible common equity of 28.5%. This performance was driven by continued strength across the fundamental drivers of our business and a high level of execution across our key strategic priorities throughout the year. We achieved record purchase volume of $180 billion for the full year, which surpassed our prior year's record and was 15% higher on a core basis.Story continuesSpend per active account was 7% higher for the year, reflecting robust consumer demand across the broad range of products and services for which Synchrony offers flexible financing. We also acquired 23.6 million new accounts and grew average active accounts by 8% on a core basis. The combination of strong consumer spend and some moderation in payment rate contributed to ending receivables growth of 15%. As expected, credit continued to normalize across our portfolio with full year losses of 3%, still more than 250 basis points below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, which is generally the level at which our risk-adjusted margin is more fully optimized. And finally, Synchrony continued to drive progress toward our long-term operating efficiency target, reflecting the combined impacts of our cost discipline, the inherent operating leverage in our highly scalable model and strong revenue growth.Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent growth and strong returns is a testament to our well-diversified portfolio, our balanced approach to product and credit strategies, our compelling value propositions and the strength of our business model. As a result, Synchrony was able to return more than $3.8 billion of capital to shareholders during 2022, $3.3 billion of which was through share repurchase, a 17% reduction in our shares outstanding. When we look back on 2022 and the caliber results we were able to deliver for our customers, our partners and providers and our shareholders, it really all comes back to the dedication shared by the Synchrony team as we realize our ultimate goal: to power commerce by delivering a leading digital ecosystem, connecting our partners and customers through world-class technology, products and capabilities.Over the last year, Synchrony has built upon the core strengths of our differentiated business model by executing on the key strategic priorities that are driving progress towards that collective goal. We continue to expand and enhance our partner programs, including the addition of more than 30 partners and the renewal of more than 50 relationships, including most recently Lowe's, with whom we've partnered for over four decades to drive innovation and value to both their do-it-yourself and pro customers. Synchrony also continued to diversify our products, programs and markets during 2022, deepening our reach and expanding the utility and value we offer to our customers and partners alike. We continue to scale our diverse product suite with the launch of Synchrony's Installment and Pay in 4 products at a number of retailers and providers, including Belk and Discount Tire.These six pay offerings represent another financial tool that we can offer to qualifying customers while also driving incremental sales to our partners and providers. And whether it's delivering flexible financing offers in a dental practice, connecting a customer with a large partner through a seamless mobile transaction are driving incremental sales at small and midsized businesses. Synchrony meets our customers, partners and providers wherever they are in their digital or retail journey and deliver the right product at the right time. For this reason, we launched a number of strategic partnerships over the last year to expand our distribution channels and broaden customer access to our comprehensive product suite. Through integrations with point-of-sale and business management platforms like Clover, and practice management solutions like Sycle, Synchrony has added hundreds of thousands of small business locations and several thousand provider locations through whom we can seamlessly and responsibly offer access to flexible financing.At year-end, Synchrony had more than 460,000 merchant provider locations and 71 million active customers. So when you think about the sheer size and scale of the constituencies we serve, and the wide range of financing needs we deliver through omnichannel experiences, it should come as no surprise that our dynamic technology platform is at the center of it all. During the last year, Synchrony continued to innovate and scale our digital capabilities to ensure that we can remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving consumer financing landscape. We drove greater mobile customer engagement through a number of initiatives, including both our digital wallet provisioning and the Synchrony app. Accounts provision for digital use in 2022 increased 75% compared to last year contributing to 85% of mobile wallet sales growth.And in terms of our mobile app, we upgraded our site pipelines to the latest version, which delivers new features, including a new user experience, freeze my card, e-statements, autopay, apply and Apple Pay push provisioning. As a result, unique visitors and payments within the SyPi channel each grew by more than 20% compared to last year. In today's tech forward world, a best-in-class customer experience is characterized by seamless, intuitive and hyper-personalized engagement. This, in turn, requires a more comprehensive understanding of each customer as we connect them with partners and providers and anticipate which products and services will optimize the experience. For that reason, we are constantly driving deeper integrations, leveraging more predictive and actionable insights throughout our digital ecosystem and developing solutions that are grounded in our customer experience insights.Over the last year, Synchrony achieved over 70% growth in the number of applications using our APIs and more than 80% growth in API transactions, including from our clients and partners leveraging Synchrony APIs to power their digital experience. Our partnership with PayPal is a great example of how together we continue to leverage more APIs to enhance our offerings and drive an even more seamless experience for their customer. In Q1, we launched PayPal Savings, which enabled instantaneous movement of funds between PayPal balances, no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their financial goals. In addition, existing PayPal customers are able to quickly and easily open their PayPal savings account inside PayPal's Super App.In Q2, we launched our new and refreshed co-branded PayPal Cashback credit card with a best-in-class cash-back offering and a fully integrated experience within the PayPal app, powered by native APIs. And in Q4, we enhanced our everyday value proposition on the Venmo co-branded card by introducing free person-to-person payments, the 3% fee is waived for the consumer when they use their Venmo Visa. We are really pleased with what the PayPal and Synchrony teams have been able to execute as we grow and evolve in new and unique ways, empower top of wallet products and best-in-class experiences for our customers. Synchrony also launched our new cardholder service platform across many of our largest portfolios in 2022. This new platform offers customers the ability to service their accounts in one dashboard, and enables a broad suite of account notifications across every aspect of the credit life cycle.These notifications include a range of instant transaction alerts, all enhanced within rich merchant data and a completely redesigned digital service experience. In addition to text and e-mail alerts, we are able to deliver these notifications and alerts directly within our partners' iOS and Android apps by leveraging our patented SyPi platform, continuing to enhance the customers' experience within our partners' brands. While this new account manager is still in its early stages, we observed some strong trends in response to the launch. 60% of those logging in have more than one account, and 80% of our users stated that their experience was easy or very easy to use and a top driver of their satisfaction. In fact, this more dynamic interface has achieved a double-digit improvement in our transactional Net Promoter Score compared to our previous account management site.This new platform will span the broad set of financial products that Synchrony offers and will enable intuitive, self-service and highly customized and personalized experiences, increased speed to market of features and solutions for our partners and a more effective way for Synchrony to engage and power and deepen our relationships. Accordingly, as we continue to scale and integrate more of our products in the coming year, we believe this enhanced account manager will become an increasingly powerful tool to drive higher quality engagement and deeper value for our customers, partners and Synchrony alike. To that end, we also remain focused on driving greater connectivity across our vast customer and partner basis with the expansion of our Synchrony marketplace.Mysynchrony.com connects customers with information and relevant offers from brands that they trust. These offers are powered by proprietary insights that Synchrony has gleaned through a variety of resources, including online search activity within their shopping category and location to provide personalized offers to the right audience at the right time. As we continue to enhance this level of personalization and launch capabilities, like prequalification within our marketplace over the last year, mysynchrony.com achieved a 25% increase in both new accounts and sales as well as 11% growth in referrals to our partners. This is a testament to the deep customer relationships that our network products foster. Synchrony's ability to leverage our marketplaces like mysynchrony.com or carecredit.com to drive new and existing customer traffic as well as incremental and repeat sales to our partners has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator and an important growth driver for our business longer term.In summary, Synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customers looking to make a purchase or a payment. Big or small, in-person or digitally, we can meet them whenever and however they want to be met with a broad range of products and services to meet their needs in any given moment. This ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners and providers alike is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss fourth quarter financial performance in greater detail.Brian Wenzel : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's strong fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of Synchrony's purpose-built business model at work. The diversification of our portfolio across industries and spend categories supported by sophisticated underwriting and disciplined credit management enabled continued purchase volume growth that surpassed last year's record level. In addition, the alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners through our retailer share arrangements is performing as intended. Excluding the impact of portfolio sales, our RSA declined as credit losses continue to normalize and funding costs began to rise, enabling Synchrony's delivery of consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns as we have done for many years.The scalability and efficiency of our dynamic technology platform is enabling operating leverage even as we invest in our business. And Synchrony's strong balance sheet continue to support our customers and partners as their own needs evolve. In combination, these business drivers have continued to uniquely position Synchrony in our ability to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers and our partners and consistent returns to our shareholders even as market conditions change. Let's now discuss Synchrony's fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Purchase volume grew 2% to $47.9 billion, reflecting a 3% higher spend per account versus last year. On a core basis, purchase volume grew 11%. This continued strength in purchase volume was broad-based across our portfolio, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our five sales platforms, the compelling value propositions we offer and continued consumer demand.At the platform level, Synchrony achieved double-digit growth in our Diversified &amp; Value, Health &amp; Wellness and Digital platforms and single-digit growth in our Home &amp; Auto and Lifestyle platforms. More specifically, in Diversified &amp; Value, purchase volume increased 15% driven by higher out-of-partner spend in addition to partner performance and penetration growth. The 10% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume reflected the growth in average active accounts and greater customer engagement. Health &amp; Wellness purchase volume grew 15% compared to last year as we experienced broad-based growth in active accounts as well as higher spend per active account. In Home &amp; Auto, purchase volume increased 9%, generally reflecting strong spend in home and higher prices in furniture.And in Lifestyle, purchase volume was 2% higher, driven by higher out-of-partner spend. Turning to Synchrony's dual and co-branded cards where we continue to experience strong growth. Core purchase volume on these products grew 21% versus last year and represented approximately 40% of our total purchase volume for the quarter. As we discussed in the past, our customers derive great value from our dual and co-branded cards because they combine best-in-class rewards with broad utility. Generally speaking, approximately half of our out-of-partner spend is comprised of nondiscretionary spend by billpay, discount store, drugstore, healthcare, grocery, and auto and gas. And while we observed some minor category shifts during December, for example, from T&amp;E related spend towards more clothing and other retail as well as a reduction in auto and gas-related spend towards more grocery and discount spend, Synchrony's relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary out-of-partner spend has remained essentially unchanged.Consistently strong consumer spend, coupled with some moderation in payment rate contributed to 10% higher average balances per account versus last year and 15% growth in ending receivables. Our dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of core receivables and increased 28% from the prior year. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.1 billion, primarily reflecting a 13% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables and higher loan receivable yields, partially offset by the impacts of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of 2022. On a core basis, interest and fees increased 21%. Payment rate for the fourth quarter, when normalizing for the prior year impact of the portfolios recently sold, was 17%, approximately 75 basis points lower than last year and approximately 160 basis points higher than our five-year historical average.The net interest margin was 15.58% in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 19 basis points. The primary driver of the decrease was higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 168 basis points to 2.86% and reduced net interest margin by 136 basis points. The mix of interest-earning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly 6 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by a 92 basis point improvement in loan yields, which contributed 79 basis points to net interest margin, and our liquidity portfolio yields, which contributed 44 basis points. RSAs were $1 billion in the fourth quarter and 4.68% of average loan receivables. The $224 million year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022 and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.Provision for credit losses were $1.2 billion for the quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the impact of a growth-driven $425 million reserve build and higher net charge-offs. Other income decreased $137 million, primarily reflecting the impacts of the prior year's venture investment gain and the current quarter's higher loyalty costs driven by our strong purchase volume. Other expenses increased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs, technology investments and transaction volume, partially offset by $75 million of asset impairments and certain incremental marketing investments recognized in the prior period. The fourth quarter employee cost included certain additional compensation items of $21 million, higher stock-based compensation and higher headcount driven by growth and in-sourcing.Total other expense included $12 million of additional marketing and growth reinvestment from second quarter's $120 million gain on sale proceeds. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, the $120 million gain on sale and reinvestment made in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year were EPS neutral for the full year 2022. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 37.2% compared to 41.1% last year. Putting it all together, Synchrony generated fourth quarter net earnings of $577 million or $1.26 per diluted shares. We also generated a return on average assets of 2.2% and return on tangible common equity of 22.1%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. The external deposit data we monitor continues to reflect a slow reduction in consumer savings.Average deposit balances at the end of December were down approximately 5% from their peak in March of 2022, but still approximately 1% higher than 2021's average and 12% higher than 2020's average. On an annualized trend basis, the savings decline that began around that March 2022 peak appears to have started to slow in December, primarily in terms of its intensity. Turning to Synchrony's portfolio, credit normalization continued as expected during the fourth quarter. These digits are still performing better than 2018. And delinquency entry rates remain lower than the historical average at approximately 80% of their pre-pandemic levels. That said, as consumer savings rates has decreased, borrower payment behavior is reverting towards pre-pandemic levels with normalizing entry rates into delinquency and higher roll rates in early delinquency stages following the charge-offs.This trend continued in the fourth quarter as payment rate normalization trends expanded from the nonprime segments of our portfolio into the prime and super prime segments, where the average outstanding balances tend to be larger. Relative to period end receivables, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.65% compared to 2.62% last year and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.69% versus 1.17% in the prior year. And our fourth quarter net charge-off rate increased to 3.48% from 2.37% last year, still remaining well below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, at which point portfolio credit risk is better optimized relative to profitability. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.30%, down 28 basis points from the 10.58% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of an asset growth-driven reserve builds, which was more than offset by the impact of receivables growth in the denominator.Moving to another source of Synchrony's strength, our capital, liquidity and funding. Deposits at the end of the fourth quarter reached $71.7 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources decreased by $316 million. Altogether, deposits represented 84% of our funding, while securitized and unsecured debt represented 7% and 9%, respectively, at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $17.2 billion or 16.4% of our total assets, consistent with last year. We maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and our secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least 80% deposits. We expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth, and we'll maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding.We manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral. That said, as we continue to grow our deposit base, and given the level of interest rates, consumers are actively rotating from savings to CDs. This has had the effect of extending our deposit duration while making our balance sheet slightly liability sensitive. We will continue to manage interest rate risk through term maturities. It's also important to note through its mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level, Synchrony's RSA will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business. Moving on to discuss Synchrony's capital position. Note that we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies.As a result, starting this past January of 2022, and continuing in January of 2023, Synchrony makes an annual transition adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. It should also be noted that the FASB CECL update for the accounting of TDRs becomes effective for Synchrony as of January 2023. This accounting standard update eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, which previously followed a separate process using a discounted cash flow methodology to quantify the TDR-specific reserve requirement. Synchrony is adopting this update on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2023.Based on our current estimate, the adoption will result in approximately $300 million reduction to our reserve balance, which we recognize net of tax and equity. The netted impact of the adoption will contribute approximately 25 basis point increase to our capital ratios. From a capital metric perspective, we ended the quarter at 12.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 280 basis points lower than last year's level of 15.6%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.6% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.5% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 280 basis points to 15%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.4% compared to 24.4% last year. Synchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns in the fourth quarter.Photo by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashIn total, we returned $803 million to shareholders through $700 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $700 million. Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. As we make further progress toward our targeted capital levels, we look to develop our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock and the issuance of subordinated debt. Finally, let's turn to our 2023 outlook for the full year, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation.We expect strong consumer demand for the wide variety of products and services we finance to support continued broad-based purchase volume growth. As excess consumer savings continue to decline, year-over-year purchase volume growth rate should slow. Payment rates should also continue to moderate but we're still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels throughout 2023. Together, these dynamics should contribute to ending receivables growth between 8% and 10%. We expect our net interest margin to be between 15% and 15.25% for the full year and follow typical seasonal trends. This outlook is based on a peak Fed funds rate of 5.25% and incorporates the following five impacts during 2023. One, the increase in interest-bearing liabilities cost due to higher benchmark rates and the potential competitive pressures or higher retail deposit betas to address funding needs; two, higher interest and fee yields, partially offset by higher income reversals as delinquency and charge-offs continue to normalize; three, an increase in our liquidity portfolio yields, primarily reflecting the higher benchmark rates; four, the fluctuation of mix of average loan receivables relative to average interest-earning assets as driven by the seasonal growth trends and timing of our funding; and five, the full year impact of the portfolios sold during second quarter 2022.Before we turn to our credit outlook, it's important to note there are a number of uncertainties that could change our expectations and the trajectory of credit normalization. We have greater visibility for the first half of this year and any significant changes in the medium-term macroeconomic backdrop would more likely impact portfolio credit trends in 2024. With regard to our portfolio's credit trajectory in 2023, we expect most of the portfolio delinquency metrics to have reached normalized levels or equivalent to pre-pandemic levels by midyear. Accordingly, the associated charge-offs will reach pre-pandemic levels approximately six months later. The seasonal impact of tax refunds and bonuses in the first half, and the third quarter's acceleration of receivables growth will likely lead to a decline in net charge-off rate for Q3 before credit losses rise and continue the normalization path through the fourth quarter.Given our expectation that delinquency metrics will reach their pre-pandemic levels by midyear, we expect net charge-offs to be between 4.75% to 5% for the full year, still considerably below our pre-pandemic annual loss rate target of 5.5% to 6%. We run multiple economic scenarios to inform our credit outlook as part of our normal business process. Our baseline reserve assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 4.2% by year-end. We have qualitative overlays for the current uncertainty and possibility of a mild recession. In this scenario, we'd expect the unemployment level closer to 5%. This is reflected in our fourth quarter 2022 reserve rate, which is still higher than our day 1 CECL rate. Barring any significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we do not expect our portfolio to reflect our fully normalized annual loss rate target until 2024.Accordingly, we continue to expect reserve builds in 2023 to be generally asset-driven and that the reserve rate will gradually migrate towards approximately 10% as credit normalization brings our portfolio net charge-offs back to that mean annual loss rate to which we've been underwriting. RSA expense will continue to serve as a functional alignment of economic interest with our partners, reflecting the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth, offset by rising net charge-offs. As a result, we expect RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to be between 4% and 4.25%. Should credit normalize at a slower rate than we expect, RSAs will likely come closer into the high end of that range. And the extent that funding costs or net charge-off rise to the high end or beyond of our current assumptions, we expect the RSA to come in to the low end or lower than this range.In terms of other expense, we remain committed to delivering operating leverage, such that expenses grow at a slower rate than net interest income. Our full year expectation that expenses will run approximately $1.125 billion per quarter to the extent that receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year will moderate our spending where appropriate while still prioritizing the best long-term prospects for our business. As we demonstrated throughout this past year, Synchrony's business and financial models are performing as it's designed to do. Our proprietary data and analytics, diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack allow us to reach and improve more customers for the same level of risk while leveraging low customer acquisition costs and driving greater customer lifetime value.Our retailer share ranges are effectively aligning our partners' economic interest with our own, and in doing so, enabling Synchrony to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions.

In short, Synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient risk-adjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and partners evolve. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial operating targets as market conditions stabilize. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.Brian Doubles : Thanks, Brian. Looking to 2023 and beyond, Synchrony is well positioned to navigate the uncertainties of the operating environment that lies ahead.

Yet, these types of ""boring"" stocks might actually be what you need right now.See the List: GOBankingRates' Best Banks of 2023Important: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Learn: How 2023 Recession Will Differ From 2008 and How You Should Prepare DifferentlyAt the end of the day, the stock market is not a ""get-rich-quick"" scheme. Many of the same meme stocks that shot up overnight have also turned those gains into huge losses. For many investors, reliable, old-fashioned companies with consistent earnings and dividends are just the ticket for long-term gains, even if they're not the type to jump 50% or more in a single day.As with any investment, be sure to consult with your financial advisor and discuss your investment objectives and risk tolerance before you make any moves. Here's a look at some ""boring"" stocks that may put long-term dollars into your pocket.josefkubes / Shutterstock.com3M (MMM)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $120.65When it comes to so-called ""boring"" stocks, 3M has to be near the top of the list. The venerable maker of such household products as Scotch Tape and Post-It Notes certainly doesn't have the headline-making power of, say, electric vehicle maker Tesla or iPhone maker Apple. Yet, 3M has been a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1976, it has paid dividends to shareholders without interruption for more than 100 years, and it has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years. Currently, the stock's yield sits at an extraordinary 5.03%. Put it all together, and as boring as 3M may seem, stock credentials don't get much more blue-chip than that.Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsKen Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (PSA)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $289.10Public Storage is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the world. This certainly doesn't sound like an exciting business. However, it's a great ""boring"" stock to own due to its consistency. Americans are nothing if not excellent consumers, and in many cases, all of that ""stuff"" becomes too much to store at home. The storage business is a resilient one and can thrive in nearly any type of economy. In recessions, people downsize and need a place to store their things, and in a booming economy, spending picks up and adds to the ""storage of stuff"" problem. Thus, analysts consider this type of business recession-resistant. Currently, the stock is paying an attractive 2.7% yield.Story continuesastudio / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (CAT)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $249.71Caterpillar is another staid member of the old-fashioned Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining 30 years ago in 1991. The average consumer may know that Caterpillar makes machinery like bulldozers, but the company is much more than that. In fact, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel-electric locomotives, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines, to the tune of a whopping $51 billion in revenues in 2021 alone, up 22% over 2020. With a solid dividend yield of 1.95% and a product line that should benefit from a global economic recovery, Caterpillar could be a ""boring"" stock to watch for the long run.ShutterstockAmerican Water Works (AWK)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $151.54When it comes to ""boring"" stocks, utilities are usually at the top of the list. Utilities provide the basic services that all Americans need, such as water and power, and they often aren't popular with consumers, as they issue bills every single month with charges that seem to consistently rise. From an investor's perspective, however, this is what makes utilities attractive to invest in. By providing services that all people need, utilities generate a predictable, consistent revenue stream. This may sound boring, but it puts money directly into investors' pockets.American Water Works is the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility company in America. The need for clean water will always be there, and in the event of water shortages, prices will go up, which benefits investors. The stock has been a long-term, consistent winner and it currently pays a dividend yield of 1.74%.Supannee_Hickman / Shutterstock.comChevron (CVX)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $180.90Unlike most stocks on this list, Chevron actually had two boom years in 2021 and 2022, rising 38.96% and 52.95%, respectively. These are big gains for a company that's traditionally valued for its stability and the size of its large dividend. However, analysts still have a consensus ""buy"" rating on the stock, and if you're looking for consistent income, Chevron's a good choice. Even with the rise of electric vehicles, demand for oil remains huge, and the company's cash flow sustains a hefty 3.17% current dividend, making Chevron a great source of equity income.Bonsales / Shutterstock.comDisney (DIS)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $103.48The Walt Disney Company may make a more exciting product to most people than companies like 3M or Caterpillar, but it's still considered a reliable, ""boring"" stock. Disney could be a stock to take a look at because it is on the cusp of some big changes - and it has also struggled mightily through the pandemic. In Nov. 2022, the Disney board of directors booted pandemic-era CEO Bob Chapek and restored his famed predecessor Bob Iger, who ran the company solidly for 15 years. With the stock down about 44% in 2022 alone, this may be a good time for long-term investors to take another look at one of the most beloved ""boring"" companies on Wall Street. Under Iger's leadership, shareholders will no doubt be looking for recoveries across all of Disney's popular consumer segments, from feature films and streaming to theme parks and cruise ships.ShutterstockNRG Energy (NRG)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $32.21NRG Energy is another utility, like American Water Works, that may sound boring but that could be a good choice for your portfolio. With a current yield at a whopping 4.51%, NRG Energy puts a lot of money in investors' pockets every year. But the power industry's leading company has a lot more going for it looking forward than looking back. Under the Biden administration, more federal money is being allocated to clean energy generation. NRG Energy may benefit from this global push, as the company has three renewable energy plants and is looking to take advantage of this fast-growing area. Even if the Democrats lose power in Washington in coming years, the move towards renewables looks set to continue on a global basis.rvolkan / iStock.comMicrosoft (MSFT)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $240.22Microsoft is another of a large gang of ""old tech"" stocks that in many circles just aren't as exciting anymore, with a new wave of companies like Salesforce.com, Shopify and Square gobbling both headlines and investor interest. Yet, Microsoft is much more than the ""boring"" old tech stock that only sells Windows software. Microsoft has been moving aggressively into cloud services in recent years, and its earnings are starting to reflect a much higher growth profile, including its venture software for electric vehicles. The company's CEO has recently announced some small layoffs and cautioned investors about a bumpy road for tech companies, but these announcements - and the vicious bear market of 2022 - have only served to give long-term investors an entry point on this long-term, ""boring"" winner. After dropping about 29% in 2022, the stock now yields 1.17%, not bad for a growth-oriented tech stock.ivanastar / Getty ImagesLowe's (LOW)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $204.53Lowe's is one of the two companies that dominate the home improvement space, along with Home Depot. Unless you're a contractor, there's nothing really exciting about a company that sells lights, screws, flooring, tools and construction supplies. However, the stock has been exciting indeed for investors, gaining about 95% over the past five years - and dropping ""only"" about 15% in 2022, in the midst of a significant bear market.Lowe's did well during the heart of the pandemic, posting a return of over 98% in 2020 alone as people stayed home and took on renovation projects. However, the long-term prospects of the company are good as well, as foot traffic continues to rise, and its installation services are generating additional revenue. Lowe's certainly has highs and lows as the housing market expands and contracts, but over the long-run, Americans enjoy being homeowners, and there will always be projects to work on. Lowe's also supports a current yield of 2.08%, offering a decent level of income on top of its growth potential.varandah / Shutterstock.comMastercard (MA)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $376.28The business of credit card processing may not seem all that exciting. But it sure can be profitable. With about 83% of Americans owning at least one credit card, a company like Mastercard has an entrenched customer base that is likely to continue spending. While short-term blips like the pandemic or a recession can temporarily slow consumer spending, history has shown that it always picks up and reaches new highs. Every time a customer swipes a Mastercard to pay for these purchases, Mastercard generates revenue. This makes Mastercard the poster child for ""boring"" stocks that can be important to own for your long-term portfolio. Even in 2022, during the midst of a fierce bear market, shares of Mastercard only fell just over 3%.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsDisclaimer: This list of stocks to consider was originally compiled on and is accurate as of January 20, 2023.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Boring Stocks That Are Important for Your Portfolio]"

The company’s earnings outlook has come under pressure, landing QCOM into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike STX, Qualcomm rewards its shareholders via an annual dividend yielding 2.3%, above the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd the company has managed to fare well in its quarterly prints, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in seven consecutive quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdvanced Micro DevicesAdvanced Micro Devices offers a broad portfolio of high-performance and adaptive processor technologies, combining CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, Adaptive SoCs, and deep software expertise to enable leadership computing platforms for cloud, edge, and end devices.Currently, AMD is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the company’s upcoming quarterly release on January 31st, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.67 suggests a roughly 25% year-over-year decline.AMD’s top line looks to improve, with our $5.5 billion consensus quarterly revenue estimate suggesting a change of 14% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, AMD’s valuation multiples have pulled back but remain on the higher end of the spectrum; the company’s shares trade at a 27.6X forward earnings multiple, a fraction of the 49.9X five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFollowing a challenging 2022, semiconductor stocks have gotten off to a much better start in 2023, undoubtedly a welcomed development among investors.And all three above – Qualcomm QCOM, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, and Seagate Technologies STX – have recently received upgrades from Barclays, perhaps indicating that the tide could be turning.Still, we want positive earnings estimate revisions to start rolling in, which would help further confirm that the outlook is shifting favorably.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But as we have entered 2023, a very early sign of a rebound is visible on Wall Street, with peak inflation seemingly behind us. As proof of this, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — has crept above 4K for the first time in several weeks.In particular, the market participants see a pending 25 basis-point interest rate hike next week as a sign of slowing Fed tightening, providing a much-needed respite to the economy. Yet, despite the central bank’s softening stance, traders and investors continue to see headwinds in the form of softness in consumer spending, worries over a tight labor market and disappointing fourth-quarter 2022 earnings numbers. As such, extremely volatile trading in U.S. markets is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Here are the three stocks that made it through the screen:Clarivate Plc CLVT: The company provides information and analytic products worldwide, including scientific, patient and academic research to the top pharmaceutical firms. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this London-based firm indicates 12.5% year-over-year earnings per share growth. CLVT has a VGM Score of B.Clarivate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 9.4%, on average. CLVT shares have lost 33.6% in a year.Expedia Group EXPE: One of the largest online travel companies in the world, Expedia Group’s web portals focus on travel planning, travel purchases and travel experience sharing. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Seattle, WA-based company indicates 350.9% year-over-year earnings per share growth. EXPE has a VGM Score of A.Expedia Group beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. Over the past 90 days, the company saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 move up 4.8%. EXPE stock has lost 32.5% in a year.Haemonetics Corporation HAE: The company provides blood management solutions to customers encompassing blood and plasma collectors, hospitals and health care providers globally. The fiscal 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Boston, MA-based firm indicates 11.2% year-over-year earnings per share growth. HAE has a VGM Score of A.Haemonetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 12.1%, on average.

Yesterday, we received quarterly prints from Baker Hughes BKR and Logitech International LOGI, among others.And coming up soon is Northrop Grumman NOC, expected to reveal its quarterly results on Thursday, January 26th, before the market open.Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), including electronic systems, information technology, aircraft, space technology, and systems integration services.NOC shares have outperformed over the last year, up 15% compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHow does the company shape up heading into its quarterly release? Fortunately, we can use Lockheed-Martin’s LMT quarterly results received just this morning as a small gauge.Lockheed Martin Q4Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, serving in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, cyber security, and information technology.Lockheed Martin delivered better-than-expected results, reporting quarterly earnings of $7.79 per share, beating the $7.41 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 5% and growing 7.5% Y/Y.Further, the company generated roughly $19 billion in sales throughout the quarter, again topping our consensus estimate of $18.3 billion by 4%, climbing 7.3% Y/Y.Impressively, the company’s backlog grew 11% Y/Y to $150 billion while returning $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Still, the company’s cash-generating abilities took a hit; LMT generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, decreasing 67% Y/Y. And cash from operations totaled $1.9 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.CEO James Taiclet, on the results, “Lockheed Martin’s stronger than expected finish to the year demonstrated the company’s reliability and resiliency to meet commitments in challenging environments, while leading the industry’s critical security advancements for our nation and allies.”Story continuesNorthrop GrummanQuarterly Estimates –Analysts have had mixed opinions for the quarter to be reported, with a singular downward and upward earnings estimate revision hitting the tape over the last several months.

178,83c10356-db8e-3eef-ae34-bef1f41ebc66,PHM,2023-01-25,PulteGroup (PHM) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-earnings-expected-grow-150003367.html,1674572403,STORY,['PHM'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when PulteGroup (PHM) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.6 billion, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.81% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PulteGroup?For PulteGroup, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PulteGroup will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PulteGroup would post earnings of $2.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.69, delivering a surprise of -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PulteGroup doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. On December 30, the stock market finished its worst year since 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 73.55 points, or 0.22%, finishing at 33,147.25. The S&amp;P 500 dropped by 0.25% and closed at 3,839.50. The NASDAQ Composite went down by 0.11% and closed at 10,466.88. All three of the primary indices experienced their worst year since 2008 and broke a three-year period of gains. In 2022, the Dow performed the best among the indexes, declining approximately 8.8%. The S&amp;P 500 dropped by 19.4% and was over 20% below its all-time high. The NASDAQ, which is heavily focused on technology, fell by 33.1%.Heading into 2023, some investors believe that the downturn is not yet over. They anticipate that the bear market will continue until an economic recession occurs or the Federal Reserve changes its approach. Additionally, some predict that stocks will reach new lows before recovering in the latter half of 2023. Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, said on CNBC’s “The Exchange” on December 30:“I would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‘Wizard of Oz’ and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that.”The NASDAQ-100 index includes the 100 largest technology companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 2022, it performed poorly, falling by 33% as investors reduced their investments in the high-growth technology sector. However, based on the historical annual returns of the NASDAQ-100 dating back to 1986, having consecutive years of decline is very uncommon. In fact, the index has only declined for two consecutive years on one occasion, during the dot-com crash between 2000 and 2002. Despite the current challenges such as high inflation and rising interest rates, based on past history, there is a possibility that the NASDAQ could experience a strong year in 2023. Story continuesA lot of NASDAQ stocks currently present attractive buying opportunities as they are trading on discounts.

The FLNGs, positioned near offshore gas production wells, efficiently liquefy natural gas on-site using cold seawater, avoiding the need for pipelines linked to on-shore liquefaction facilities. The FSRU stores LNG and has onboard facilities that convert LNG back into its gaseous state.

(NASDAQ:EWBC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We purchased East West Bancorp in the third quarter of 2017; however, our history with the business stretches back further having twice previously invested. Companies we consider to be high-quality like East West tend to remain high quality, and we have long admired the business for its uniqueness among the otherwise homogeneous U.S. banking industry. Its dominant market share built over generations in Asian communities – and difficult-to-replicate experience due to culture, geography and business practices – create distinct competitive advantages in our view. During our most recent holding period, the bank achieved sustained loan growth, a catalyst we identified, through its continued leadership position as the financial “bridge” for customers doing business in the U.S. and China. Moreover, East West also realized market share gains in its headquarters state of California. With these catalysts nearing completion, we decided to exit our investment to fund the purchase of Oshkosh. As always, we will continue to study East West and, in the future, may once again find an opportunity to be investors.”10. Avis Budget Group, Inc.

Dish Network continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS’s cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish’s long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration’s infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.”6.

Merck is discontinuing the study based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee which reviewed data from a planned interim analysis. At the interim analysis, KEYTRUDA in combination with enzalutamide and ADT did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival (OS) or radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), the trial’s dual primary endpoints, compared to placebo plus enzalutamide and ADT. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. No new safety signals were identified; however, the combination was associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3-5 adverse events and serious adverse events compared to the control arm. Merck is informing study investigators of the decision and advises patients in the study to speak to their physician regarding treatment. Data from this study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.""There is a significant unmet need for patients with advanced prostate cancer, and the outcome of this study is an important reminder that this disease remains very difficult to treat,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study, and we will continue to advance our clinical development program to evaluate KEYTRUDA-based combinations and novel candidates for patients with prostate cancer.""Merck has a strong commitment to the development of new treatment options for patients with prostate cancer. Merck’s clinical development program is evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in the Phase 2 trials KEYNOTE-199 and KEYNOTE-365 and the Phase 3 registrational trial KEYNOTE-641. Additionally, in July 2022, Merck entered into a global development and commercialization agreement with Orion Corporation for Orion’s investigational candidate ODM-208 (MK-5684), which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Story continuesAbout KEYNOTE-991KEYNOTE-991 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04191096) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo in combination with enzalutamide plus ADT in patients with mHSPC. The primary endpoints are OS and rPFS per Prostate Cancer Working Group-modified RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 1,251 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks for up to two years) plus enzalutamide (160 mg daily) and ADT (at a dose and frequency of administration that is consistent with the local product label), or placebo plus enzalutamide and ADT.About metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate, with approximately 375,300 people estimated to have died from the disease in 2020. Up to one-third of patients with prostate cancer will develop metastatic disease, where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, and face a five-year survival rate of only 30%. The development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mHSPC, the cancer can be treated with hormone therapy, also known as ADT, which blocks or stops androgens to slow cancer growth. Despite high initial response rates with ADT alone, the majority of patients progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer within three years and no longer respond to hormone therapy.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism.

Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

189,c2c2bd3f-acaf-3604-971a-9f84738af509,MRK,2023-01-25,Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Plus Chemotherapy Significantly Improved Overall Survival Versus Chemotherapy in First-Line Advanced or Unresectable Biliary Tract Cancer in KEYNOTE-966 Trial,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-keytruda-pembrolizumab-plus-chemotherapy-114500666.html,1674647100,STORY,['MRK'],"[RAHWAY, N.J., January 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced positive results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-966 trial. In the final analysis of this trial, KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer (BTC). The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and will be submitted to regulatory authorities.""Biliary tract cancer is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, and these patients face a poor prognosis, with five-year survival rates estimated to be approximately 5% to 15%,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are very encouraged by these overall survival results that show the potential benefit of KEYTRUDA in addition to chemotherapy for biliary cancer patients who are in urgent need of new treatment options.""Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers and is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in gastric, hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.About KEYNOTE-966KEYNOTE-966 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04003636) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced and/or unresectable BTC. The primary endpoint was OS, and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, objective response rate, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 1,069 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately two years) plus gemcitabine and cisplatin, or placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin.Story continuesAbout Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC)Biliary tract cancer is a group of rare and highly aggressive cancers in the gallbladder and bile ducts. Biliary tract cancer is the second most common type of primary liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma, accounting for 15% of all liver cancers. It is estimated there are approximately 211,000 new cases of BTC diagnosed and 174,000 deaths from the disease each year globally. Biliary tract cancer is most frequently diagnosed in patients between 50 to 70 years old, and 70% of BTC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Patients diagnosed with BTC face a very poor prognosis, as the five-year survival rate is estimated to be between 5% and 15%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis.

This week is the first big one of this reporting cycle. The season will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five large-cap companies are set to beat Q4 2022 earnings results next week. These are Nucor Corp. NUE, American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, SAP SE SAP and Rockwell Automation Inc. ROK.Q4 2022 Earnings Results So FarAs of Jan 20, 55 S&amp;P 500 companies reported their earnings results. Total earnings of these companies are down 10.8% year over year on 7.4% higher revenues with 67.3% beating EPS estimates and 67.3% beating revenue estimates. Our current projection shows that for fourth-quarter 2022, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index as a whole are expected to decline 7.4% year over year on 4% higher revenues.Our Top PicksFive large-cap companies are set to beat earnings estimates this week. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and 3 (Hold) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The chart below shows the price performance of five above-mentioned stocks in the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor is committed to expanding its production capabilities and growing its business through strategic acquisitions. NUE has already commissioned some of its growth projects. These should drive growth and strengthen Nucor’s position as a low-cost producer.Story continuesNUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market. NUE remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive Nucor’s margins.Zacks Rank #2 Nucor has an Earnings ESP of +3.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.5% over the last 30 days. NUE recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.9%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.American Airlines Group has benefitted from improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front. Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13% higher than the level recorded in fourth-quarter 2019.AAL’s debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025. AAL’s codeshare agreement with Indian low-cost airline, IndiGo, is an added positive.Zacks Rank #2 American Airlines Group has an Earnings ESP of +9.79%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 17.7% over the last 30 days.AAL recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 8.6%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.International Business Machines is likely to witness growth driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. Synergies from the Red Hat buyout are boosting the competitive position of IBM in the hybrid cloud market.International Business Machines is likely to benefit from the robust adoption and broad-based availability of IBM Blockchain World Wire — a blockchain-driven global payments network aimed at accelerating and optimizing cross-border payments. IBM is also poised to gain from the spin-off of the legacy infrastructure services business as it focuses on the hybrid cloud strategy.Zacks Rank #3 International Business Machines has an Earnings ESP of +1.90%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.3% for the current year. IBM recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 1.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 25, after the closing bell.SAP’s performance is gaining from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Synergies from recent acquisitions bode well. Frequent product launches like SAP Build augur well.Momentum in SAP’s Business Process Intelligence platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions along with healthy traction witnessed in SuccessFactors Employee Central, Ariba and Fieldglass, Qualtrics and other cloud-based offerings is noteworthy.Zacks Rank #2 SAP has an Earnings ESP of +3.09%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 20.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 20.2% over the last 30 days. SAP is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.Rockwell Automation reported record order levels of more than $10 billion in fiscal 2022, indicating solid underlying demand from customers across many industries and regions. ROK expects total sales growth of 7.5% to 11.5% for fiscal 2023.Organic sales growth is projected at 9-13% for the fiscal with the CUBIC acquisition adding 1%. Huge capital investments across many end markets coupled with higher automation and digital transformation will continue to support ROK’s solid order levels.Zacks Rank #3 ROK has an Earnings ESP of +4.76%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.5% for the current year (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.

Without a waiver, the planemaker had said the MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes were at risk.Calhoun said he thinks the MAX 7 will have its first flights this year and the MAX 10 ""probably"" next year.Congress said Boeing must retrofit existing MAX airplanes with safety enhancements as part of that waiver. West said the provision to account for retrofits costs was ""small.""(Reporting by Valerie Insinna and David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler, Louise Heavens and Nick Zieminski)]"

One of the best ways to do that is by looking at its history — in particular, the last five years. Five years is a good length of time in which to measure a stock’s overall performance because the markets have had both bull and bear runs within that time frame.Take a look at one of the leading residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) and see how much you would be making in dividends today if you invested $10,000 in its shares five years ago:Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is a Germantown, Tennessee-based residential REIT that specializes in owning and leasing apartment complexes. It owns over 100,000 units in 282 communities across 16 states and Washington, D.C. Most of Mid-America Apartment Communities’ properties are located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic states.Mid-America Apartment Communities has a capitalization of $18.2 billion. The 52-week closing range is $141.13 to $217.64, with the low coming in mid-October, 2022. Since then, it has risen about 10%, and its most recent closing price was $155.28.If you had invested $10,000 in Mid-America Apartment Communities in January 2018, you would have received 107.23 shares at a price of $93.25. At the time, the quarterly dividend paid $0.923 per share.Over the five-year period, Mid-America Apartment Communities has performed quite well. Its dividend has increased by 51% to $1.40 per share. The last dividend increase was by 12% this month, from $1.25 to $1.40 per share. Mid-America Apartment Communities also raised its dividend by almost 15% in May 2022, so it was somewhat surprising to see another hefty dividend increase this month. These were two of the largest dividend increases in Mid-America Apartment Communities’ history.The total return on your five-year investment would have been $62.03 in appreciation and $20.79 in dividends for a total return of $82.82 per share, or 88.81%. Your starting investment of $10,000 would be worth $18,880.58 today.Story continuesIf you chose to reinvest the dividends, your original 107.23 shares would have grown to 125.42 shares for a total return of 94.72%. The original $10,000 investment would now be worth $19,469.Mid-America Apartment Communities has a record of 115 consecutive dividend payments. It has never cut its dividend over the past five years, even during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.Mid-America Apartment Communities has forward funds from operations (FFO) of $8.41 and pays a $5.60 annual dividend, for a fairly safe payout ratio of 66.5%. The present dividend yield is 3.6%.The irony of 2022, a year in which Mid-America Apartment Communities had a total return of negative 28.51%, is that it actually was growing its revenue and FFO because of the influx of tenants that moved from northern areas of the U.S. to the Sun Belt. Third-quarter revenue was 15% ahead of the third quarter of 2021, and FFO of $2.19 was $0.34 higher than the third quarter of 2021. That would suggest that, at its present price and given its generous dividend increases, Mid-America Apartment Communities could have plenty of upside in 2023.Check Out More on Real Estate from BenzingaBezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Analysts Are Bullish On Industrial Real Estate: Here Are 2 Private Market Offerings To Gain ExposureThis Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This compares to earnings of $1.76 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electronics maker would post earnings of $1.87 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.88, delivering a surprise of 0.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.TE Connectivity , which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry, posted revenues of $3.84 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.27%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.TE Connectivity shares have added about 8.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for TE Connectivity?While TE Connectivity has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for TE Connectivity: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.60 on $3.92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.79 on $15.9 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Miscellaneous Components is currently in the bottom 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, OSI Systems (OSIS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on January 26.This airport security and full-body scanner manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.2%.

These non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our company. We believe these measures provide meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance the understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash, and the trends of our business. Additionally, we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operations. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The following provides additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures:Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) – represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin – represent operating income and operating margin, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize these adjusted measures in combination with operating income and operating margin to assess segment level operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and market conditions. Adjusted Operating Income is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Adjusted Other Income (Expense), Net – represents net other income (expense) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other items, if any.Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate – represent income tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any.Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations – represents income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects.Adjusted Earnings Per Share – represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.Free Cash Flow (FCF) – is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP financial measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and cash paid (collected) pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross-currency swap contracts, are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. In the calculation of Free Cash Flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP financial measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Examples of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the extent, severity and duration of COVID-19 negatively affecting our business operations; business, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, such as conditions affecting demand for products in the automotive and other industries we serve; competition and pricing pressure; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices; natural disasters and political, economic and military instability in countries in which we operate, including continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; developments in the credit markets; future goodwill impairment; compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations; and the possible effects on us of changes in tax laws, tax treaties and other legislation, including the effects of Swiss tax reform. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include the geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, the impact on our suppliers' and customers' supply chains, the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate, and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate.  More detailed information about these and other factors is set forth in TE Connectivity Ltd.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Sept 30, 2022, as well as in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other reports filed by us with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)For the Quarters EndedDecember 30,December 24,20222021(in millions, except per share data)Net sales$3,841$3,818Cost of sales 2,6542,588Gross margin1,1871,230Selling, general, and administrative expenses392363Research, development, and engineering expenses173175Acquisition and integration costs98Restructuring and other charges, net11112Operating income502672Interest income92Interest expense(21)(12)Other income (expense), net(5)15Income from continuing operations before income taxes 485677Income tax expense(87)(110)Income from continuing operations398567Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(1)(1)Net income$397$566Basic earnings per share:Income from continuing operations$1.26$1.73Income from discontinued operations——Net income1.251.73Diluted earnings per share:Income from continuing operations$1.25$1.72Income from discontinued operations——Net income1.241.72Weighted-average number of shares outstanding: Basic317327Diluted319330 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)December 30,September 30,20222022(in millions, except share data)AssetsCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$793$1,088Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $452,9102,865Inventories2,9272,676Prepaid expenses and other current assets688639Total current assets7,3187,268Property, plant, and equipment, net3,7813,567Goodwill5,5115,258Intangible assets, net1,3571,288Deferred income taxes2,5912,498Other assets795903Total assets$21,353$20,782Liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and shareholders' equityCurrent liabilities:Short-term debt$820$914Accounts payable1,7511,593Accrued and other current liabilities1,8492,125Total current liabilities4,4204,632Long-term debt3,3983,292Long-term pension and postretirement liabilities728695Deferred income taxes228244Income taxes319304Other liabilities792718Total liabilities9,8859,885Commitments and contingenciesRedeemable noncontrolling interests10495Shareholders' equity:Common shares, CHF 0.57 par value, 330,830,781 shares authorized and issued146146Accumulated earnings 13,20012,832Treasury shares, at cost, 14,065,031 and 12,749,540 shares, respectively(1,854)(1,681)Accumulated other comprehensive loss(128)(495)Total shareholders' equity11,36410,802Total liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and shareholders' equity$21,353$20,782 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)For the Quarters EndedDecember 30,December 24,20222021(in millions)Cash flows from operating activities:Net income$397$566Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes11Income from continuing operations398567Adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities:Depreciation and amortization187198Deferred income taxes(35)4Non-cash lease cost3431Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventories5133Share-based compensation expense3232Other 49(9)Changes in assets and liabilities, net of the effects of acquisitions and divestitures:Accounts receivable, net(54)148Inventories(324)(264)Prepaid expenses and other current assets(86)52Accounts payable14915Accrued and other current liabilities(39)(285)Income taxes2534Other194(24)Net cash provided by operating activities581532Cash flows from investing activities:Capital expenditures(183)(172)Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment154Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired(109)(100)Proceeds from divestiture of businesses, net of cash retained by businesses sold—16Other263Net cash used in investing activities(265)(199)Cash flows from financing activities:Net increase (decrease) in commercial paper(139)479Repayment of debt(4)(555)Proceeds from exercise of share options1122Repurchase of common shares(287)(304)Payment of common share dividends to shareholders(178)(163)Other(24)(31)Net cash used in financing activities(621)(552)Effect of currency translation on cash10(2)Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(295)(221)]"

Yesterday, we received quarterly prints from Baker Hughes BKR and Logitech International LOGI, among others.And coming up soon is Northrop Grumman NOC, expected to reveal its quarterly results on Thursday, January 26th, before the market open.Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), including electronic systems, information technology, aircraft, space technology, and systems integration services.NOC shares have outperformed over the last year, up 15% compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHow does the company shape up heading into its quarterly release? Fortunately, we can use Lockheed-Martin’s LMT quarterly results received just this morning as a small gauge.Lockheed Martin Q4Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, serving in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, cyber security, and information technology.Lockheed Martin delivered better-than-expected results, reporting quarterly earnings of $7.79 per share, beating the $7.41 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 5% and growing 7.5% Y/Y.Further, the company generated roughly $19 billion in sales throughout the quarter, again topping our consensus estimate of $18.3 billion by 4%, climbing 7.3% Y/Y.Impressively, the company’s backlog grew 11% Y/Y to $150 billion while returning $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Still, the company’s cash-generating abilities took a hit; LMT generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, decreasing 67% Y/Y. And cash from operations totaled $1.9 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.CEO James Taiclet, on the results, “Lockheed Martin’s stronger than expected finish to the year demonstrated the company’s reliability and resiliency to meet commitments in challenging environments, while leading the industry’s critical security advancements for our nation and allies.”Story continuesNorthrop GrummanQuarterly Estimates –Analysts have had mixed opinions for the quarter to be reported, with a singular downward and upward earnings estimate revision hitting the tape over the last several months. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $6.60 suggests an improvement of 10% Y/Y.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, our consensus revenue estimate presently stands at $9.7 billion, indicating a positive change of nearly 12% year-over-year.Valuation –NOC’s valuation levels are elevated on a historical basis; the company’s forward earnings multiple currently sits at 20.8X, above the 15.8X five-year median by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company’s forward price-to-sales works out to be 1.8X, again above the 1.6X five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly Performance –The company snapped a streak of positive surprises in its latest report, falling short of earnings estimates by roughly 3.3%.Top-line results have come in under expectations, with the defense titan falling short of revenue estimates in five consecutive quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPutting Everything TogetherEarnings season continues to chug along, with investors finally seeing what’s transpired behind the scenes.On Thursday, January 26th, we’ll receive quarterly results from a titan in defense, Northrop Grumman NOC.We have already received results from Lockheed Martin LMT, with the company beating on both the top and bottom lines.Analysts have had mixed reactions regarding NOC’s quarter, with estimates indicating an uptick in earnings and revenue.NOC’s valuation multiples could be interpreted as a bit stretched, with its forward earnings multiple and forward price-to-sales ratio residing above their respective five-year medians.In addition, Northrop snapped a streak of positive EPS surprises in its latest release, and the company has struggled to beat revenue estimates.Heading into the release, Northrop Grumman is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP of 0.12%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The inflation rate was at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate to its highest level in 15 years and its strict monetary tightening raised the risk-free market interest rate to a two-decade high. A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth sectors like consumer discretionary.However, as we have entered 2023, consumer discretionary has shown an initial sign of revival. Month to date, of the 11 broad sectors of the market’s benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) has gained 9.3%, second only to the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) that has rallied 12.6%.At this stage, investment in consumer discretionary stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should become fruitful. Five such stocks are - Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL and NIKE Inc. NKE.     Consumer Discretionary Sector to Revive in 2023The consumer discretionary sector is set to revive its fortune this year. Here are the reasons:(1) Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.(2) The Fed raised  the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% in 2022 to the range of 4.25-4.5%. Market is currently expecting the central  bank to increase the interest rate by maximum 75 basis points in 2023. Some financial analysts are expecting the first rate cut to come in the last quarter of 2023 or in early 2024.(3) Headwinds of the pandemic are also behind us. China is gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Story continues(4) The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In that same time, the Consumer Discretionary sector gained 13.63%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%.Investors will be hoping for strength from V.F. as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 7, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1, down 25.93% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.48 billion, down 3.94% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.10 per share and revenue of $11.57 billion, which would represent changes of -33.96% and -2.31%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for V.F.These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. V.F. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).Looking at its valuation, V.F. is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 14.54. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.77.Story continuesWe can also see that VFC currently has a PEG ratio of 4.59. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. VFC's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.59 as of yesterday's close.The Textile - Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations.James Abbott: Hey. Thank you, Joe, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2022 fourth quarter and full year earnings. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck on slide 2, dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of non-GAAP measures, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the earnings release as well as the slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. For our agenda today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons, will provide opening remarks, followed by a brief review of our financial results by Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer.With us also today are Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Keith Maio, Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. During the Q&amp;A session, we anticipate holding that to about 45 minutes in time. And we expect -- we'd ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up related question. With that I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.Harris Simmons: Thanks very much, James. And we welcome all of you to our call this evening. Beginning on slide 3, you'll see some themes that are particularly applicable to Zions in recent quarters as well as some that are likely to be prominent over the near-term horizon. First, our balance sheet, which is supported by what we think is a very high quality deposit base has benefited from rising rates, resulting in growth of net interest income, exclusive of the contribution from PPP loans of more than 40% over the year-ago quarter, and 30%, when including PPP income that had a substantial positive impact a year ago, but very little effect in the current quarter. Our deposit cost increased modestly from the prior quarter and remains among the lowest of banks within our peer group.Story continuesExclusive of PPP, period-end loans increased $1.8 billion or 3.4% on annualized during the quarter. We've achieved strong loan growth while maintaining the same underwriting standards that have allowed Zions to outperform most of our peers in several key credit metrics over the past decade. We've restrained growth in categories that are more likely to experience higher loss rates in a recessionary environment. We continue to believe the effects of higher rates and likely a slowing economy will slow portfolio growth over the next few quarters to a rate that is moderately increasing for the full year 2023. The next theme is balance sheet flexibility. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio of 78%, whereas prior to the pandemic we were running in the 85% to 90% range.We anticipate some further reduction in deposits combined with continued, albeit more moderate, loan growth, moving us closer to our historical loan-to-deposit ratio range. As we've noted in prior earnings calls, our strong liquidity position coming into this cycle afforded us the luxury of being able to prioritize the quality of deposits over quantity. This is reflected in our total cost of deposits, which the 20 basis points this quarter is among the very best of our peers. We believe, we're prepared should a recession materialize. Our pre-provision net revenue equaled an annualized 2.5% of risk weighted assets. The combination of our regulatory capital and our allowance for credit loss is strong relative to the risk profile of our balance sheet.We'd note that over the past decade, our net charge-off ratio, which has averaged a very modest 11 basis points over that period has been 75% better than the industry average, reflecting the derisking of the balance sheet we've frequently spoken off. Turning to slide 4, we are pleased with the quarterly financial results which are summarized on this slide, showing a linked quarter comparison with the third quarter. Adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue net of interest expense increased about 8% relative to the prior quarter, and adjusted pre-provision net revenue increased 20%. Those growth rates are not annualized. Our credit quality is strong and loan growth was solid. We continued to experience deposit attrition as we've allowed our liquidity to come back into a more normal range.And Paul will spend some additional time on that item. One thing to note on this slide is that we have updated the calculation of tangible common equity to exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI. As you're likely aware, GAAP accounting works to fair value through the equity account, the portion of the securities portfolio held as available for sale while not recognizing changes in the market value of other balance sheet items including deposits. As a result, this accounting treatment doesn't fully reflect the economics of the business. So, we'll be showing return on tangible common equity and any other measures such as tangible book value per share that incorporate tangible common equity, as adjusted for the volatile impact of AOCI.This also reflects how we use such measures internally. For example, one of our incentive compensation arrangements or profit sharing plan uses such a measure and we've adjusted our calculations, so it's not to produce a payout based on unrealistically high profitability. Moving to slide 5, diluted earnings per share was $1.84. Comparing the fourth quarter to the third quarter, the single most significant difference was the improvement in revenue, driven by the effect of interest rate changes on earning assets and continued strong performance from customer related non-interest income. The provision for credit loss contributed a $0.14 per share positive variance compared to last quarter as can be seen on the bottom left chart. In both quarters, the allowance increased about 5 basis points relative to loans outstanding.But in the fourth quarter, we recognize net loan recoveries instead of net charge-offs. Turning to slide 6, our third quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $420 million. The adjustments which most notably eliminate the gain or loss on securities are shown in the latter pages of the press release and the slide deck. Within the PPNR chart, the top portion of each column denotes the revenue we've received from PPP loans net of direct external professional services expense. These loans contributed only $2 million to PPNR in the fourth quarter. Exclusive of PPP income, we experienced an increase in adjusted PPNR of 71% over the year-ago period. Was that high level overview, I'm going to ask Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail related to our financial performance.Paul?Paul Burdiss: Thank you, Harris. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On slide 7, a significant highlight for us this quarter was the strong performance in average loan growth. Average non-PPP loans increased $1.9 billion, or 3.6% when compared to the third quarter. Areas of strength included commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgage and term commercial real estate, as can be seen in the appendix on slide 30. The yield on average total loans increased 64 basis points from the prior quarter, which is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates. Deposit costs increased during the quarter, but remained low. Shown on the right, our cost of total deposits rose to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter from 10 basis points in the third quarter.Our average deposits declined $3.2 billion or 4.1% linked quarter. For deeper insight into deposit volume changes, please turn to slide 8 where we break down our deposits by size. As shown here, most of our deposits come from relationships holding less than $10 million on our balance sheet. The 2022 decline in deposits came primarily from larger balance accounts. What is not shown on this page is the operational nature of our deposit accounts. We believe that deposit accounts, which are used frequently, accounts which record many inflows and outflows are stickier and less rate sensitive than other deposits due to their operational nature. Likewise, deposits invested for yield, including many of the deposits, over $10 million shown on this page are by definition, more rate sensitive.Our operating account balances were relatively stable through 2022 with a slight decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third, which we believe reflects the rising value of deposits as interest rates have increased. The increase in benchmark rates and the widening differential in our deposit rates paid when compared to other investment products created an opportunity for us to have conversations with our more rate-sensitive customers to discuss off-balance sheet products designed for larger and/or less operational deposits. A net 47% of the full year 2022 deposit attrition moved into our off-balance sheet suite of products. This served to maintain a relationship with the customer while keeping deposit costs well managed. Looking ahead, the increasing value of deposits will lead us to adjust our deposit rates accordingly as rate remains the primary lever to attract funds which are less operational in nature.While this will impact our cost of funds, we are confident that the nature of our deposit portfolio, including the proportion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits to total deposits will allow us to keep our overall cost of funds relatively low. Moving to slide 9. We show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last five quarters. The size of the securities portfolio declined slightly versus the previous quarter, but as a percent of earning assets, it remains about 9 percentage points more than it was immediately preceding the pandemic. The most significant change to the portfolio this quarter was the movement of bonds from the available-for-sale accounting classification to the held-to-maturity classification. The value of this movement was nearly $11 billion of fair value and $13 billion of amortized cost.This accounting reclassification effectively freezes $1.8 billion of an unrealized loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, which will amortize over the remaining life of the bonds and which will limit the impact on reported accumulated other comprehensive income due to changes in interest rates. We anticipate that money market and investment securities balances combined will continue to decline over the near term, which will create a source of funds for the rest of the balance sheet. Our revenue is primarily balance sheet driven. This quarter, 82% of our revenue is from net interest income. Slide 10 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows the recent five-quarter trend for both.Net interest income on the bars reflects the benefit of both loan growth and higher interest rates, while the net interest margin in the white boxes largely reflects the impact of the rising interest rate environment on earning yields, combined with our ability -- earning asset yields, combined with our ability to contain funding costs. The right-hand chart on this page shows the linked quarter effect of certain items on the net interest margin. Overall, earning asset yields improved 64 basis points, while the cost of interest-bearing funds increased 61 basis points, reflecting a 3 basis-point expansion in our interest rate spread. However, nearly half of our earning assets are funded with noninterest-bearing sources of funds. Therefore, the 3 basis-point expansion in interest rate spread is augmented by an increase of 26 basis points in the value of noninterest-bearing funds in the higher rate -- higher interest rate environment.These factors combine to produce a 29 basis-point expansion in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter. Slide 11 provides information about our interest rate sensitivity. As a reminder, we have been using the terms latent interest rate sensitivity and the emergent interest rate sensitivity to describe the effects on net interest income of rate changes that have occurred as well as those that have yet to occur as implied by the shape of the yield curve. Importantly, the balance sheet is assumed to remain unchanged in size in these descriptions. Regarding latent sensitivity, the in-place yield curve as of December 31st, which was notably more inverted than the curve at September 30th, will work through our net interest income over time.jan-huber-J51Wt_AvKbc-unsplashThe difference from the prior period's disclosures of latent sensitivity is the shape of the curve and the accelerated pull-through of net interest income growth, which was attributable in part to our lower-than-expected deposit and funding beta as we begin to increase our deposit rates to reflect the increased value of money and the limited rate movements we have reported so far, our modeling would now estimate a deposit beta of approximately 18% compared to the beta of 5% observed cycle to date. Therefore, given the model increase in interest expense and using a stable sized balance sheet, the latent sensitivity, interest rate risk measure, indicates a decline in net interest income of about 1% in the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.Regarding emergent sensitivity, if the December 31, 2022 forward path of interest rates were to materialize and using a stable sized balance sheet, the emergent sensitivity measure indicates a decline in net interest income of about 2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Again, this change in outlook can be traced to strong recent net interest income performance and the inverted interest rate curve. With respect to traditional interest rate risk disclosures, our estimated interest rate sensitivity to a 100 basis-point parallel interest rate shock using a same sized balance sheet has declined by about 2 percentage points from the third quarter and about 10 percentage points from the beginning of the year.As rates have risen and downside risk to net interest income has increased, we've been moderating our asset sensitivity primarily through interest rate swaps, while generally maintaining customer operating deposit balances and allowing certain rate-sensitive deposits to decline. The reported change in interest rate sensitivity this quarter largely reflects the recent decline in deposits and a higher net interest income denominator. As a result, this traditional interest rate risk disclosure represents a parallel -- as a reminder, sorry. As a reminder, this traditional interest rate risk disclosure represents a parallel and instantaneous shock, while the latent and emergent views reflect the prevailing yield curve at December 31st. Our outlook for net interest income for the full year of 2023 relative to the full year 2022 is increasing.While there will be seasonality along the way with fewer days in the first half of the year, for example, we expect that by the fourth quarter of 2023, including the latent and emergent sensitivity as well as an expected increase in loans, net interest income will be modestly higher than that reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving on to noninterest income and total revenue on slide 12. Customer-related noninterest income was $153 million, a decrease of 2% versus the prior quarter and an increase of 1% over the prior year. As we noted last quarter, we modified our non-sufficient funds and overdraft fee practices near the beginning of the third quarter, which has reduced our noninterest income by about $3 million per quarter. Improvement in treasury management fees has allowed us to make up the loss of that revenue.Our outlook for customer-related noninterest income for the 2023 full year is moderately increasing relative to the full year 2022 results. On the right side of the slide, revenue, which is the sum of net interest income and customer-related noninterest income, is shown. Revenue grew by 24% from a year ago and when excluding PPP income, it grew by 32% over the same period. Noninterest expense on slide 13 decreased 2% from the prior quarter to $471 million. The reduction is primarily due to a net decrease of certain incentive compensation items within salaries and benefits. The total of the remaining expense categories remained relatively flat to the third quarter. We continue to feel the influence of inflation and expect to continue to hire additional staff to support growth.We reiterate our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense to increase moderately for the full year of 2023 relative to the full year of 2022. Another highlight for the quarter was the continued strong credit quality across the loan portfolio, as illustrated on slide 14. Relative to the prior quarter, we saw continued improvement in the balance of criticized and classified loans. Recoveries from balances previously charged off led to a net recovery of 2 basis points of average non-PPP loans in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of 21 basis points in the prior quarter. Notably, our nonperforming asset ratio and classified loan ratio continue to improve and are at very healthy levels. Slide 15 details the recent trend in our allowance for credit losses or ACL over the past several quarters.At the end of the fourth quarter, the ACL was $636 million, a $46 million increase from the third quarter. The linked quarter ACL increase can be ascribed to loan growth and weakening economic forecast. The reserve ratio to total loans was up 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.15% of non-PPP loans. Our ACL will continue to reflect the size and composition of our loan portfolio and evolving macroeconomic forecast. Our loss absorbing capital position is shown on slide 16. We believe that our capital position is aligned with the balance sheet and operating risk of the Bank. The CET1 ratio grew slightly in the fourth quarter to 9.7%. Although CET1 -- the CET1 ratio remained relatively flat, I'd like to point out the significant amount of earnings retained over the past year.The balance of common equity Tier 1 in capital grew by over $400 million or 7% in 2022. However, risk-weighted assets during the year grew by $7.5 billion or 13%, primarily driven by loan growth. We repurchased $50 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and $200 million for the year. As a reminder, share repurchase and dividend decisions are made by our Board of Directors, and as such, we expect to announce any capital actions for the first quarter in conjunction with our regularly scheduled Board meetings this coming Friday. Our goal continues to be -- continues to maintain a CET1 capital ratio slightly above the peer median while managing to a below-average risk profile. Slide 17 summarizes the financial outlook provided over the course of this presentation.This outlook represents our best current estimate for the financial performance in full year 2023 as compared to actual results reported for the full year 2022. This is a change from our historical approach where we traditionally provide an outlook for a single quarter one year out. We plan to return to that approach when reporting financial performance over the remainder of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks.

The bottom line increased 37.3% from the year-ago quarter. We had projected earnings of $1.57 per share.Results were primarily aided by an improvement in net interest income (NII), which was driven by rising rates and increasing loan demand. However, higher provisions, a rise in non-interest expenses, and lower deposit balances and non-interest income were the headwinds, which hurt results to some extent.Probably because of these negatives, shares of the company lost 3.7% in after-market trading despite better-than-expected results.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $277 million, up 33.8% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $233.2 million.Earnings for 2022 were $5.79 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.60. The bottom line declined 14.7% from the year-ago period.

The top line marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.18 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $3.17 billion.Quarterly NII was $720 million, growing 30.2% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly driven by higher interest rates and a favorable change in the composition of interest-earning assets. Likewise, the net interest margin (NIM) expanded 95 basis points (bps) to 3.53%. Our estimates for NII and NIM were $689.2 million and 3.30%.Non-interest income was $153 million, decreasing 19.5% year over year. The decline was due to a fall in retail and business banking fees, loan-related fees, and income, capital markets and foreign exchange fees, other customer-related fees, and dividends and other income. We had projected non-interest income of $165.7 million. In the reported quarter, the company recorded a net securities loss against a gain in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted non-interest expenses were $472 million, up 5.8% year over year. We had expected this metric to be $502.7 million.The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) was 52.9%, down from 60.8% in the prior-year period. A fall in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2022, net loans and leases held for investment were $55.1 billion, up 3.2% from the prior quarter.

The government should stop them,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-moderna-pfizer-jacking-price-194129319.html,1674589289,STORY,"['MRNA', 'PFE']","[Doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine wait to be administered at a clinic. Until now, the government has covered all the costs for the shots. Soon, you'll be paying more. (Eli Hartman / Associated Press)Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of drug company Moderna, could barely restrain his pride in issuing his annual letter to shareholders on Jan. 3.""Since the beginning, it has been our mission to deliver on the promise of mRNA technology for patients,"" Bancel wrote, referring to the vaccines in the company's product pipeline that use short pieces of genetic code to help cells build immunity.""And we delivered at speed with our mRNA vaccine against COVID-19,"" he continued. ""As our first approved product, it has impacted hundreds of millions of lives around the world. ... We are harnessing the power of mRNA to create a new category of medicines and a company that maximizes its impact on human health.""Moderna is committed to pricing that reflects the value that COVID-19 vaccines bring to patients, healthcare systems, and society.Moderna spokesman Christopher RidleyA couple of pertinent points were missing from Bancel's 2,700 words of self-congratulation. One was the contribution of the federal government to the company's success.That included a research grant of almost $1 billion from the government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, through 2020, plus a $1.5-billion federal purchase guarantee in 2020 for COVID vaccines before testing was even completed — a deal that materially reduced Moderna's financial risks in developing the vaccine.Nor does it count the millions, possibly billions, in federally funded basic research at academic institutions and government laboratories in mRNA technology — the foundation of the product developed by Moderna.Also glossed over was Moderna's intention to raise the price of its COVID vaccine from the estimated $20.69 per dose paid by the federal government through December 2022 (for 1.2 billion doses of COVID vaccines, including Moderna's product and a similar mRNA formulation produced by Pfizer), to as much as $130 per dose.Pfizer, which did not receive federal research funding but did obtain a government purchase guarantee, has also announced a price increase to as much as $130 per dose.Story continuesPfizer's vaccine also derives from basic government-funded research; indeed, on its website the company acknowledges the foundational work on mRNA technology by Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania, research that was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.Both companies have justified the planned price hikes in part by citing the savings in healthcare costs the vaccines have produced.In an email, a Pfizer spokesman told me that its vaccine and other therapies have ""saved hundreds of thousands of lives [and] tens of billions of dollars in health care costs."" Pfizer ""has priced the vaccine to ensure the price is consistent with the value delivered,"" the email said.Moderna makes a similar point. ""Moderna is committed to pricing that reflects the value that COVID-19 vaccines bring to patients, healthcare systems, and society,"" company spokesman Christopher Ridley said by email.It's impossible to overstate the moral depravity of this argument. The companies are saying, in essence, that they deserve a cut of the savings in lives and money attributable to their products, and they'll decide the size of that cut for themselves — independent of considerations such as the cost of developing and manufacturing the drugs or the effect that higher prices will have on patients' access.The COVID vaccines have sharply reduced mortality rates from the pandemic across the board. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)No industry other than pharmaceuticals asserts that its prices should be based on the higher costs of alternatives, but it's a familiar factor in drug pricing. Gilead Sciences, for instance, set the price of Sovaldi and Harvoni, its hepatitis C treatments, above $80,000 for a 12-week course based on the drugs' ""value premium"" — the higher cost of alternative treatments.After a U.S. Senate committee issued a blistering report about Gilead's pricing strategy, the company stated that the drugs were ""priced in line with the previous standards of care"" and that the prices ""are less than the cost of prior regimens, even though our therapies have significantly higher cure rates and very few side effects.""The price increases of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines almost inevitably will translate into lower vaccination rates, even as executives at both vaccine companies assert that the price increases will be invisible to most Americans.""Anyone with commercial or government insurance who is eligible to be vaccinated should be able to access the vaccine without any out-of-pocket payments,"" Pfizer executive Angela Lukin told Wall Street analysts on a conference call Oct. 20, when the company announced its proposed list price of $110 to $130 per dose.That's highly misleading, however. Underinsured or uninsured Americans could be charged the full price, which would put the vaccine beyond their ability to pay. To the extent insurers or Medicare and Medicaid would shoulder most of the cost for their enrollees, it could be reflected in higher premiums.Pfizer says that some uninsured Americans will be eligible for the company's patient assistance program, which covers some co-pays for its drugs. But that program requires an application and considerable paperwork; it's no substitute for walking into a pharmacy and receiving the shot on request, as has been possible through the government program.Make no mistake: This is a public health issue. The government's COVID vaccination program prevented more than 18.5 million excess hospitalizations and 3.2 million excess deaths, according to research by the Commonwealth Fund.""Without vaccination, there would have been nearly 120 million more COVID-19 infections,"" estimated the fund, which also calculated that the vaccination program ""saved the U.S. $1.15 trillion ... in medical costs that would otherwise have been incurred.Government statistics plainly show that vaccinated individuals have a sharply reduced COVID-related mortality rate, with the gains multiplying for patients who are fully vaccinated and boosted.Even though there's no question that the vaccines have saved society money and lives, that leaves the question of how much in profits the manufacturers deserve to reap from them — as well as how to calculate the cost of reduced access to these products due to higher prices.The list-price increases are only part of the story. The other side of the coin is the profit margin Moderna and Pfizer expect to see from the vaccines. According to an analysis by Oxfam, the mRNA vaccines could be produced for as little as $1.18 to $2.85 per dose, meaning that even at the government price the companies were collecting enormous profits.There would appear to be plenty of headroom for Moderna and Pfizer to profit from the vaccines even at lower prices. Pfizer has projected annual sales of its vaccine at $34 billion and Moderna at $18 billion to $19 billion. Those estimates were based on 2022 sales, before price increases take effect. Government authorities have started to talk about a regime of annual COVID vaccine boosters, similar to flu vaccines, implying a steady stream of revenue for the companies for years to come.The price increases reflect what Moderna and Pfizer both refer to as the transition to commercial marketing of the vaccines. That's necessary because the federal government has run out of money to buy doses and distribute them for free. Last year, President Biden asked Congress for $3.9 billion ""to help ensure ready access to vaccinations, testing, treatment and operational support"" for Americans. He didn't get it.The effect of federal funding for Moderna has been stupendous — and a large proportion of that gain has flowed directly to shareholders. According to the company's most recent quarterly report, the company spent $2.1 billion on research and development in the first nine months of 2022. But it spent $2.9 billion in the same period on stock buybacks, which pump up the value of its stock.Those repurchases were part of $6 billion in stock buybacks authorized last year by the Moderna board, of which more than $3 billion remains available. Basic math tells you that had Moderna not received its more than $1 billion in R&amp;D assistance from the government, it would have had at least that much less to upstream to shareholders.As I've written before, it's the cowardice of political leaders and government regulators that allows drug firms such as Moderna and Pfizer to dictate higher prices for products developed in part with government funding.The government arguably has authority over pricing and distribution of products developed with federal funding, such as the COVID vaccines. The key factor is the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which allowed private companies to commercialize inventions that grew out of federally funded research, but it reserved certain rights for the government to protect taxpayers’ investments.Chief among them are “march-in rights.” These allow the government to require that a federally funded drug be licensed to other manufacturers, or to offer a license itself to alternative drugmakers to ensure that the drug is widely accessible. Those rights can be exercised if the government concludes that a manufacturer hasn’t taken sufficient steps to make a product publicly available or hasn’t brought it out on “terms that are reasonable.”The government has never exercised its march-in rights, though it has occasionally threatened to do so to extract concessions from manufacturers. But as drug prices skyrocket, pressure on federal authorities to take action is intensifying.Prostate cancer patients, for instance, have been pressing the Department of Health and Human Services to take action on Xtandi, a wonder drug for the disease that was developed at UCLA with substantial funding from the Pentagon and the National Institutes of Health.The average wholesale price of Xtandi, for which Pfizer holds a manufacturing license, comes to $189,800 a year. (UCLA had collected more than $520 million in royalties from the drug when it sold the rights in 2016.) To date, Health and Human Services has failed even to hold a hearing on a year-old petition by prostate cancer patients aimed at bringing the drug price down by exercising march-in rights.The COVID vaccines could be another test case. Few drugs on the market today can match their capacity to advance public health and few may be as sensitive to the level of price increases planned by Moderna and Pfizer.This is a subject on which the federal government cannot and should not remain silent.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"
219,8e66bb1d-089e-3cf8-b5a1-70c0259aef89,PFE,2023-01-25,Pfizer (PFE) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-pfe-expected-beat-earnings-150003572.html,1674572403,STORY,['PFE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Pfizer (PFE) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.8%.Revenues are expected to be $24.2 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.56% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pfizer?For Pfizer, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.48%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Pfizer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pfizer would post earnings of $1.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of +21.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pfizer appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the past years, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy. US equities suffered huge losses in 2022, marking their worst year since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. However, dividend stocks sustained solid footing during the year due to their ability to generate stable income for shareholders. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up 10% from 2021. Moreover, most dividend indexes ended 2022 with positive returns, according to a report by Morningstar. The report also mentioned that there was a 20 percentage-point differential between dividend stocks and the broader market last year.Considering the market volatility and investors’ inclination toward dividend securities, many companies steadily raised their payouts over the years. High inflationary periods also bode well for dividend growth in the past. During the 2010s, dividend payments in the S&amp;P 500 grew by 155% after recording a 40% growth in each of the previous two decades, as reported by CME Group. The report also revealed that dividend payments rose by 6% and 12% during the high-inflation decades of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively.Analysts are positive about dividend growth this year as well. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, spoke about dividends in his December interview with Wall Street Journal. He asserted that corporate balance sheets are strong enough to generate enough cash for future dividends. The same report also mentioned that many companies have shown confidence in their cash flows and capital investments to fulfill shareholder obligations through dividends in the upcoming years. Among the companies that have gained investors’ attention over the past years include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

This compares to earnings of $2.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's biggest maker of health care products would post earnings of $2.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.55, delivering a surprise of 2.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Johnson &amp; Johnson , which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, posted revenues of $23.71 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $24.8 billion.

News Corp is the parent of publications such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and publisher HarperCollins. The Murdoch family owns about 40% of both companies. The Special Committees set up at both firms to explore the potential merger have been dissolved.Investors rejoice over the scrapped Fox-News Corp dealMurdoch had pursued a merger as a way to secure a bigger resource pool for further acquisitions, but investors saw little merit in overcomplicating a swelling business instead of simplifying it.They welcomed Murdoch’s change of heart. “This is the right decision,” said Adam Katz, co-founder and chief investment officer at activist investor Irenic, which owns 2.6% of the class B voting shares of News Corp.When the talks started, Irenic was among the first companies to object to a merger, suggesting that a spin-off of News Corp’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones was a better option.Soon after, Independent Franchise Partners, a bigger investor that owns 7% of News Corp’s Class A shares and 6.4% in Fox Corp, also pushed back on the deal in November. Then, T. Rowe Price, which owns almost 18% of News Corp, joined the growing chorus opposing the deal.“It’s more constructive to help form the process than try to push back against any proposal once it’s been made,” Vincent DeAugustino, one of the portfolio managers who oversees T. Rowe’s investment in News Corp, said at the time.Story continuesQuotable: Thumbs down for Fox-News Corp merger“Every investor I’ve spoken to in the last 10 years on News Corp has expressed that they think the company is way too complicated and should be simplified by selling assets or spinning off assets. Putting the two (News Corp and Fox) together makes no sense to us.” —Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research Partners.A brief history of the Fox and News Corp split and possible reunionJune 2013: Murdoch splits his $75 billion (at the time) News Corp into two—one is the loss-making publishing arm that retains the name, and the other is the more profitable Hollywood studio 21st Century Fox.March 2019: Murdoch sells 21st Century Fox to Disney for over $71 billion. The deal included movie production arms 20th Century, TV studios, a range of Fox’s cable channels, its 30% share of Hulu streaming, and more. Fox retained its news channel, sports channel, and a handful of others.October 2022: Murdoch writes letters to the boards at Fox and News Corp, asking them to consider a merger. The reunited entity would be worth around $26 billion, putting it in the league of Warner Bros Discovery, albeit far behind behemoths like Disney and Comcast.Was the Fox-News Corp deal a veiled succession planning attempt?When talk of the merger started, rumours swirled about 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan. But the company issued a staunch rebuttal.“The proposal is 100% based on business rationale. Any commentary that implies it has to do with succession planning is absurd and comes from sources with no knowledge of the strategy,” a spokesman for Murdoch told Reuters in November.Related stories🏠 Rupert Murdoch is officially a remote worker now💰 Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox because even his media giant was too small to compete🎬 Everything Disney’s takeover of Fox means for the future of entertainmentMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Let's kick it off with Microsoft. You're looking at gains of just about 4% here after-hours, the company beating expectations when it comes to adjusted EPS, $2.32. The estimate was for $2.30. Revenue just a bit light there, 52.75 billion. The estimate was for 52.93 billion.But the cloud business growth there, that's what's really driving the stock here after-hours. Intelligent Cloud revenue beating the Street's expectation, 21.51 billion. And that's growth of about 18%, growth of 24% in constant currency. Again, you're looking at the stock pop here, up about 4% after-hours. And competitor Amazon, AWS, the cloud number there boosting Amazon's stock after-hours, looking at Amazon's gains of just about 3%.Let's take a look at Capital One, that stock under pressure here following its earnings report, off just over 1 and 1/2%. Their fourth quarter EPS missed the Street's expectations, coming in just about $1 below at $2.82. The estimate was for $3.79. Revenue, a slight beat there, just over 9 billion. Provisions for credit losses higher than what the Street was looking for here, 2.42 billion. The estimate was for $1.85 billion, really indicative of the broader economic environment and the downturn maybe that we could potentially see here over the coming months.Car delinquency and also auto delinquency, both of those numbers growth up about over on a year over year basis. We're looking at losses of just about 1 and 1/2%. Taking a look at Texas Instruments, that stock is now back in positive territory after-hours, up just about 2/10 of a percent. Sales, though, dropping for the first time since 2020. They also offered a pretty tepid forecast. Some of their expectations there at the lower end of Wall Street's range.Story continuesTaking a look at some of these numbers, revenue declining 3.4% year over year. But it was better than what the Street was looking for. They reported 4.67 billion. The estimate was for 4.61 billion. EPS, $2.13-- that was better than what the Street was looking for. Gains of just about 2/10 of a percent.Also keep a close eye on Fox and News Corp.

News Corp currently has a market capitalization of about $11 billion, while Fox is valued at a shade over $17 billion.Story continuesMurdoch proposed reuniting his media empire last fall, arguing that together the publishing and entertainment companies he split apart in 2013 would give the combined company greater scale in news, live sports and information, sources said.Several people close to the Murdochs viewed the attempt to combine the media companies as driven by the 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan Murdoch, a notion the company described as ""absurd"" in November.Some of News Corp’s larger shareholders, including Independent Franchise Partners and T. Rowe Price balked at the idea.Rupert Murdoch and his family trust control about 40% of News Corp and Fox. Had a deal been reached, they would have abstained from voting their shares when each company sought shareholder approval for the merger, because of the potential conflict of interest. This made securing the backing of other major shareholders a prerequisite to the deal going through.'RIGHT DECISION'Activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which was among the first to say that the proposed reunion would likely undervalue News Corp, on Tuesday applauded the decision to not move forward.""This is the right decision,"" Irenic's chief investment officer Adam Katz said. ""Looking ahead, News Corp has an opportunity to create substantial value for its owners.""News Corp agreed to buy Move in 2014 for $950 million to diversify its digital real estate business which, at the time, was primarily in Australia.Since then, News Corp investors had been calling on the company to spin off its digital real estate assets. Irenic also publicly urged News Corp to sell its Dow Jones media properties.On a slide-deck presentation in November, Irenic estimated News Corp's 80% stake in Move was worth $1.4 billion on $2.47 per share.In a letter to News Corp employees on Tuesday, News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said: ""In my note to you in October, I said the Special Committee assessment would have no impact on our current operations; that was indeed the case, and remains so following today’s announcement.""

NUE has already commissioned some of its growth projects. These should drive growth and strengthen Nucor’s position as a low-cost producer.Story continuesNUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market. NUE remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive Nucor’s margins.Zacks Rank #2 Nucor has an Earnings ESP of +3.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.5% over the last 30 days. NUE recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.9%.

Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13% higher than the level recorded in fourth-quarter 2019.AAL’s debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025.

235,6c0ae4a4-3a8f-3b12-b0c3-70e4b8a2ddc2,IBM,2023-01-25,2 Stocks to Consider Buying Before Earnings This Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-consider-buying-earnings-205508678.html,1674593708,STORY,"['URI', 'IBM']","[This week’s earnings will be important for investors to get a clearer picture of the outlook for many larger-cap stocks that are crucial to the broader stock market and economy.With that being said, here are two stocks investors shouldn’t overlook and may want to consider buying going into their fourth-quarter releases.International Business Machines IBM The first stock investors will want to pay attention to is International Business Machines (IBM) which is set to report Q4 earnings on January 25.Evolving into a cloud and data provider, IBM has shown the ability to manage its bottom line effectively despite a challenging economy and slowing top-line growth.IBM currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its current Fiscal year 2022 and Q4 earnings estimate revisions trending higher again despite fiscal 2023 earnings estimates slightly declining.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Fourth-quarter earnings estimates have now gone up to $3.60 per share in the last week compared to $3.57 a share, which is a sign that IBM could top bottom-line expectations. This would also represent 7% year-over-year growth from Q4 2021 and round out IBM’s Fiscal 2022 earnings at $9.14 a share, a 15% increase from FY21.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are projected at $15.55 billion for Q4 which would be a -7% decrease from the prior year quarter but shows IBM is making the best of its operating environment. Total sales for FY22 would be $59.39 billion, a -16% YoY decrease with sales at $70.79 billion in 2021.Earnings ESP: As fore mentioned IBM is expected to top Q4 earnings expectations with an Expected Surprise Prediction of 1.90% as the Zacks Consensus is $3.60 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus is $3.67 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite the dip on the top line, IBM’s management seems to be effectively navigating the challenging operating environment as indicated in the company’s earnings. On that note, a Q4 earnings beat and better-than-expected guidance could lead to more upside in IBM stock which is very impressive considering the difficulties higher inflation has inflicted on most tech companies.Story continuesPlus, over the last two years, IBM is now up +19% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s +3% and the Nasdaq’s -17% as the company continues to diversify its business operations.United Rentals URI Another stock investors may want to consider buying this week is United Rentals (URI) which is set to report earnings on January 25. As the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals’ stock continues to look very intriguing.United Rentals’ customer base is loyal and includes construction, industrial, and utility companies that also include municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors, and homeowners among others.United Rentals currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimates trending higher for the company’s current fiscal 2022 and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: United Rentals looks poised to have another strong quarter on the bottom line. Fourth quarter earnings are expected to be up 36% YoY at $10.09 per share compared to $7.39 a share in Q4 2021.This would have United Rentals finishing Fiscal 2022 with earnings up a stellar 48% at $32.60 per share compared to $22.06 per share in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Q4 sales are expected at $3.29 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter. More impressively United Rentals would post 20% top-line growth for FY22 rounding out the year with sales at $11.64 billion compared to $9.72 billion in 2021.Earnings ESP: After beating earnings expectations in four consecutive quarters the trend could continue with the Zacks Consensus for URI’s Q4 earnings at $10.09 per share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $10.22 a share. This indicates United Rentals could beat expectations by 1.31%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: The top and bottom line growth for United Rentals has been very impressive and the rising earnings estimate revisions going into Q4 earnings is a sign that URI’s stock could continue its stellar performance, up 26% over the last year and 662% over the last decade to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500.Bottom Line IBM and United Rentals are two companies that continue to outperform on their bottom lines and this could lead to more upside in these stocks. Their ability to effectively manage operating costs in a challenging economy and operating environment is very impressive and could separate IBM and URI stock from others in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

IBM should post fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.59 per share, up from $3.35 per share a year earlier, while revenue may have slipped 2% to $16.4 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. IBM's defensive positioning as a provider of essential enterprise IT software and services with a high proportion of recurring revenue has propped up the share price but will be tested by the recent slowdown in tech spending.Continue reading]"

The central bank already gave hint by increasing the interest rate by 50 basis points after four consecutive 75-basis point rate hikes.Also, data released last week showed that wholesale prices declined in December, which is a sign of easing inflation. Also, Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s comments on Friday indicated that he prefers a 25-basis point quarterly rise in interest rates.

238,7a9e4570-f23c-3044-95f1-51d3874cfa89,IBM,2023-01-25,4 Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Technology Solutions Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-challenging-technology-131001595.html,1674565801,STORY,"['HPE', 'IBM', '^GSPC', 'PAR']","[Players in the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry are grappling with lingering Covid-induced supply-chain bottlenecks. A challenging macroeconomic landscape with rising inflation is also a concern. Soaring prices and persistent delays in customer acceptance have resulted in high levels of backlog and cast a pall on the industry’s prospects. Nonetheless, International Business Machines IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE, Agilysys AGYS and PAR Technology PAR are a few industry participants to watch as they are benefiting from the rise in advanced forms of data management, the rapid shift from traditional silos, increased demand for integration of deployment techniques as well as modern application development.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry comprises companies that provide advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics. These industry players are increasing investments in data modernization and analytics, cyber defense, remote work, automation and contact-less services, customer &amp; employee experience, and supply-chain modernization, which accelerate growth in digital transformation services. Some industry participants also provide technological solutions (both products and services) to aid organizations in connecting, interacting and transacting with customers. Others develop and market information recognition, data entry software, systems as well as technologies.4 Computer - Integrated Systems Industry Trends in FocusIntegrated Solutions Driving Demand: The industry is benefiting from rising demand for integrated solutions across small, medium and large-scale enterprises, along with increasing investments in IoT, big data, AI and blockchain software technologies. Moreover, business analytics, cloud computing, mobile, and security and social businesses present significant opportunities to an increasing number of remote workers in the wake of the coronavirus-induced work-from-home wave. The industry players are anticipated to benefit from recovering global IT spending, as predicted by Gartner.Solid Adoption of Multi-Cloud Model: The growing adoption of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is also expanding the scope of the industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Supply-Chain Bottlenecks and Backlogs: Industry participants are witnessing supply constraints, softness in server demand and cognitive applications, as well as delays in customer acceptance, in turn resulting in high levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, High Performance Computing &amp; Mass Storage Class and Storage. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange — primarily due to the current macroeconomic scenario and headwinds in emerging markets — does not bode well for the industry.Semiconductor Chip Shortage Mars Prospects: Industry participants are facing challenges owing to the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud. Further, lower spending across Data-Center Systems — primarily due to component shortages like memory and CPUs, as well as deceleration in hyperscale spending — is likely to dampen the prospects of the industry participants.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163, which places it in the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Jan 31, 2022, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2023 has moved down 9.4%.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching based on a strong earnings outlook. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry has underperformed the broader Computer and Technology sector and Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 21.2% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 and broader Computer and Technology sector’s respective declines of 11.1% and 0.1%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month P/S, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer-integrated systems stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 1.64X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.52X. It is also below the sector’s trailing 12-month P/S of 4.26X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.15X and as low as 1.14X, with the median being at 1.61X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio4 Computer-Integrated Systems Providers to WatchHewlett Packard Enterprise: HPE is benefiting from improved supply-chain execution and higher demand for its cloud services owing to the ongoing digital transformation. Hewlett Packard views AI, Industrial Internet of Things and distributed computing as the next major markets.HPE’s efforts to shift focus to higher-margin offerings like Intelligent Edge and Aruba Central Hyperconverged Infrastructure are aiding the bottom line. HPE’s shares have risen 1.8% in the past year.The buyout of San Francisco-based startup, Pachyderm, is expected to strengthen Hewlett Packard's (HPE) AI-at-scale offerings, bolstering its reproducible AI capabilities. Pachyderm’s reproducible AI software improves HPE’s existing AI-at-scale offerings by efficiently maximizing machine learning initiatives of the data scientists, optimizing their infrastructure cost and ensuring that data is reliable and safe anywhere in the AI ecosystem.However, organizations have been shifting to cloud computing owing to their maintenance-free and cost-effective structure compared with standalone servers, which can undermine this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s near-term prospects.

The firms aim to explore how quantum technology will benefit a variety of industries and disciplines, including finance, chemistry and artificial intelligence through significant reductions of development time and operational costs. These initiatives are likely to be reflected in the upcoming segment results.Key Developments in Q4During fourth-quarter 2022, IBM inked an agreement to acquire Octo to establish one of the largest digital transformation partners to the federal government. The buyout of this U.S.-based IT modernization and digital transformation services provider will complement IBM's existing strengths in this domain and augment its ability to better serve the federal agencies.Story continuesOverall ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Software is pegged at $6,762 million.The consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $15,548 million.

U.S. Census Bureau data show women represented about 15% of all engineers in 2019. This reality motivated Ayala to help organize an event for high school girls in late 2022 at Marathon Petroleum's El Paso, Texas, refinery where she works, so they could interact with female employees in careers related to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to gain firsthand knowledge of these disciplines.""The refinery had never hosted anything like this,"" Ayala said. ""We had 40 girls spend an entire day at the facility, which involved presentations from women engineers, scientists and operators, a site tour that included the laboratory, a panel discussion and several hands-on learning activities.""Among other immersive experiences during the Girls in STEM Day event, students designed water filters and tested the water they filtered at the site's laboratory. They also put on safety gloves to turn valves on a piping system demonstrator and took part in a tabletop exercise that simulated the transfer of refined product from one tank to another, using water in containers connected to a system of plastic tubes.Refinery participants came from multiple departments, including technical services, engineering, the laboratory, operations, environmental, process safety management and safety. Ayala said her co-organizers found a creative way to introduce concepts behind the personal protective equipment (PPE) that must be worn by refinery employees for various tasks.Story continues""We had PPE fashion shows where we invited ladies to walk a ‘runway' wearing various types of PPE while our industrial hygienists described for students the purposes of their clothing and equipment.""The girls at the event were juniors and seniors from several area high schools who had to submit applications and be selected to take part. Before the day ended, one of the students was awarded a $1,000 scholarship for college, based on her application and level of participation.Given the feedback about the gathering, efforts to plan a similar event in 2023 are already taking shape.""These girls were very smart and asked questions that were very advanced for their age. We definitely want to do this again in the coming year,"" Ayala said.Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Tuesday, January 24, 2023, Press release pictureThe Girls in STEM Day planning team included (l-r) Environmental Engineer Yvonne Ojeda, Environmental Engineer Rebecca Ayala, Sustainability Coordinator and Refining Engineer Lauren Pugh, Tech Services Supervisor Nina Jensen and Products Control Manager Lisa Bielamowicz.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/736550/High-School-Girls-Put-STEM-Education-Into-Practice-With-Refinerys-Female-Mentors]"

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +326.2%.Revenues are expected to be $32.2 billion, down 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 24.97% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum?For Marathon Petroleum, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Marathon Petroleum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of $6.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.81, delivering a surprise of +14.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marathon Petroleum appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned +28.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has gained 15.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $0.56 per share, indicating a change of +113.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +274.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.47 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +196.4%. This estimate has changed +30% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of +20.3% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, United is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For United, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51%. For the current and next fiscal years, $52.42 billion and $54.34 billion estimates indicate +16.6% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $12.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.4%. EPS of $2.46 for the same period compares with -$1.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.39%. The EPS surprise was +18.84%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Oppenheimer initiated coverage this morning with an outperform rating and $190 price target. The analyst saying that they see potential for a strong multi-year profit recovery. The bullishness caught the attention of Sozz. That's where we find his take today.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, any time you write a 75-page research report, as this was, it definitely catches my attention as someone who used to write these. Let's start on Target here. The bull case for Oppenheimer on Target essentially boils down to three things. They see Target's inventory position starting to improve as the year goes along. Of course, Target was stuck with a lot of excess inventory. And they warned about that towards, really, last summer. And then it seemed to get worse going into the third quarter.They also see freight costs starting to cool down a bit, as inflation comes off its peak. That's a good thing not just for Target, but a lot of other retailers that ship large quantities of goods like Walmart, you name it, Costco. Also cost cuts boost profits. Target has started to pull back on some of their expansion initiatives, notably-- not necessarily the amount of store openings, but just their manufacturing-- their distribution center footprint. They were rolling that out very aggressively across the country, little distribution centers to get packages to people's houses quicker. They've started to pull back on that a little bit.Now my guide here on when you may want to consider nibbling on Target shares-- and of course, like I always mention, I'm not telling you to buy, sell, or hold any stock-- this is just how I would approach thinking about Target if you are inclined to own a name like this, a consumer name like this. First, you visit a Target store, and the store doesn't feel stuffed with inventory. Sometimes, in retail analysis, it could be that simple.Story continuesAnd I think-- I really like what Jonathan Johnson over at Overstock just told us. It could be a tale of two years for these retailers, where they used the first half of this year to clear a lot of excess inventory, maybe worn again, reset guidance and reset expectations, and then enter the holiday season for this year in a much, much, much cleaner inventory position and show some better margins.Number two, there's a clear pivot to better consumer spending data. The consumer data right now, I would argue, is not exactly bullish on a lot of retailers notably that skew towards the higher end consumer like Target does. Yes, they are a discounter, but they do get a higher income shopper into that store compared to a Walmart and the dollar stores. And then lastly, inflation comes closer to the Fed's 2% goal and rate hike stop. That, just on paper, will-- or theoretically, should make it a little bit cheaper for consumers to go visit Target and stock up on their daily essentials.My take here, it's one of my favorite stores I went to Target last weekend, coming back from the World Economic Forum here with Julie. I did my shopping. I can get it all done in one place. But the next earnings report from Target in a few weeks could be rough, and not just rough in terms of the quarter here, guys. There is a sense on the Street that they might reset earnings expectations one last time, despite a series of warnings, and that maybe the Street hasn't factored in another potential warning from Target in a few weeks. The other key catalyst after earnings-- February 28 analyst day for the company.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, some of what we can expect with Target's earnings may have already shown up in some of the retail sales data as well when you look at some of the discretionary categories. And Target has leaned into making sure that anything in the home category or the apparel category as well, that that moves in through consumers, but those were some of the more challenged categories within the most recent December report, too.BRIAN SOZZI: Right, and I'll just-- Target is still one of the best run retailers in the game.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.]"

The fourth quarter of 2022 reflected a resurgence in COVID-19 in China, which negatively impacted procedure volumes in the region. The fourth quarter of 2021 also reflected COVID-19 disruptions later in the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, which impacted our procedures. The compound annual growth rate between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 14%.The Company placed 369 da Vinci Surgical Systems, a decrease of 4% compared with 385 in the fourth quarter of 2021.The Company grew its da Vinci Surgical System installed base to 7,544 systems as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 12% compared with 6,730 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.Fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $1.66 billion increased 7% compared with $1.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive was $325 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with $381 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2021.Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP* net income attributable to Intuitive was $439 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, compared with $473 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2021.The Company repurchased $1 billion of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2022.Q4 Financial SummaryGross profit, income from operations, net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and net income per diluted share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. are reported on a GAAP and non-GAAP* basis. Additionally, constant currency revenue growth is reported on a non-GAAP* basis.

The higher fourth quarter revenue was driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by a decline in system placements and foreign currency impacts. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Fourth quarter 2022 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 12% to $941 million, compared with $843 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in instruments and accessories revenue was primarily driven by approximately 18% growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by customer buying patterns and foreign currency impacts.Fourth quarter 2022 systems revenue decreased by 4% to $451 million, compared with $470 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company placed 369 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with 385 systems in the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter 2022 system placements included 154 systems placed under operating lease and usage-based arrangements, compared with 143 systems in the fourth quarter of 2021.Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP income from operations decreased to $373 million, compared with $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.

During the first half of 2022, the Company saw COVID-19 resurgences impact da Vinci procedure volumes in the U.S. and Europe followed by recoveries.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.*About Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: constant currency revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (“EPS”), and non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding items such as amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation (“SBC”) and long-term incentive plan expenses, and other special items. Long-term incentive plan expense relates to phantom share awards granted in China by the Company’s Intuitive-Fosun joint venture to its employees that vest over four years and can remain outstanding for seven to ten years. These awards are valued based on certain key performance metrics. Accordingly, they are subject to significant volatility based on the performance of these metrics and are not tied to performance of the Company’s business within the period. The Company presents constant currency revenue to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to its historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company’s business.Constant currency revenue growth. The Company calculates constant currency revenue by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the increase in the current period constant currency revenue over the prior period revenue. Fourth quarter 2022 as reported revenue increased 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 3% unfavorable impact on fourth quarter 2022 revenue. Fourth quarter 2022 constant currency revenue increased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.Non-GAAP gross profit. The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets and SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses.Non-GAAP income from operations. The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, and a gain on the sale of a business.Non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and EPS. The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, a gain on the sale of a business, gains (losses) on strategic investments, adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture, net of the related tax effects, and tax adjustments, including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements as well as the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers, because the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company’s operating results. The Company’s calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. divided by non-GAAP diluted shares, which are calculated as GAAP weighted-average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS together with net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. calculated in accordance with GAAP.INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.

The Company made these changes to its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures based on its understanding of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) current views on this practice from knowledge of communications between the SEC and a number of pharmaceutical and life sciences companies and independent registered public accounting firms.

271,f8482053-a30c-34ac-99fe-ad01d7783926,WRK,2023-01-25,WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 88% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/westrock-company-nyse-wrk-favoured-124754940.html,1674564474,STORY,['WRK'],"[A look at the shareholders of WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about WestRock. View our latest analysis for WestRock ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About WestRock?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that WestRock does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at WestRock's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. WestRock is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.1% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of WestRockThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in WestRock Company. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$111m. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in WestRock. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  WestRock is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

LYV, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. MSGE.Industry: Leisure &amp; Recreation ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2042547/3-stocks-to-buy-from-leisure-recreation-services-industryThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is benefiting from the optimization of business processes, consistent strategic partnerships and digital initiatives. Robust demand for concerts and improving bookings for cruise operators are aiding the industry. Industry players like Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. are likely to gain in their respective fields owing to the factors mentioned above. However, the industry has been bearing the brunt of high costs and the slow U.S. economy.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry comprises a wide range of recreation providers, such as cruise, entertainment and media owners, golf-related leisure and entertainment venue business, theme park makers, resort operators and event organizers. Some industry players have ski and sports businesses, while some operate health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts.Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few of the industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, which is highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and growing disposable income.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Leisure &amp; Recreation Services IndustryCruise Operators Recovery Continues: The cruise industry has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, cruise operators are slowly recovering, backed by the resumption of services. Strong demand for cruising, acceleration in booking volumes and relaxation in COVID-related protocols bode well for cruise operators.Story continuesThe closure of cruise operations in China is hurting the industry. The cruise operators' operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, most cruise operators have decided to withdraw all activity in Russia.Theme Park Operators &amp; Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back: The theme park industry, which was rattled by the coronavirus pandemic, has been benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks has been rising. Live entertainment firms have been benefiting from pent-up demand for live events and robust ticket sales.Concerns of Slowing U.S. Economy: A slowdown in the economy is likely to hurt the industry. Apprehensions about a global slowdown and a possible recession loom over the stock market. Inflation in the United States remains the biggest challenge for the economy. The Fed hinted that it would slow down the pace of the interest rate rise with more evidence of easing inflation. However, it continues to support increasing interest rates in 2023.The consumer price index (CPI) for December 2022 came in at 5.7% after record highs of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. Yet, the numbers are far from the Federal Reserve's ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy. Inflationary cost increases in labor, compensation, healthcare, freight and rent are leading to higher expenses.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #70, which places it in the bottom 28% of 251 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in the group's earnings growth potential. Since Nov 30, 2022, the industry's loss estimates for the current year have narrowed by 1.2%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can take a look at, let's analyze the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past year.

Price and EPS Surprise Teradyne, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTeradyne, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Teradyne, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter, Teradyne is expected to have continued facing sluggishness in the Semiconductor Test business due to weak test demand than the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, the test demand is expected to have improved sequentially with rising automotive test demand.

Solid momentum in analog industrial is likely to have been another positive.Coming to the Industrial Automation business, softness in the industrial demand, labour scarcity in the distribution channel and foreign exchange headwinds are expected to have been major overhangs.Nevertheless, well-performing Universal Robots and Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR) are expected to have benefited the business in the quarter under review.Strengthening demand for Universal Robots’ UR20 and its solid momentum in the OEM channel are likely to have been positives.MiR’s robust services and spares, along with growing momentum across large customers, are likely to have contributed well.However, weakness in Teradyne’s Wireless Test business is expected to have impacted its quarterly performance negatively.

289,9c6607d2-f276-31fc-a237-6a1137ed8127,NWSA,2023-01-25,Rupert Murdoch has decided against reuniting his two media firms that he split up 10 years ago,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-decided-against-reuniting-092700771.html,1674638820,STORY,"['TROW', 'FOXA', 'NWSA', 'DIS']","[Media baron Rupert Murdoch abandoned his plans to merge Fox Corp and News Corp, the two media companies he controls.Both companies said their board of directors received letters from Murdoch “withdrawing the proposal to explore a potential combination of News Corp and Fox Corporation.” Together with his eldest son Lachlan, Murdoch determined that combining the two entities “is not optimal for shareholders” of either company at this time.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureFox operates news channels Fox News, Fox Sports, and Fox TV Stations. News Corp is the parent of publications such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and publisher HarperCollins. The Murdoch family owns about 40% of both companies. The Special Committees set up at both firms to explore the potential merger have been dissolved.Investors rejoice over the scrapped Fox-News Corp dealMurdoch had pursued a merger as a way to secure a bigger resource pool for further acquisitions, but investors saw little merit in overcomplicating a swelling business instead of simplifying it.They welcomed Murdoch’s change of heart. “This is the right decision,” said Adam Katz, co-founder and chief investment officer at activist investor Irenic, which owns 2.6% of the class B voting shares of News Corp.When the talks started, Irenic was among the first companies to object to a merger, suggesting that a spin-off of News Corp’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones was a better option.Soon after, Independent Franchise Partners, a bigger investor that owns 7% of News Corp’s Class A shares and 6.4% in Fox Corp, also pushed back on the deal in November. Then, T. Rowe Price, which owns almost 18% of News Corp, joined the growing chorus opposing the deal.“It’s more constructive to help form the process than try to push back against any proposal once it’s been made,” Vincent DeAugustino, one of the portfolio managers who oversees T. Rowe’s investment in News Corp, said at the time.Story continuesQuotable: Thumbs down for Fox-News Corp merger“Every investor I’ve spoken to in the last 10 years on News Corp has expressed that they think the company is way too complicated and should be simplified by selling assets or spinning off assets. Putting the two (News Corp and Fox) together makes no sense to us.” —Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research Partners.A brief history of the Fox and News Corp split and possible reunionJune 2013: Murdoch splits his $75 billion (at the time) News Corp into two—one is the loss-making publishing arm that retains the name, and the other is the more profitable Hollywood studio 21st Century Fox.March 2019: Murdoch sells 21st Century Fox to Disney for over $71 billion. The deal included movie production arms 20th Century, TV studios, a range of Fox’s cable channels, its 30% share of Hulu streaming, and more. Fox retained its news channel, sports channel, and a handful of others.October 2022: Murdoch writes letters to the boards at Fox and News Corp, asking them to consider a merger. The reunited entity would be worth around $26 billion, putting it in the league of Warner Bros Discovery, albeit far behind behemoths like Disney and Comcast.Was the Fox-News Corp deal a veiled succession planning attempt?When talk of the merger started, rumours swirled about 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan. But the company issued a staunch rebuttal.“The proposal is 100% based on business rationale.

307,0b7e6ac3-bfe2-3f7e-87bb-95d499f78d33,SWK,2023-01-25,Bumble and Stanley Black & Decker have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bumble-stanley-black-decker-highlighted-133801891.html,1674567481,STORY,"['SWK', 'BMBL', 'FCX', 'NUE', 'STLD']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 24, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Bumble Inc. BMBL as the Bull of the Day and Stanley Black &amp; Decker SWK as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Freeport McMoRan FCX, Nucor Corporation NUE and Steel Dynamics STLD.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Bumble Inc. is expected to see double digit revenue growth this year and next as people are still turning to the dating apps. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) had a big earnings beat in Q3 2022.Bumble is the parent company of Bumble, Badoo, and Fruitz. Bumble was founded in 2014 and is one of the first dating apps built with women at the center. It connects users through Bumble Date, Bumble BFF, for those looking for friendship, as well as Bumble Bizz, the professional networking segment.Badoo was founded in 2006 and is one of the pioneers of web and mobile dating products. Fruitz was founded in 2017 and uses fruit metaphors to encourage open and honest communications during dating.A Big Beat in the Third QuarterOn Nov 9, 2022, Bumble reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by $0.14. Earnings were $0.14 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.00.It was the third meet or beat in a row.Revenue rose 16.8% to $232.6 million up from $199.1 million a year ago driven by a 27.9% gain in Bumble App Revenue.Badoo App and Other Revenue was not as bullish, as it declined 10.2% to $52 million.Total paying users rose to 3.3 million from 2.9 million with total average revenue per paying User ""ARPPU"" rose to $22.96 from $22.81.Fourth Quarter GuidanceBumble gave fourth quarter guidance on revenue of a range of $232 million to $237 million. It does expect to see a $5 million impact to Badoo App and Other Revenue due to the Ukraine War.Analysts Get Bullish about 2023Bumble won't report earnings again until March 2023. Meanwhile, analysts are getting bullish with 1 estimate raised for 2022 and 2023 within the last week.Story continuesThe 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen to $0.23 from $0.11 in the last 90 days. That's moving in the right direction but it's still down 86.6% from 2022, where the company earned $1.72.Online dating apps, and all apps, in general, saw surging use during the pandemic which has started to wind down as the economy slows and consumers tighten spending.But one estimate is also higher in the last week for 2023. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $0.19 in 2023, which is still down 18% from 2022, but it appears that the analysts were a little too pessimistic.Shares Rally in the Last MonthBumble shares fell 18.9% in the last year, and are well off their 2021 IPO highs.Yet the shares have staged a nice rally in the last month, adding 15.7%.You aren't getting the shares on sale on a P/E basis, however, as they trade with a forward P/E of 126.4.The Street might have been too pessimistic about Bumble in 2022. If you're looking for an online dating app company where the analysts are raising earnings estimates, then Bumble might be one for the short list.Bear of the Day:Stanley Black &amp; Decker is in the midst of a business transformation while it also has to fight inflationary pressures and the challenging macroeconomic environment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings fall for the second year in a row in 2023.Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the world's largest tool company with nearly 50 manufacturing facilities in the United States and more than 100 worldwide.It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners and other industrial equipment. It's iconic brands include DEWALT, BLACK+DECKER, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY, CUB CADET, HUSTLER AND TROY-BILT.Earnings Estimates for 2022 and 2023 Continue to FallStanley Black &amp; Decker will report fourth quarter and full year results on Feb 2, 2023. What will it guide for 2023?Last quarter, on Oct 27, 2022, it lowered its full year guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.65 from $5.00 to $6.00. As you might assume, analysts lowered their estimates accordingly.But they have continued to cut.1 estimate has been cut for 2022 in the last 30 days. 2022 earnings are now expected to fall 57.6% from last year to $4.44, down from $10.48.Analysts are also still bearish on 2023. 2 estimates have been lowered over the last 30 days. Earnings are expected to fall another 5.8% to $4.18. That's down from $6.71 just 3 months ago.It's because of these earnings estimates cuts that the stock has fallen to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The cuts are bearish.Shares Plunge Below the COVID LowsShares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker have fallen 51% over the last year but even more devastating to long-term investors, the shares are now down 48% over the last 5 years as well.Yes, the shares have gotten a bid to start 2023, rising 20.7% over the last month but they aren't cheap, with a forward P/E of 20.5.The good news is that it is still shareholder friendly, paying both a dividend, which it raised for the 55th consecutive year again last year, and doing a share buy back. The dividend is yielding 3.7%.But there is a lot of uncertainty heading into this earnings report. Investors might want to wait on the sidelines to see what the outlook is for 2023.Additional content:3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Before Earnings This WeekMany stocks in the Basic Materials sector outperformed the broader market over the last year and provided a much-needed hedge against inflation.Let's take a look at three highly ranked Basic Material stocks set to report earnings this week that investors may want to consider buying in 2023 as well.Freeport McMoRanStarting the list is mineral exploration and development miner Freeport McMoRan.Freeport is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on January 25, with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Freeport McMoRan conducts its operations primarily through its principal subsidiaries' PT Freeport Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Corporation, and Atlantic Copper. It is important to note that PT Freeport Indonesia's principal asset Papua, is an Indonesia-based mine that contains the world's largest copper and gold reserves.With copper prices hitting their highest levels in the last six months on the London Metal Exchange, Freeport McMoRan stock is sticking out with earnings estimate revisions trending higher for fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22 with its Q4 report.Q4 Preview:The rise in copper prices, primarily attributed to the reopening of China, which is the world's largest copper consumer, is great timing as Freeport McMoRan earnings are expected to have dipped year over year during Q4 after a tough prior-year quarter to follow.Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to dip -58% to $0.40 a share compared to $0.96 a share in Q4 2021. On the top line, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, a -13% decrease from the prior year quarter. Still, an earnings beat on the company's bottom line is not completely out of the picture.Earnings ESP:The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction is a useful tool in indicating which stocks could top quarterly earnings estimates by comparing the Zacks Consensus to the Most Accurate Consensus.With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport McMoRan's Q4 earnings at $0.40 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.42 per share, FCX is expected to beat expectations by 6.96%.Takeaway:Certainly, a strong earnings beat on Freeport McMoRan's bottom line could lead to more upside in the stock. This could be supported by the company potentially offering better-than-expected guidance in correlation with higher copper prices.Nucor Corporation Steel Producer and metal recycler Nucor is another stock investors may want to consider buying ahead of its Q4 earnings on January 26. Nucor stock sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions notably rising for fiscal 2023.Even better, Nucor stock has been one of the top performers out of the basic materials sector over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and is already up 15% to start 2023.Q4 Preview:Following an excellent prior-year quarter, earnings are forecasted at $4.18 per share for Nucor's fourth quarter compared to $7.97 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected at $7.91 billion which would be a -23% YoY decline.However, with iron and steel prices remaining higher despite cooling off recently, it is quite possible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for a fifth consecutive quarter.Earnings ESP: Nucor stock has an ESP of 3.29% as the Zacks Consensus for Q4 earnings is $4.18 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.32 per share indicating the company could beat on its bottom line.Takeaway:Despite the year-over-year quarterly drop in earnings, Nucor stock trades at just 11.8X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 41.4X and a 23% discount to the median of 15.3X.Nucor's valuation appears to already support the likelihood that the company's earnings could decrease as steel prices move lower which still makes the stock attractive at its current levels with earnings estimates going up.Steel DynamicsRounding out the list is Steel Dynamics, which is set to report its Q4 earnings on January 25. Also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Steel Dynamics FY23 earnings estimates have gone up 36% over the last 60 days to $10.82 per share compared to estimates of $7.94 a share two months ago.Steel Dynamics is also a leading steel producer and recycler of metal in the United States and one of the most diversified steel companies in the U.S. with a vast range of specialty products.The performance of Steel Dynamics stock has been incredible over the last year, up +106%, standing out among stocks across any sector.Q4 Preview:Like Nucor, Steel Dynamics follows a stellar prior year fourth quarter. Steel Dynamics Q4 earnings are anticipated at $3.60 per share compared to $5.98 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected to be $4.73 billion and down -11% YoY.Still, it is quite plausible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for what would be a 13th consecutive quarter dating back to January of 2020.Earnings ESP:The Zacks ESP for Steel Dynamics indicates the company could once again beat on its bottom line. With the Zacks Consensus for Nucor's Q4 earnings at $3.60 a share, the most accurate estimate of $3.77 per share indicates the possibility of a 4.82% earnings beat.Takeaway:The top and bottom line growth for Steel Dynamics has been massive over the last few years as steel prices soared, and it is noteworthy that the company has also beaten sales expectations for 12 consecutive quarters.Steel Dynamics also trades attractively relative to its past at just 9.9X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 24.2X and the median of 12.2X.With its valuation also supporting the potential drop in steel prices, Steel Dynamics stock could have more upside especially if the company continues its stellar track record of topping quarterly expectations.Bottom Line After the very impressive top and bottom line growth these basic material stocks had in recent years, investors will definitely want to pay attention to their Q4 earnings. The rising earnings estimate revisions make the possibility of beating Q4 expectations quite plausible for Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, and Steel Dynamic stock and could continue supporting their strong performances.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

In an opinion piece in the New York Times on Monday, Lieu argued that systems such as facial recognition used by law enforcement agencies possibly can misidentify innocent people from minority groups.Huang said engineering standards bodies would need to establish standards for building safe AI systems, similar to how medical bodies set rules for the safe practice of medicine. But he also said laws and social norms would play a key role for AI.""What is the social norm for using it? What the legal norms (are) for using it have to be developed,"" Huang said. ""Everything is evolving right now. The fact that we're all talking about it puts us in a much better place to eventually end up at a good place.""(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; writing by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Stephen Coates)]"
310,3e7c9f40-1fb2-38e9-befc-01fd78df2b81,NVDA,2023-01-25,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Alphabet, NVIDIA, Microsoft and Meta Platforms",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-apple-144002964.html,1674571202,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'META']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 24, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple, Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Meta Platforms, Inc. META.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Investors Betting on Tech AgainWhile some continue to vacillate on the correct strategy for 2023, others figure that this is enough of a dip to get back into growth (mainly tech) stocks that will be driving our future. That's why the tech universe is seeing funds pouring in, with Netflix advancing 8.46%, NVIDIA 6.41%, Alphabet 5.34%, Baidu 5.91%, Qualcomm 4.52%, Snap 3.85%, Amazon 3.81% (included by virtue of AWS), Micron 3.73%, Microsoft 3.57%, AMD 3.49%, Paypal 3.05%, Taiwan Semiconductor 2.98%, Intel 2.81%, Meta 2.37%, Apple 1.92%, etc.One thing that's playing into this renewed enthusiasm for tech is the fact that it has completed a year of difficult comps, so growth rates are bound to pick up. The tech sector had a couple of years of tremendous strength during the pandemic when both consumers and corporates were racing to equip themselves for remote operation. Therefore, many pulled forward their tech investment plans. 2022 was always expected to be slow in comparison to the prior year. Now that we are in 2023, growth should return. Or at least that is the expectation.The second thing that makes tech attractive is the decision to trim the workforce. Through 2022, we were seeing massive layoffs at most technology companies. And unlike other sectors where labor is extremely tight, the technology sector had over-hired during the pandemic. Therefore, it was relatively easier to let some people go. As business picks up this year, they can hire back depending on their needs without the concern that talent will not be available. The government is also encouraging foreign tech workers, which will add to the pool of available talent.Story continuesThe third reason that tech is attractive is related to the economy. In general, when companies exit a recession/soft patch, they try to invest more in tech so that they can get more out of their existing infrastructure. And any new infrastructure always involves a larger spend on technology to make it more efficient. Therefore, as interest rates stabilize (as market experts expect them to this year), companies will get back to investment, which will spur growth for tech companies.A look at the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sector is also indicative. The 2023 estimate has dropped 29.3% over the past year as analysts made adjustments for a softer operating climate, which is a positive because the bad news is priced in. However, what's worth noting is that this estimate represents a 21.9% increase from 2022. Therefore, growth is clearly indicated, which is a good reason to be optimistic on the sector.Most of the big technology stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Let's take a look at some examples to see what our earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) methodology has to say about them.Apple, Inc.Apple has a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report on Feb 2. The ESP, (which is the difference between the most recent estimate and the consensus, thus capturing the latest factors affecting the company), is +4.42%. When a stock with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a positive ESP, our data shows that there's a good chance that it will beat estimates.Our data from the last five quarters shows that Apple usually beats estimates and there is usually a positive correlation with prices. Therefore, it would be advantageous to buy Apple shares right now.Alphabet Inc.Zacks #3 ranked Alphabet has an ESP of -4.85%. Therefore, it isn't clear whether it will beat estimates when it reports on Feb 2. Here, too, there is positive correlation with prices, which means that another negative surprise will lead to a decline in share prices. So its best to avoid these shares for now.NVIDIA Corp.NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Therefore, even though ESP is 0, we are unable to predict a positive earnings surprise when it reports on Feb 15. Since there's also low correlation with prices, it's hard to tell how investors will react to the news. Therefore, there's risk in buying these shares now.Microsoft Corp.Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 and its ESP is 0.34%. Therefore, there's a good chance of a positive surprise when it reports tomorrow, Jan. 24. Positive correlation between the earnings surprise and the price reaction is low, so there may not be a positive reaction to an earnings beat. If the magnitude of surprise is substantial, there will be a positive reaction from investors. Therefore, there's a fair chance of making some gains if you invest in Microsoft now.Meta Platforms, Inc.The #3 rank and ESP of 6.88% increases our confidence in Meta's chances of beating estimates when it reports on Feb 1. Since there is also a positive correlation between the surprise and prices, this could be a good stock to pick up heading into the earnings announcement.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

311,ebc6b531-c4c8-3daa-af3d-24fe490a9777,NVDA,2023-01-25,Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-buy-wall-street-143002751.html,1674570602,STORY,['NVDA'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nvidia here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in NVDA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0% over the past month to $3.26.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.07% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.31%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.22%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the prescription drug distributor had lost 2.25% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's loss of 0.32% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.64% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from McKesson as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 1, 2023. On that day, McKesson is projected to report earnings of $6.34 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.09%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $70.48 billion, up 2.72% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $24.78 per share and revenue of $275.58 billion, which would represent changes of +4.6% and +4.4%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for McKesson. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. McKesson is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, McKesson is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 15.14. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.48.We can also see that MCK currently has a PEG ratio of 1.5. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MCK's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.23 as of yesterday's close.The Medical - Dental Supplies industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 79, putting it in the top 32% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

314,6e085ac8-f2e6-3a39-9380-4a44fe70a8c8,MCK,2023-01-25,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-report-q4-165004260.html,1674579004,STORY,"['DGX', 'CAH', 'LH', 'MCK']","[Quest Diagnostics Incorporated DGX is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 2, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.36 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.8%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 5.81%.Factors at PlayQuest Diagnostics is likely to have benefited from the continued sales rebound in the non-COVID base business as economic activities return to pre-pandemic levels.In the past few months, the company accelerated growth through health plan access. During the third quarter, the company also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. The company continues to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements and sees increased volumes and pricing from the contracts. We expect these efforts to have contributed to Quest Diagnostics’ fourth-quarter revenues.In November 2022, Quest Diagnostics acquired select assets of LabCare Plus — the outreach laboratory services business of Summa Health — a large integrated health system. With the buyout, the company expands access to diagnostic advancement and insights, empowering better health for more communities in Northeastern Ohio. In the same month, Quest Diagnostics unveiled three new fitness panels on questhealth.com, intended for athletes of every kind, from weekend warriors to gold medalists. The new tests offer precise fitness insights and guidance to tangibly enhance performance and help them minimize their vulnerability to injury. These developments might have partially contributed to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseQuest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Apart from this, during the third quarter, the company made investments to strengthen its capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. In the last reported quarter, Quest Diagnostics launched a new e-commerce platform. The company launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of its consumer-initiated testing offerings, which cover everything from women’s health tests to allergy testing and sexually transmitted infections. These launches are expected to have contributed to the company’s Q4 revenues.Story continuesHowever, the base business is likely to have been impacted by Hurricane Ian and continued inflationary headwinds. To offset the inflationary pressure, Quest Diagnostics has been making several investments to strengthen advanced diagnostics capabilities within the base business and continued to pursue its operational excellence strategy. It has been been closely managing the cost structure through its Invigorate initiatives.In the to-be-reported quarter, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to have declined year over year, thanks to a robust year-ago comparison. However, on a positive note, as per December 2022 media statement, the company noted that COVID-19 testing volume increased throughout November. To improve testing access amid an increase in COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, Quest Diagnostics recently announced that symptomatic individuals may self-collect a nasal specimen for combined COVID-19-influenza molecular testing through approximately 1,600 of our patient service centers in the United States. In addition, Quest continues to partner with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services in the CDC Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) uninsured testing program. The program offers COVID-19 molecular testing through a patient service center network in areas with underserved populations (as defined by the CDC social vulnerability index). This might have provided a favorable boost to the company’s testing sales growth in Q4.Q4 EstimatesFor fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.25 billion, indicating an 18% decline from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.89, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 43.2%.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chance of beating estimates.

After the open today, we’ll get January numbers for S&amp;P PMI Manufacturing and Services. Both are expected to come in below the 50 level, which is the inflection point between positive and negative growth. Q4 GDP, Jobless Claims and a new PCE report all come out Thursday or Friday this week.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates decisively on its bottom line to $2.35 per share in its Q4, from $2.22 expected, for a nearly +6% earnings surprise. Revenues were a hair light of expectations at $23.71 billion in the quarter. J&amp;J is a company that, simply, does not miss on earnings — going back far longer than a decade.

324,9c6607d2-f276-31fc-a237-6a1137ed8127,FOX,2023-01-25,Rupert Murdoch has decided against reuniting his two media firms that he split up 10 years ago,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-decided-against-reuniting-092700771.html,1674638820,STORY,"['TROW', 'FOXA', 'NWSA', 'DIS']","[Media baron Rupert Murdoch abandoned his plans to merge Fox Corp and News Corp, the two media companies he controls.Both companies said their board of directors received letters from Murdoch “withdrawing the proposal to explore a potential combination of News Corp and Fox Corporation.” Together with his eldest son Lachlan, Murdoch determined that combining the two entities “is not optimal for shareholders” of either company at this time.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureFox operates news channels Fox News, Fox Sports, and Fox TV Stations. News Corp is the parent of publications such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and publisher HarperCollins. The Murdoch family owns about 40% of both companies. The Special Committees set up at both firms to explore the potential merger have been dissolved.Investors rejoice over the scrapped Fox-News Corp dealMurdoch had pursued a merger as a way to secure a bigger resource pool for further acquisitions, but investors saw little merit in overcomplicating a swelling business instead of simplifying it.They welcomed Murdoch’s change of heart. “This is the right decision,” said Adam Katz, co-founder and chief investment officer at activist investor Irenic, which owns 2.6% of the class B voting shares of News Corp.When the talks started, Irenic was among the first companies to object to a merger, suggesting that a spin-off of News Corp’s digital real estate business or Dow Jones was a better option.Soon after, Independent Franchise Partners, a bigger investor that owns 7% of News Corp’s Class A shares and 6.4% in Fox Corp, also pushed back on the deal in November. Then, T. Rowe Price, which owns almost 18% of News Corp, joined the growing chorus opposing the deal.“It’s more constructive to help form the process than try to push back against any proposal once it’s been made,” Vincent DeAugustino, one of the portfolio managers who oversees T. Rowe’s investment in News Corp, said at the time.Story continuesQuotable: Thumbs down for Fox-News Corp merger“Every investor I’ve spoken to in the last 10 years on News Corp has expressed that they think the company is way too complicated and should be simplified by selling assets or spinning off assets. Putting the two (News Corp and Fox) together makes no sense to us.” —Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research Partners.A brief history of the Fox and News Corp split and possible reunionJune 2013: Murdoch splits his $75 billion (at the time) News Corp into two—one is the loss-making publishing arm that retains the name, and the other is the more profitable Hollywood studio 21st Century Fox.March 2019: Murdoch sells 21st Century Fox to Disney for over $71 billion. The deal included movie production arms 20th Century, TV studios, a range of Fox’s cable channels, its 30% share of Hulu streaming, and more. Fox retained its news channel, sports channel, and a handful of others.October 2022: Murdoch writes letters to the boards at Fox and News Corp, asking them to consider a merger. The reunited entity would be worth around $26 billion, putting it in the league of Warner Bros Discovery, albeit far behind behemoths like Disney and Comcast.Was the Fox-News Corp deal a veiled succession planning attempt?When talk of the merger started, rumours swirled about 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan. But the company issued a staunch rebuttal.“The proposal is 100% based on business rationale. Any commentary that implies it has to do with succession planning is absurd and comes from sources with no knowledge of the strategy,” a spokesman for Murdoch told Reuters in November.Related stories🏠 Rupert Murdoch is officially a remote worker now💰 Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox because even his media giant was too small to compete🎬 Everything Disney’s takeover of Fox means for the future of entertainmentMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Let's kick it off with Microsoft. You're looking at gains of just about 4% here after-hours, the company beating expectations when it comes to adjusted EPS, $2.32. The estimate was for $2.30. Revenue just a bit light there, 52.75 billion. The estimate was for 52.93 billion.But the cloud business growth there, that's what's really driving the stock here after-hours. Intelligent Cloud revenue beating the Street's expectation, 21.51 billion. And that's growth of about 18%, growth of 24% in constant currency. Again, you're looking at the stock pop here, up about 4% after-hours. And competitor Amazon, AWS, the cloud number there boosting Amazon's stock after-hours, looking at Amazon's gains of just about 3%.Let's take a look at Capital One, that stock under pressure here following its earnings report, off just over 1 and 1/2%. Their fourth quarter EPS missed the Street's expectations, coming in just about $1 below at $2.82. The estimate was for $3.79. Revenue, a slight beat there, just over 9 billion. Provisions for credit losses higher than what the Street was looking for here, 2.42 billion. The estimate was for $1.85 billion, really indicative of the broader economic environment and the downturn maybe that we could potentially see here over the coming months.Car delinquency and also auto delinquency, both of those numbers growth up about over on a year over year basis. We're looking at losses of just about 1 and 1/2%. Taking a look at Texas Instruments, that stock is now back in positive territory after-hours, up just about 2/10 of a percent. Sales, though, dropping for the first time since 2020. They also offered a pretty tepid forecast. Some of their expectations there at the lower end of Wall Street's range.Story continuesTaking a look at some of these numbers, revenue declining 3.4% year over year. But it was better than what the Street was looking for. They reported 4.67 billion. The estimate was for 4.61 billion. EPS, $2.13-- that was better than what the Street was looking for. Gains of just about 2/10 of a percent.Also keep a close eye on Fox and News Corp. We just brought you the news of Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his proposal here to explore a potential sale of these two businesses. You're seeing Fox up after-hours, up just about 1 and 1/2%.

News Corp currently has a market capitalization of about $11 billion, while Fox is valued at a shade over $17 billion.Story continuesMurdoch proposed reuniting his media empire last fall, arguing that together the publishing and entertainment companies he split apart in 2013 would give the combined company greater scale in news, live sports and information, sources said.Several people close to the Murdochs viewed the attempt to combine the media companies as driven by the 91-year-old Murdoch’s succession planning to consolidate power behind his son and Fox head Lachlan Murdoch, a notion the company described as ""absurd"" in November.Some of News Corp’s larger shareholders, including Independent Franchise Partners and T. Rowe Price balked at the idea.Rupert Murdoch and his family trust control about 40% of News Corp and Fox. Had a deal been reached, they would have abstained from voting their shares when each company sought shareholder approval for the merger, because of the potential conflict of interest. This made securing the backing of other major shareholders a prerequisite to the deal going through.'RIGHT DECISION'Activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which was among the first to say that the proposed reunion would likely undervalue News Corp, on Tuesday applauded the decision to not move forward.""This is the right decision,"" Irenic's chief investment officer Adam Katz said. ""Looking ahead, News Corp has an opportunity to create substantial value for its owners.""News Corp agreed to buy Move in 2014 for $950 million to diversify its digital real estate business which, at the time, was primarily in Australia.Since then, News Corp investors had been calling on the company to spin off its digital real estate assets. Irenic also publicly urged News Corp to sell its Dow Jones media properties.On a slide-deck presentation in November, Irenic estimated News Corp's 80% stake in Move was worth $1.4 billion on $2.47 per share.In a letter to News Corp employees on Tuesday, News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said: ""In my note to you in October, I said the Special Committee assessment would have no impact on our current operations; that was indeed the case, and remains so following today’s announcement.""

The power distribution hub contains the inverter, converter, and charger components in a compact package size.Combining the 2.8kW generator with the lithium-ion battery allows RV users to have the same amount of accessible power as a larger 5kW generator with fewer emissions and less noise or vibration. The smart system is also solar ready, accepting up to 500W of solar input.Cummins is dedicated to making it possible for RV users to enjoy more freedom on their adventures. The concept system combines the best aspects of lithium-ion and fixed-mount generator technology. The batteries provide silent operation, and the onboard generator ensures those batteries never deplete to zero charge.The system supports the company's aspiration for a world with net-zero emissions. The transition to a decarbonized future starts now, but it will take time for it to be fully realized. During this technology transition, Cummins is committed to providing a portfolio of power solutions to meet the evolving needs of the RV industry.Story continuesThe 2024 California Air Resource Board (CARB) Small off-road engine (SORE) compliant, hybrid concept is an important step that direction.To further solidify Cummins' commitment to the RV industry, the Power Systems segment has aligned a special group of cross functional experts focused entirely on delivering optimized auxiliary power solutions for recreational and commercial vehicles.Cummins is excited about this dynamic industry's future and will continue to make the strategic decisions that make people's lives better.Cummins Inc., Tuesday, January 24, 2023, Press release pictureCummins Corporate Office Building in Columbus, Indiana.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/736520/Cummins-Concept-System-Helps-RV-Users-Reduce-Emissions-and-Noise]"

Many of the same meme stocks that shot up overnight have also turned those gains into huge losses. For many investors, reliable, old-fashioned companies with consistent earnings and dividends are just the ticket for long-term gains, even if they're not the type to jump 50% or more in a single day.As with any investment, be sure to consult with your financial advisor and discuss your investment objectives and risk tolerance before you make any moves. Here's a look at some ""boring"" stocks that may put long-term dollars into your pocket.josefkubes / Shutterstock.com3M (MMM)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $120.65When it comes to so-called ""boring"" stocks, 3M has to be near the top of the list. The venerable maker of such household products as Scotch Tape and Post-It Notes certainly doesn't have the headline-making power of, say, electric vehicle maker Tesla or iPhone maker Apple. Yet, 3M has been a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1976, it has paid dividends to shareholders without interruption for more than 100 years, and it has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years. Currently, the stock's yield sits at an extraordinary 5.03%. Put it all together, and as boring as 3M may seem, stock credentials don't get much more blue-chip than that.Live Richer Podcast: How To Leverage Your InvestmentsKen Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (PSA)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $289.10Public Storage is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the world. This certainly doesn't sound like an exciting business. However, it's a great ""boring"" stock to own due to its consistency. Americans are nothing if not excellent consumers, and in many cases, all of that ""stuff"" becomes too much to store at home. The storage business is a resilient one and can thrive in nearly any type of economy. In recessions, people downsize and need a place to store their things, and in a booming economy, spending picks up and adds to the ""storage of stuff"" problem. Thus, analysts consider this type of business recession-resistant. Currently, the stock is paying an attractive 2.7% yield.Story continuesastudio / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (CAT)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $249.71Caterpillar is another staid member of the old-fashioned Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining 30 years ago in 1991. The average consumer may know that Caterpillar makes machinery like bulldozers, but the company is much more than that. In fact, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel-electric locomotives, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines, to the tune of a whopping $51 billion in revenues in 2021 alone, up 22% over 2020. With a solid dividend yield of 1.95% and a product line that should benefit from a global economic recovery, Caterpillar could be a ""boring"" stock to watch for the long run.ShutterstockAmerican Water Works (AWK)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $151.54When it comes to ""boring"" stocks, utilities are usually at the top of the list. Utilities provide the basic services that all Americans need, such as water and power, and they often aren't popular with consumers, as they issue bills every single month with charges that seem to consistently rise. From an investor's perspective, however, this is what makes utilities attractive to invest in. By providing services that all people need, utilities generate a predictable, consistent revenue stream. This may sound boring, but it puts money directly into investors' pockets.American Water Works is the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility company in America. The need for clean water will always be there, and in the event of water shortages, prices will go up, which benefits investors. The stock has been a long-term, consistent winner and it currently pays a dividend yield of 1.74%.Supannee_Hickman / Shutterstock.comChevron (CVX)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $180.90Unlike most stocks on this list, Chevron actually had two boom years in 2021 and 2022, rising 38.96% and 52.95%, respectively. These are big gains for a company that's traditionally valued for its stability and the size of its large dividend. However, analysts still have a consensus ""buy"" rating on the stock, and if you're looking for consistent income, Chevron's a good choice. Even with the rise of electric vehicles, demand for oil remains huge, and the company's cash flow sustains a hefty 3.17% current dividend, making Chevron a great source of equity income.Bonsales / Shutterstock.comDisney (DIS)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $103.48The Walt Disney Company may make a more exciting product to most people than companies like 3M or Caterpillar, but it's still considered a reliable, ""boring"" stock. Disney could be a stock to take a look at because it is on the cusp of some big changes - and it has also struggled mightily through the pandemic. In Nov. 2022, the Disney board of directors booted pandemic-era CEO Bob Chapek and restored his famed predecessor Bob Iger, who ran the company solidly for 15 years. With the stock down about 44% in 2022 alone, this may be a good time for long-term investors to take another look at one of the most beloved ""boring"" companies on Wall Street. Under Iger's leadership, shareholders will no doubt be looking for recoveries across all of Disney's popular consumer segments, from feature films and streaming to theme parks and cruise ships.ShutterstockNRG Energy (NRG)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $32.21NRG Energy is another utility, like American Water Works, that may sound boring but that could be a good choice for your portfolio. With a current yield at a whopping 4.51%, NRG Energy puts a lot of money in investors' pockets every year. But the power industry's leading company has a lot more going for it looking forward than looking back. Under the Biden administration, more federal money is being allocated to clean energy generation. NRG Energy may benefit from this global push, as the company has three renewable energy plants and is looking to take advantage of this fast-growing area. Even if the Democrats lose power in Washington in coming years, the move towards renewables looks set to continue on a global basis.rvolkan / iStock.comMicrosoft (MSFT)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $240.22Microsoft is another of a large gang of ""old tech"" stocks that in many circles just aren't as exciting anymore, with a new wave of companies like Salesforce.com, Shopify and Square gobbling both headlines and investor interest. Yet, Microsoft is much more than the ""boring"" old tech stock that only sells Windows software. Microsoft has been moving aggressively into cloud services in recent years, and its earnings are starting to reflect a much higher growth profile, including its venture software for electric vehicles. The company's CEO has recently announced some small layoffs and cautioned investors about a bumpy road for tech companies, but these announcements - and the vicious bear market of 2022 - have only served to give long-term investors an entry point on this long-term, ""boring"" winner. After dropping about 29% in 2022, the stock now yields 1.17%, not bad for a growth-oriented tech stock.ivanastar / Getty ImagesLowe's (LOW)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $204.53Lowe's is one of the two companies that dominate the home improvement space, along with Home Depot. Unless you're a contractor, there's nothing really exciting about a company that sells lights, screws, flooring, tools and construction supplies. However, the stock has been exciting indeed for investors, gaining about 95% over the past five years - and dropping ""only"" about 15% in 2022, in the midst of a significant bear market.Lowe's did well during the heart of the pandemic, posting a return of over 98% in 2020 alone as people stayed home and took on renovation projects. However, the long-term prospects of the company are good as well, as foot traffic continues to rise, and its installation services are generating additional revenue. Lowe's certainly has highs and lows as the housing market expands and contracts, but over the long-run, Americans enjoy being homeowners, and there will always be projects to work on. Lowe's also supports a current yield of 2.08%, offering a decent level of income on top of its growth potential.varandah / Shutterstock.comMastercard (MA)Stock price as of Jan. 20: $376.28The business of credit card processing may not seem all that exciting. But it sure can be profitable. With about 83% of Americans owning at least one credit card, a company like Mastercard has an entrenched customer base that is likely to continue spending. While short-term blips like the pandemic or a recession can temporarily slow consumer spending, history has shown that it always picks up and reaches new highs. Every time a customer swipes a Mastercard to pay for these purchases, Mastercard generates revenue. This makes Mastercard the poster child for ""boring"" stocks that can be important to own for your long-term portfolio. Even in 2022, during the midst of a fierce bear market, shares of Mastercard only fell just over 3%.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsDisclaimer: This list of stocks to consider was originally compiled on and is accurate as of January 20, 2023.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Boring Stocks That Are Important for Your Portfolio]"

F5 expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.All forward-looking non-GAAP measures included in the Company’s business outlook exclude estimates for amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations (including the impact of income tax reform), non-recurring income tax adjustments, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusions, and do not include the impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures, acquisition-related charges and write-downs, restructuring charges, facility exit costs, or other non-recurring charges that may occur in the period. F5 is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded.

Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of offerings; continued disruptions to the global supply chain resulting in inability to source required parts for F5’s products or the ability to only do so at greatly increased prices thereby impacting our revenues and/or margins; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; F5’s ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses’ products with F5 technologies; the ability of F5’s sales professionals and distribution partners to sell new solutions and service offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures, industry consolidation, entry of new competitors into F5’s markets, and new product and marketing initiatives by our competitors; increased sales discounts; the business impact of the acquisitions and potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement of completion of acquisitions; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; potential security flaws in the Company’s networks, products or services; cybersecurity attacks on its networks, products or services; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; F5’s ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5’s ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5’s ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5’s sales cycle; the ability of F5 to execute on its share repurchase program including the timing of any repurchases; future prices of F5’s common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and other documents that we may file or furnish from time to time, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations.

All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.GAAP to non-GAAP ReconciliationF5’s management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations, and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets, facility-exit costs, acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, restructuring charges, and certain non-recurring tax expenses and benefits, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the Company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the Company’s tax liability.The non-GAAP adjustments, and F5's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation consists of expense for stock options, restricted stock, and employee stock purchases through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of F5’s employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of the Company’s core business and to facilitate comparison of the Company’s results to those of peer companies.Amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. On a non-recurring basis, when certain events or circumstances are present, management may also be required to write down the carrying value of its purchased intangible assets and recognize impairment charges. Management does not believe these charges accurately reflect the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations; therefore, they are not considered by management in making operating decisions. However, investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to F5’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to F5’s future period revenues as well.Facility-exit costs. F5 has incurred charges in connection with the exit of facilities as well as other non-recurring lease activity. These charges are not representative of ongoing costs to the business and are not expected to recur. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.Acquisition-related charges, net. F5 does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms and scope of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction. F5 excludes acquisition-related charges from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies. Acquisition-related charges consist of planning, execution and integration costs incurred directly as a result of an acquisition.Restructuring charges. F5 has incurred restructuring charges that are included in its GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and costs associated with exiting facility-lease commitments. F5 excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the Company’s core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. Although F5’s management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management’s reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5’s earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5’s management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measures of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business and is used by management in its own evaluation of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the Company provides investors these supplemental measures since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the Company’s operational performance and financial results.For reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section in our attached Condensed Consolidated Income Statements entitled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures.""About F5F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure and optimize every app and API anywhere—on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

Net revenues reflected a $239 million, or 7%, positive impact from organic growth, a $70 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $7 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.Fourth quarter 2022 net revenues were $906 million, an increase of $21 million, or 2%, from $885 million in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a $41 million, or 5%, positive impact from organic growth, including positive contributions from all segments, partially offset by an $18 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $2 million decrease from the net impact of an acquisition and divestiture.Solutions businesses revenues were $652 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $21 million, or 3%. The increase reflects a $30 million, or 5%, positive impact from organic growth, and a $1 million increase from an acquisition, partially offset by a $10 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.Trading Services net revenues were $253 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $3 million, or 1%. The increase reflects an $11 million, or 4%, positive impact from organic growth, partially offset by an $8 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.2022 GAAP operating expenses were $2,018 million, an increase of $39 million, or 2% over 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP operating expenses increased $16 million, or 3%, versus the prior year period. The increases in both periods primarily reflect increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses, and higher travel costs. The increase in 2022 GAAP operating expenses are partially offset by lower regulatory and amortization expenses reflecting one-time charges in 2021 as well as lower restructuring charges for the year. The increase in fourth quarter 2022 GAAP operating expense includes higher merger and strategic initiatives expense and restructuring charges.2022 non-GAAP operating expenses were $1,721 million, an increase of $105 million or 6%, over 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $26 million, or 6% versus the prior year period. The increase in both periods primarily reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses, and higher travel costs, partially offset by lower marketing and advertising expense due to lower capital markets activity and changes in FX rates.The company repurchased $633 million in shares of its common stock during 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there was $650 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program, following an approval by the Board of Directors in December 2022 to increase the authorized amount of the share repurchase program.INITIATING 2023 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE5The company is initiating its 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1,770 to $1,850 million. Nasdaq expects its 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATESNasdaq implemented its new corporate structure during the fourth quarter of 2022 to amplify strategy. Nasdaq’s new corporate structure took effect during the fourth quarter of 2022 with business units organized into three divisions: Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms, and Anti-Financial Crime. The new structure aligns the company more closely with evolving client needs and global financial system. Nasdaq’s annualized SaaS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 13% year over year. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $725 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing 36% of total company ARR, up from 34% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The 13% year over year increase in annualized SaaS revenues primarily reflects strong growth in the fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions and Workflow and Insights businesses.

The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges for operating company IPOs with a 92% total win rate during 2022 and 100% win rate in the fourth quarter of 2022. During 2022, the Nasdaq Stock Market featured six of the largest ten U.S. IPOs by capital raised, attracted 74% of all proceeds raised through U.S. IPOs and welcomed 14 listing switches.

Nasdaq named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and received approval by The Science Based Targets Initiative for net-zero targets. Nasdaq received key recognitions by several third-party validators during 2022, including being named for the seventh consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Additionally, Nasdaq’s near and long-term science-based emissions reductions targets were approved by The Science Based Targets initiative.

This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.4 Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income and operating expenses, included in the attached schedules.5 U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.ABOUT NASDAQNasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a global technology company serving the capital markets and other industries.

In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance. Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release.Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.Divisional alignment program: In October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as “restructuring” in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTInformation set forth in this communication contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations.    (2) We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction.          (3) The 2022 charges relate to our divisional alignment program that was initiated in October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. The charges in 2019, 2020 and 2021 are associated with our restructuring program initiated in September 2019 with the goal of transitioning certain technology platforms to advance Nasdaq’s strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continuing our re-alignment of certain business areas. The 2019 program was completed as of June 30, 2021.          (4) For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $84 million on the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, which is included in net gain on divestiture of business in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.          (5) Represents the earnings and losses recognized from our equity interest in the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC. We will continue to exclude the earnings and losses related to our share of OCC's earnings for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as our income on this investment may vary significantly period to period. This provides a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.          (6) In December 2021, we recorded a $33 million charge related to a decision made by the Swedish Administrative court rejecting an appeal by Nasdaq Clearing to dismiss an administrative fine imposed by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, or SFSA, associated with the default of a member of the Nasdaq Clearing commodities market that occurred in 2018. Nasdaq Clearing has appealed the court’s recent decision and firmly believes in the merits of its appeal. The charge was recorded to regulatory expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.          (7) For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt. The charge for both periods is recorded in general, administrative and other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.          (8) We have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 and the three months and year ended December 31, 2021, other significant items included net gains and losses from strategic investments entered into through our corporate venture program recorded in other income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, other significant items also included accruals related to legal matters recorded in general, administrative and other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.          (9) The non-GAAP adjustment to the income tax provision primarily includes the tax impact of each non-GAAP adjustment. In addition, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a tax benefit related to state and local provision to return adjustments and a release of tax reserves due to statute of limitation expiration. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we also recorded a prior year tax benefit, net of reserve. Nasdaq, Inc.Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Net Income, Diluted Earnings Per Share, Operating Income and Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP Net Income, Diluted Earnings Per Share, Operating Income, and Operating Expenses(in millions)(unaudited)            Three Months Ended  Year Ended   December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31,    2022   2021   2022   2021           U.S. GAAP operating income $349  $344  $1,564  $1,441 Non-GAAP adjustments:         Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets (1)  38   54   153   170  Merger and strategic initiatives expense (2)  41   17   82   87  Restructuring charges (3)  15   —   15   31  Extinguishment of debt (4)  —   —   16   33  Regulatory matters (5)  1   33   1   33  Other (6)  2   3   30   9  Total non-GAAP adjustments  97   107   297   363 Non-GAAP operating income $446  $451  $1,861  $1,804          Revenues less transaction-based expenses  $906  $885  $3,582  $3,420           U.S. GAAP operating margin (7)  39%  39%  44%  42%          Non-GAAP operating margin (8)  49%  51%  52%  53%          (1) We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.6 billion, which indicates a rise of 3.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at 76 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 3.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has moved down by a penny in the past seven days.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter net sales to increase 0.7% year over year to $4,432.5 million and the bottom line to decline 3.9% to 76 cents per share. For 2022, we estimate year-over-year revenue growth of 2% to $17,770.5 million, with a year-over-year earnings decline of 7.8% to $2.96.In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 0.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.ColgatePalmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise ColgatePalmolive Company Price and EPS SurpriseColgatePalmolive Company price-eps-surprise | ColgatePalmolive Company QuoteKey Aspects to NoteThe leading global consumer products company is expected to have gained from consumer demand for personal care, hygiene and home care products. Colgate’s top line in the fourth quarter is likely to have benefited from innovation, brand strength and focus on premiumization and digital transformation. The company’s stringent pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Colgate has been focusing on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Its premium innovation products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well. This is expected to have boosted organic sales growth for its oral care business in the fourth quarter. We anticipate organic sales growth of 7.8% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for 2022.Colgate has been on track with its efforts to improve product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. The company has been aggressively expanding into faster growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands. Colgate has also been focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers have been using online services for their essential needs. Gains from the company’s expansion efforts are likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results.Colgate’s Hill's business has been witnessing momentum, which is expected to have delivered sales growth in the fourth quarter. Strength in Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet has been aiding sales for the segment. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share. This is expected to have boosted sales in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated net sales growth in the middle of previously mentioned 1-4% growth for 2022. This included a modest benefit from the Red Collar acquisition. Organic sales are expected to increase 6-7%. Advertising investments are expected to be nearly flat year over year (on a dollar basis) on both GAAP and adjusted basis for 2022. Advertising, as a percentage of net sales, is expected to be down slightly for 2022, driven by reductions in Europe.The company anticipated earnings growth in the double-digits on a GAAP basis for 2022. For the fourth quarter, it anticipates the production of pet food for Red Collar to add 200 bps to net sales and be neutral to earnings per share.However, higher raw material and logistic costs worldwide have been concerning despite sales growth. Each of the company’s segments has been incurring significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. Higher logistics costs have been resulting from volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry, higher e-commerce demand, and the impacts of the Ukraine war. These headwinds are likely to have continued to impact the fourth-quarter and 2022 performance.Moreover, the company has been witnessing a deleverage in advertising and SG&amp;A expenses, which have been weighing on margins. These costs and headwinds are likely to have hurt the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Although Colgate expected to witness reduced impacts of logistic-related headwinds on a sequential basis, it anticipated logistic costs to increase year over year in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, the company anticipates the production of pet food for Red Collar to have a 100-bps negative impact on the gross margin. Colgate expects a gross margin decline on both GAAP and adjusted basis for 2022.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Colgate this time around.

351,e0b74f34-08d3-3fa4-ba7e-34dbc6f1a476,JNPR,2023-01-25,Juniper Networks (JNPR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-jnpr-earnings-expected-150003276.html,1674572403,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Juniper Networks (JNPR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.48 billion, up 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Juniper?For Juniper, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Juniper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Juniper would post earnings of $0.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.58, delivering a surprise of +16%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Juniper appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Comcast’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Comcast What's The Opportunity In Comcast?Great news for investors – Comcast is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $59.79, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Comcast’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Comcast?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Comcast. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CMCSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CMCSA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CMCSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Comcast, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors to ConsiderCharter’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to reflect a sluggish Internet subscribers addition rate. In the last reported quarter, Charter had 30.3 million internet customers, up only 1.4% year over year. Charter gained 75K Internet customers in the last reported quarter, significantly down from the 265K it added in the third quarter of 2021.Charter’s fourth-quarter 2022 top line is expected to have been negatively impacted by increasing competition in the cable space. However, collaboration with companies like Comcast CMCSA and Apple TV+ is expected to have helped Charter’s prospects in the to-be-reported quarter.Charter has collaborated with Comcast to offer a streaming platform — Xumo — on various branded 4K streaming devices and smart TVs. Charter and Comcast have also rebranded Flex, the 4K streaming device Comcast licensed to the joint venture, as Xumo Stream Box, and XClass TV as Xumo TV.However, Charter is likely to have benefited from an expanding mobile user base, owing to its new Spectrum 1 offering.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

The initiative aims to help close the digital skill divide that is currently limiting educational and employment opportunities for nearly 50 million Americans.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230123005823/en/NSC received a $200,000 grant from Comcast to help state leaders bridge existing workforce development programs with federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) and Digital Equity Act (DEA) funding. Digital skills are now required across virtually every industry and occupation, yet nearly one in three U.S. workers lack the foundational digital skills necessary to enter and thrive in today’s workforce, with workers of color and those earning lower wages disproportionately affected. These programs represent a once-in-a-generation investment in closing the digital skills gap equitably.""If local, state, and federal decisionmakers fully understand its potential – and if workforce and broadband offices work together on its implementation – this federal investment in digital equity could have a profound impact on closing the digital skill divide for tens of millions of America’s workers,"" said Andy Van Kleunen, NSC CEO. ""We’re grateful to Comcast for their partnership in making that happen.""""When digital skills grow, our economy grows,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation.

This would also represent 7% year-over-year growth from Q4 2021 and round out IBM’s Fiscal 2022 earnings at $9.14 a share, a 15% increase from FY21.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are projected at $15.55 billion for Q4 which would be a -7% decrease from the prior year quarter but shows IBM is making the best of its operating environment. Total sales for FY22 would be $59.39 billion, a -16% YoY decrease with sales at $70.79 billion in 2021.Earnings ESP: As fore mentioned IBM is expected to top Q4 earnings expectations with an Expected Surprise Prediction of 1.90% as the Zacks Consensus is $3.60 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus is $3.67 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite the dip on the top line, IBM’s management seems to be effectively navigating the challenging operating environment as indicated in the company’s earnings. On that note, a Q4 earnings beat and better-than-expected guidance could lead to more upside in IBM stock which is very impressive considering the difficulties higher inflation has inflicted on most tech companies.Story continuesPlus, over the last two years, IBM is now up +19% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s +3% and the Nasdaq’s -17% as the company continues to diversify its business operations.United Rentals URI Another stock investors may want to consider buying this week is United Rentals (URI) which is set to report earnings on January 25. As the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals’ stock continues to look very intriguing.United Rentals’ customer base is loyal and includes construction, industrial, and utility companies that also include municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors, and homeowners among others.United Rentals currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimates trending higher for the company’s current fiscal 2022 and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: United Rentals looks poised to have another strong quarter on the bottom line. Fourth quarter earnings are expected to be up 36% YoY at $10.09 per share compared to $7.39 a share in Q4 2021.This would have United Rentals finishing Fiscal 2022 with earnings up a stellar 48% at $32.60 per share compared to $22.06 per share in 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Q4 sales are expected at $3.29 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter. More impressively United Rentals would post 20% top-line growth for FY22 rounding out the year with sales at $11.64 billion compared to $9.72 billion in 2021.Earnings ESP: After beating earnings expectations in four consecutive quarters the trend could continue with the Zacks Consensus for URI’s Q4 earnings at $10.09 per share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $10.22 a share. This indicates United Rentals could beat expectations by 1.31%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: The top and bottom line growth for United Rentals has been very impressive and the rising earnings estimate revisions going into Q4 earnings is a sign that URI’s stock could continue its stellar performance, up 26% over the last year and 662% over the last decade to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500.Bottom Line IBM and United Rentals are two companies that continue to outperform on their bottom lines and this could lead to more upside in these stocks. Their ability to effectively manage operating costs in a challenging economy and operating environment is very impressive and could separate IBM and URI stock from others in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

OESX announced preliminary results for third-quarter fiscal 2023 that reflected project delays and slower-than-expected activity. The company also lowered its revenue expectation for the full year.Orion’s shares declined 2.7% in the trading session and 4.5% in the after-hour trading session on Jan 23.The company's shares have plunged 40.4% compared with the Zacks Building Products-Lightning industry's decline of 28.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFiscal Q3 Preliminary ResultsOrion’s preliminary third-quarter results depict the impact of certain factors like continuous delays in the initiation of certain large customer projects along with slower project activity in its electrical contractor distribution channel. Owing to these factors, the company reported fiscal third-quarter revenuesof $20 million, reflecting a decrease of 34.9% from the year-ago period. That said, the quarterly revenues improved sequentially from $17.6 million.The preliminary quarterly revenues of the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.1 million.Fiscal third-quarter gross margin of 25% improved from 24.9% a year ago but contracted from 25.3% in the prior-reported quarter. Moreover, the company expects cash flow from operations to be positive in the quarter.At the end of the fiscal third quarter, the company’s liquidity was $19 million, including $8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $11 million in availability under its credit facility.Revised OutlookDepending on the current business environment, economic challenges and pandemic-related constraints the company has revised its 2023 financial outlook and initiated its fiscal year 2024 revenue growth rate expectation.For fourth-quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects revenues to improve sequentially. It expects the quarter to be the strongest quarter of fiscal 2023 and likely will exceed year-ago’s revenue of $22.1 million.Overall, Orion now expects fiscal 2023 revenues between $77 million and $80 million, lower than the earlier expectation of $90 million-$110 million. Delays in the activation of large Department of Defense (DoD) and automotive projects have pushed anticipated revenues from these projects into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.The automotive projects shifted start from the third-quarter to the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2023. The $9 million DoD project is expected to start from the first-quarter of fiscal 2024. Also, sales through the lighting distribution channel were slow due to a softening economic environment. This eventually shifts a significant amount of revenues to the last quarter of 2023 and fiscal 2024.Despite these challenges, the company expects the maintenance business, with its recurring revenues, and EV business to accelerate as they initiate cross-selling activities, drawing significant revenues in fiscal 2024. These factors will help revenues to grow in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.The revenue growth rate of fiscal year 2024 is expected to be 30%, which is comparatively more than fiscal 2023.Story continuesKey PicksOrion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Mettler-Toledo (MTD) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of precision instruments is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mettler-Toledo is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 8.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.9%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Mettler-Toledo has an S/TA ratio of 1.17, which means that the company gets $1.17 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.72, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Mettler-Toledo looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 1.7% this year versus the industry average of 0.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Mettler-Toledo have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Mettler-Toledo a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Mettler-Toledo is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Our findings show that many executives see decentralized finance, web3 infrastructure, digital assets and currencies as critical components of their long term strategy, both from a defensive and offensive perspective, to help lead the way into this next phase of the digital revolution.""U.S. Firms are Planning for Digital Assets and Next Generation InternetThe next generation of the Internet, referred to as Web3, centers around decentralized infrastructure like blockchain technology and includes innovations such as cryptocurrency, DeFi, and the metaverse.

Embedded payments are most familiar to consumers, enabling the speed and convenience of paying for goods and services in an app with just a single click. New use cases across banking, lending and investing are emerging and the drive to deliver embedded financial services is on the rise in the U.S.36% of financial services firms will invest significantly in developing embedded finance products within 12 months, according to the study.Meanwhile, 59% of non-financial firms that see an impact from embedded finance on their business told FIS they will respond by increasing their tech or research and development budget this year.ESG is Widely Seen as a Competitive Must-Have in the U.S.ESG is the systematic consideration of environmental, social and governance factors alongside financial factors when making decisions about investments, business practices, and commercial relationships. If supported by the right technology, ESG can open new growth opportunities and competitiveness in the U.S. market.56% financial services firms in the U.S. say ESG offers an opportunity to improve their competitiveness in the market.60% of financial services firms told FIS they are developing new products and services.To address difficulties in accessing and analyzing their own ESG data, 56% of financial services firms say they are investing in technology to improve reporting and disclosures, giving clients more transparency into ESG scores and/or providing more granular ESG ratings of assets and securities.MethodologyAll data is based on a survey of 2,000 executives from financial services firms (banks, insurers, capital markets firms and fintechs) and non-financial services businesses (merchants, corporates and technology providers) in nine countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada Germany, Hong Kong, India Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S.).

The report reveals that natural disasters caused a $313 billion global economic loss during the 12-month period under review - 4 percent above the 21st-century average - $132 billion of which was covered by insurance.Data show that 2022 was the fifth costliest year on record for insurers, with approximately $50-55 billion of the global insured loss total resulting from Hurricane Ian in the United States - the second-costliest natural catastrophe in history from an insurance perspective, surpassed only by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which resulted in nearly $100 billion in insured losses on a price-inflated basis.The report also highlights that approximately 31,300 people lost their lives due to global natural catastrophe events in 2022. The total number of fatalities remains below average for now 12 years in a row; however, more than 19,000 of the fatalities were heat-related deaths in Europe alone, primarily as a result of heatwaves.While a majority of total losses in 2022 were left uninsured, the 58 percent ""protection gap"" was one of the lowest on record, highlighting a positive shift in how businesses are navigating volatility through risk mitigation, and how insurers are providing further protection to underserved communities through access to capital.""This report explores the events and costs of catastrophes and natural disasters in 2022 that created a staggering amount of economic loss,"" said Greg Case, CEO of Aon. ""But this data also highlights a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to better serve clients. By working together on scalable solutions, we will not only mitigate risk, but bring together public, private and societal forces to accelerate innovation, protect underserved communities and strengthen the economy.""Story continuesWhile technological innovation has allowed for better insight as catastrophes unfold and faster and more thorough assessments of damages after an event, the Aon study examines resilience and the ability to overcome climate-related consequences – not only for physical risks, but in areas like the health of the workforce, reiterating the need to build multi-faceted strategies that account for climate change risk mitigation on all fronts.Further findings of the 2023 Weather, Climate and Catastrophe Insight report include:421 notable natural disaster events were recorded in 2022, higher than the 21st century average of 396.75 percent of global insured losses were recorded in the United States, which was higher than the average of 60 percent.Windstorm Eunice was the costliest individual European windstorm since 2010, with $3.4 billion in insured losses. Widespread hailstorms in France contributed to the second-highest natural disaster payouts for the country on record of €6.9 billion ($7.4 billion).Droughts and heatwaves severely impacted Europe, the United States, China and other regions and global insurance payouts for the drought peril were the second highest on record, at $12.6 billion globally.Flood losses in Australia broke the historical record as La Niña conditions persisted for a third year and Sydney recorded the highest annual rainfall.Monsoonal floods in Pakistan had a far-reaching humanitarian impact on the country. In a summary of the 2022 monsoon season, the Pakistan Meteorological Department noted that country-wide rainfall from July to September was 175 percent above average.Both severe drought conditions and a prolonged rainy season in different regions of Latin America reduced agricultural crop yield across the region.""The devastation that disasters caused around the world demonstrate the need for wider adoption of risk mitigation strategies, including better disaster management and warning systems that improve resilience,"" said Michal Lörinc, head of Catastrophe Insight at Aon. ""While impacts of climate change become increasingly visible around the world, it is the socioeconomic aspects, demographics and wealth distribution that remain a major driver of financial loss. Data in this report will help guide organizations to not only enhance their own risk mitigation but take action to close the protection gap globally to better protect the communities in which we live and work.""The top 10 global economic loss events in 2022 were:DateEventLocationDeathsEconomic Loss Insured Loss ($ billion)($ billion)09/27 – 10/01Hurricane IanUnited States, Cuba15795.552.5AnnualEuropean DroughtSouthern, Western &amp; Central EuropeN/A223AnnualU.S. DroughtUnited StatesN/A16806/14 – 10/30Pakistan Seasonal FloodsPakistan1,739150.106/01 – 09/30China Seasonal FloodsChina195150.403/16Fukushima EarthquakeJapan49.12.902/23 – 03/31QLD &amp; NSW FloodsAustralia2284AnnualChina DroughtChinaN/A7.60.202/18 – 02/19Windstorm EuniceWestern &amp; Central Europe174.53.405/17 – 10/31India Seasonal FloodsIndia2,1354.20.1All other events~27,100115.657.4TOTALS~31,300313 billion132 billion The full report and a short video are available on Aon's interactive microsite.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.9%.Revenues are expected to be $5.71 billion, down 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald's?For McDonald's, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McDonald's would post earnings of $2.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.68, delivering a surprise of +4.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McDonald's doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recently, the company executed a lease for 192,000 square feet in Northern New Jersey.This lease with a transportation and logistics services provider will start on Apr 1, 2023, and expire in November 2028. To facilitate this, an early termination agreement had been executed by TRNO with an existing tenant in the 192,000-square-foot space, effective Mar 31, 2023.The demand for industrial real estate space has been high amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies. Terreno Realty is also experiencing solid demand for its properties.As of Dec 31, 2022, TRNO’s operating portfolio, excluding one property under redevelopment, was 98.6% leased. This marks an expansion of 20 basis points (bps) sequentially and 310 bps year over year. The same-store portfolio (spanning 12.1 million square feet) was 99.5% leased at the end of the quarter, up 60 bps sequentially and 140 bps year over year.Moreover, the improved land portfolio of 46 parcels, excluding two parcels under redevelopment, aggregated roughly 161.4 acres. The same was 92.5% leased as of Dec 31, 2022, up 90 bps sequentially.Terreno Realty was able to lock in higher rents on new and renewed leases. These reflected solid industrial real estate market fundamentals and portfolio strength.For the fourth quarter of 2022, this industrial REIT witnessed a 45.2% increase in cash rents on new and renewed leases, with a tenant retention ratio of 80.6% for the operating portfolio and 0.0% for the improved land portfolio. For the full-year 2022, TRNO experienced a 49.5% increase in cash rents on new and renewed leases.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including Terreno Realty, Prologis PLD and First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Terreno Realty is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. During the October-December quarter, TRNO acquired four properties comprising three buildings, encompassing roughly 65,000 square feet, and one improved land parcel of roughly 2.8 acres for a total of $59.4 million.For the full-year 2022, Terreno Realty’s acquisition activity included 20 properties. These comprised 17 buildings encompassing roughly 831,000 square feet and 11 improved land parcels of about 35.7 acres for a total of $414.8 million.However, elevated supply in several markets, which is likely to fuel competition, and the stabilization of e-commerce sales growth raise concerns for Terreno Realty. Also, interest rate hikes add to the company’s woes.Shares of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) Terreno Realty have climbed 16.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 8.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrologis carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold) at present.

However, Cross does not expect a rebound until at least 1Q24, as inventory levels remain elevated.The analyst expects gross margin to decline 794 bps Y/Y to 22.8% on significant underutilization charges, albeit partially offset by a more excellent mix of higher capacity drives.Cross expects the operating margin to decline by 1,503 bps Y/Y to 4.9% and expects benefit from the restructuring plan (announced during 1Q23 earnings) starting in 3Q23.Therefore, Cross expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.04, below the consensus of $0.09.Also Read: Seagate Technology Poised For Early Cycle Rebound, Says Morgan Stanley AnalystCross expects total HDD unit shipments to decline 50% Y/Y, including Mass Capacity down 40% Y/Y and Legacy 60% Y/Y.The volume decrease is primarily attributable to customers reducing inventory levels after several quarters of aggressive buying and continued weakness in China.The analyst expects underutilization charges to significantly impact profitability as Seagate cuts production to manage its and customer inventory levels.For 2Q23, Cross estimates a 22.8% gross margin, improving to 23.6% by 4Q23 as inventory levels stabilize and higher capacity HAMR drives the move to commercialization.Price Action: STX shares traded lower by 1.15% at $62.50 on the last check Tuesday.Photo Via CompanyLatest Ratings for STXDateFirmActionFromToJan 2022BenchmarkMaintainsBuyJan 2022StifelMaintainsBuyJan 2022Deutsche BankMaintainsHoldView More Analyst Ratings for STXStory continuesView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

NWL has come up with a restructuring and savings initiative, Project Phoenix, to be implemented by the end of 2023. The plan aims to reduce overhead costs, streamline its operating model, centralize supply-chain functions and increase efficiencies.Management also intends to reduce international dependence by moving to a One Newell go-to-market approach in key regions. It noted that the updated operating model would include three operating segments. Notably, the company will combine its Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances and Home Solutions segments to form one operating segment, Home &amp; Commercial Solutions. Learning &amp; Development and Outdoor &amp; Recreation will remain the company’s other two operating segments.The move comes after the success of Project Ovid and is likely to drive significant margin improvement in the long term. The new restructuring initiative will also generate significant savings and help offset the impacts of macro-economic headwinds.Post implementation, NWL anticipates annualized pre-tax savings of $220-$250 million. Restructuring and related charges are estimated to be $100-$130 million and are likely to be incurred by the end of 2023. The plan will also result in the reduction of office positions by approximately 13%, starting from the first quarter of 2023.These aforementioned efforts are in response to the tough economic environment, including significant inflation in food, housing and energy, leading to reduced consumer discretionary spending.On its last reported quarter’s earning call, management expects discretionary spending levels to remain constrained. The strengthening of the dollar is concerning, and is likely to impact the company’s top and bottom lines in the near future.Owing to the downsides, the company posted dull third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, whereas the top line lagged the same. Both metrics declined year over year. The company’s third-quarter normalized earnings per share of 53 cents fell slightly from 54 cents a year ago.Net sales declined 19.2% year over year to $2,252 million. This includes the adverse impacts of the sale of the Connected Home &amp; Security (CH&amp;S) business, unfavorable foreign currency, and the exit of its category and retail store. Also, core sales fell 10.8%, as one of the seven business units witnessed core sales growth.Consequently, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company slashed its guidance for 2022 to reflect the adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency and inflation. The company anticipates net sales of $9.35-$9.43 billion, down from the earlier mentioned $9.37-$9.58 billion. Core sales are expected to decline 3-4% compared with the prior stated 2-4% decrease, excluding the contribution from the CH&amp;S business. The normalized operating margin is expected to be 10-10.3%, down from the prior stated 10-10.5%. Normalized earnings per share are forecast to be $1.56-$1.61, down from the previously communicated $1.56-$1.70 for 2022.Story continuesFor fourth-quarter 2022, net sales are envisioned to be $2.18-$2.26 billion, with a core sales decline of 9-12%. For the quarter, the company expects a normalized operating margin of 5.1-6.5% and normalized earnings of 9-14 cents per share. Both guidances include the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency, closures of Yankee Candle stores, and the exit of certain product categories, particularly in the Outdoor &amp; Recreation, and Home Appliances segments. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of Newell have gained 1.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 7.9% growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely e.l.f.

TROW is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2022 results before the opening bell on Jan 26. TROW’s quarterly earnings and revenues are projected to have declined from the year-ago reported figures.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net revenues declined because of a fall in assets under management (AUM) and investment advisory fees.T. Rowe Price does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged in two of the trailing four quarters.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. QuoteTROW’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter won analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings of $1.73 per share has moved 1.2% upward over the past seven days. However, the figure indicates a decline of 45.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for revenues of $1.53 billion indicates a 22.2% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q4The performance of asset managers in the fourth quarter is expected to have been affected by transitory challenges in the industry. The decline in global markets, which depressed net flows across the industry in the first nine months of 2022, is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.Secular trends like market share tilt from active to passive; open-ended mutual funds to exchange traded funds, collective investment trusts, and SMAs; and public markets to private markets are expected to have affected TROW’s quarterly performance.Amid the challenging operating environment, T. Rowe Price is likely to have continued to record net outflows in the fourth quarter. Per the company’s monthly metrics data, it recorded net outflows of $17.1 billion in the quarter under review.Despite this, the company’s preliminary AUM of $1.28 trillion as of Dec 31, 2022, increased 3.7% from $1.23 trillion recorded as of Sep 30, 2022.Although the preliminary AUM balance shows a sequential rise, TROW’s investment management business is likely to have been negatively impacted by market fluctuations and foreign exchange translations. The consensus estimate for investment advisory fees of $1.37 billion indicates a fall of 5.3% from the previous quarter’s reported figure.Also, the consensus estimate for administrative, distribution and servicing fees of $136 million indicates a fall of 6.2% from the previous quarter’s reported figure.Coming to expenses, T. Rowe Price is expected to have incurred higher employee compensation expenses due to rising salaries on account of inflation. The company’s initiatives to attract investment advisory clients and additional investments from its existing clients are expected to have led to significant expenditure. Thus, overall expenses are expected to have risen in the quarter under review, impeding bottom-line growth.Management expects capital expenditure (including internal labor capitalization) of $250 million in 2022. The company estimates 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses (including a full year of OHA's operating expenses) to rise 4-7%.Story continuesEarnings WhispersAccording to our proven model, the chances of T. Rowe Price beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are high. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: T.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Warren, for US$2.5m worth of shares, at about US$192 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$180. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. Kevin Warren was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does United Parcel Service Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that United Parcel Service insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$82m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About United Parcel Service Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded United Parcel Service shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of United Parcel Service insider transactions leaves us cautious. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for United Parcel Service you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

UPS is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31, before market open.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for United Parcel this earnings season.Q4 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for United Parcel’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues and our estimate for the same are both pegged at $28.09 billion, indicating 1.15% year-over-year growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter U.S. Domestic Package revenues is pegged at $18,442 million, indicating 4.2% growth from the year-ago reported figure. An increase in revenue per piece due to robust improvement in all products is likely to have boosted segmental revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter International Package revenues is pegged at $5,432 million, indicating 0.6% growth from the year-ago reported figure. An increase in revenue per piece is expected to have aided segmental revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Supply Chain and Freight revenues is pegged at $4,257 million, indicating an 8.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. Softness in the air and ocean freight forwarding operations is likely to have weighed on the segmental revenues.On the flip side, high fuel costs are likely to have dented UPS’s bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Supply-chain challenges are likely to have hurt operations. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UPS’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 1.6% in the past 90 days.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for United Parcel this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesUnited Parcel has an Earnings ESP of -1.21% and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q3United Parcel's third-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.99 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84. The earnings beat was primarily due to higher delivery prices. Favorable pricing more than offset the downside caused by declining shipping volumes. The bottom line increased 10.33% year over year.Quarterly revenues of $24,161 million, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24,319.8 million. The top line increased 4.2% year over year, driven by the uptick in revenue per piece shipped.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings:American Airlines AAL has an Earnings ESP of +9.79% and a Zacks Rank #2.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis package delivery service is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.3%.Revenues are expected to be $27.95 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UPS?For UPS, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UPS will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that UPS would post earnings of $2.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.99, delivering a surprise of +5.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.UPS doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

American Express also benefited from better volumes and higher Card Member spending, due to a significant increase in Travel and Entertainment spending. However, the positives were partially offset by higher operating costs.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 per share for fourth-quarter earnings has witnessed no movement in the past week. The consensus mark is flat with the year-ago reported figure. American Express beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 11.3%. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $14.3 billion, suggesting a jump of 17.3% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect fourth-quarter revenues to witness a 13.2% year-over-year increase.Factors to NoteAmEx is likely to have witnessed improved volumes in the to-be-reported quarter, a trend seen over the last few quarters. It might have expanded, owing to total network volumes and billed business volumes. A rise in the overall spending level is likely to have boosted Discount revenues, AXP’s largest revenue driver.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Discount revenues indicates 17.3% year-over-year growth. Our estimate suggests an 11.4% year-over-year increase in Discount revenues for the quarter under review.Travel and Entertainment (T&amp;E) is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world, overcoming the COVID-19 woes. T&amp;E-related spending is expected to have increased in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fees, commissions and other revenues are likely to have improved on the back of an uptick in travel-related revenues. Card acquisitions in some of AXP’s largest travel co-brand portfolios are likely to have increased.Story continuesCards-in-force is expected to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. Both the consensus mark and our estimate for total cards-in-force indicate a 10% year-over-year increase.American Express’s net interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The consensus mark for AXP’s net interest income suggests an upside of 28.3% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect the figure to increase 23.6% from the year-ago period. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income indicates a 55.4% year-over-year increase while our estimate suggests a 49.7% year-over-year surge.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have contributed to AXP’s fourth-quarter performance. However, the rising expenses in global commercial services, card member rewards, marketing and business development are expected to have partially offset the profits. Our estimate suggests total expense increase of 17.3% year over year in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Express this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -4.28%.

AX has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

However, in the third quarter of 2022, it saw the normalization of inventory levels within residential distributor channels. PNR had planned to clear out nearly $200 million of the channel inventory pool in the fourth quarter. These optimization efforts are expected to have impacted volume levels in the quarter under review. Also, the pool business has historically tended to be at lower levels in the fourth compared to the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. These factors are likely to get reflected in PNR’s top-line performance in the fourth quarter.Pentair has been witnessing a tight supply of raw materials such as metals, resins and electronics along with rising logistics costs. While it has been implementing pricing actions and focusing on productivity improvements that may have negated these headwinds, supply-chain pressures and inflationary costs are likely to have weighed on the quarter’s performance.During the first nine months of 2022, the Consumer Solutions segment saw a year-over-year decline in the backlog. Shipments outpaced new orders during the period as customers balanced the need to place new orders with market demand and channel inventory levels. This downward trend may continue in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the backlog is expected to return to historical levels.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Solutions segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $644 million, suggesting an improvement of 2% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit for the quarter is pinned at $147 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies segment’s revenues is pegged at $363 million, indicating an improvement of 1% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit stands at $58 million, suggesting growth of 7% from the $54 million reported a year ago.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of the company have declined 42.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 48.6% plunge.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some Industrial Products stocks, which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Deere &amp; Co.

400,21e7d377-c547-32fa-b40d-6593ac6dd40f,OXY,2023-01-25,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-attracting-140002322.html,1674568802,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 5.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.64 points to a change of +278% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 indicates a change of -28.7% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $37.41 billion and $34.1 billion estimates indicate +42.2% and -8.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $5.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -25.98%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this credit card issuer and bank would post earnings of $5.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.20, delivering a surprise of -16.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Capital One , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, posted revenues of $9.04 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.40%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Capital One shares have added about 15.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.7%.What's Next for Capital One?While Capital One has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Capital One: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.19 on $8.91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $15.99 on $36.45 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Consumer Loans is currently in the bottom 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Mr Cooper (COOP), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 10.This reinsurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -49.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Mr Cooper's revenues are expected to be $360 million, down 42.4% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's kick it off with Microsoft. You're looking at gains of just about 4% here after-hours, the company beating expectations when it comes to adjusted EPS, $2.32. The estimate was for $2.30. Revenue just a bit light there, 52.75 billion. The estimate was for 52.93 billion.But the cloud business growth there, that's what's really driving the stock here after-hours. Intelligent Cloud revenue beating the Street's expectation, 21.51 billion. And that's growth of about 18%, growth of 24% in constant currency. Again, you're looking at the stock pop here, up about 4% after-hours. And competitor Amazon, AWS, the cloud number there boosting Amazon's stock after-hours, looking at Amazon's gains of just about 3%.Let's take a look at Capital One, that stock under pressure here following its earnings report, off just over 1 and 1/2%. Their fourth quarter EPS missed the Street's expectations, coming in just about $1 below at $2.82. The estimate was for $3.79. Revenue, a slight beat there, just over 9 billion. Provisions for credit losses higher than what the Street was looking for here, 2.42 billion. The estimate was for $1.85 billion, really indicative of the broader economic environment and the downturn maybe that we could potentially see here over the coming months.Car delinquency and also auto delinquency, both of those numbers growth up about over on a year over year basis. We're looking at losses of just about 1 and 1/2%. Taking a look at Texas Instruments, that stock is now back in positive territory after-hours, up just about 2/10 of a percent. Sales, though, dropping for the first time since 2020. They also offered a pretty tepid forecast. Some of their expectations there at the lower end of Wall Street's range.Story continuesTaking a look at some of these numbers, revenue declining 3.4% year over year. But it was better than what the Street was looking for. They reported 4.67 billion. The estimate was for 4.61 billion. EPS, $2.13-- that was better than what the Street was looking for. Gains of just about 2/10 of a percent.Also keep a close eye on Fox and News Corp.

UPS is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31, before market open.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for United Parcel this earnings season.Q4 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for United Parcel’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues and our estimate for the same are both pegged at $28.09 billion, indicating 1.15% year-over-year growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter U.S. Domestic Package revenues is pegged at $18,442 million, indicating 4.2% growth from the year-ago reported figure. An increase in revenue per piece due to robust improvement in all products is likely to have boosted segmental revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter International Package revenues is pegged at $5,432 million, indicating 0.6% growth from the year-ago reported figure. An increase in revenue per piece is expected to have aided segmental revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Supply Chain and Freight revenues is pegged at $4,257 million, indicating an 8.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. Softness in the air and ocean freight forwarding operations is likely to have weighed on the segmental revenues.On the flip side, high fuel costs are likely to have dented UPS’s bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Supply-chain challenges are likely to have hurt operations. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UPS’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 1.6% in the past 90 days.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for United Parcel this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesUnited Parcel has an Earnings ESP of -1.21% and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q3United Parcel's third-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.99 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84. The earnings beat was primarily due to higher delivery prices. Favorable pricing more than offset the downside caused by declining shipping volumes. The bottom line increased 10.33% year over year.Quarterly revenues of $24,161 million, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24,319.8 million. The top line increased 4.2% year over year, driven by the uptick in revenue per piece shipped.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings:American Airlines AAL has an Earnings ESP of +9.79% and a Zacks Rank #2.

418,3dbb427b-d053-3484-af74-20edde816cfd,NSC,2023-01-25,4 Transportation Stocks Likely to Surpass Q4 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-transportation-stocks-likely-surpass-112811091.html,1674559691,STORY,"['JBLU', 'ODFL', 'NSC', 'AAL']","[The widely diversified Zacks Transportation sector, housing airlines, railroads, trucking and shipping companies, among others, continues to be aided by improved freight demand and the rebound in demand for air travel after enduring pandemic lows.These positives contributed to the results of the handful of sector participants who have already reported fourth-quarter 2022 results. The same tailwinds should help entities like JetBlue Airways JBLU, Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC, Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL and American Airlines AAL post better-than-expected earnings per share for the December quarter.Let’s delve deep into the factors that are likely to boost the fourth-quarter results of the sector participants who are yet to announce earnings.Despite headwinds like supply-chain woes and inflationary pressures, freight demand has been impressive. This has supported growth of sector participants like NSC and ODFL. On a seasonally adjusted basis, Cass Freight shipments Index improved 1.2% month over month in December. The index improved on a seasonally adjusted basis month over month in two (October and December) of the three months of the fourth quarter. Upbeat crude and product tanker rates should aid the results of the shipping companies in the December quarter.Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ urge for online shopping refuses to relent. Apart from consumer habits, the digitalization-related trend is helping e-commerce demand stay strong.Another major positive is the stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand. People are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities. Strong passenger volumes are likely to drive results of the yet-to-report airline companies. The presence of the Thanksgiving holiday period during the fourth quarter is likely to have boosted passenger volumes.Our  Earnings Preview report suggests that the transportation sector’s quarterly earnings (considering S&amp;P 500 participants only) are likely to increase 36.8% from the third-quarter 2022 actuals.Story continuesHere’s How to Pick the Right StocksAgainst the current backdrop and amid a large number of transportation stocks, it is always a daunting task for investors to pick a winning basket of stocks with the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While there is no foolproof method of choosing outperformers, our proprietary methodology — the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — helps identify stocks with high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement.

420,2307cd16-4622-359f-aa0b-8ce753c0a200,KO,2023-01-25,Investors Heavily Search CocaCola Company The (KO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cocacola-company-140002978.html,1674568802,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -5.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has lost 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.55 indicates a change of +2.7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.82 billion and $44.01 billion estimates indicate +10.8% and +2.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:WM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Waste Management The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Waste ManagementIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO, John Morris, sold US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$168 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$152. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Waste Management insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Waste Management better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Waste Management insiders own about US$107m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Waste Management Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Waste Management shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Waste Management insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Waste Management and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Meanwhile, 4.5% of Gen Z and millennials in the 25 to 34 age group of single filers included cryptocurrency sales transactions in their returns, compared to 2.9% overall.""The tax return is a window into consumer life and it provides insights into generational shifts, the macro-economic world, and premonition on upcoming trends,"" said Varun Krishna, EVP &amp; General Manager, Consumer Group at Intuit.

When adjusting for inflation, the median income saw a 5.3% increase year-over-year.EmploymentMillennials and Gen Z are leading when it comes to changing employment. Employer relationships become more stable with age. 73% of employed, single tax filers between the ages of 18 and 24 had at least one change of employer in 2021, compared to 33.2% of those between 45 and 54.Cryptocurrency2.9% of returns overall included cryptocurrency transactions for 2021.

423,260b5797-8855-31ec-9077-4a3f4cadba9e,INTU,2023-01-25,7 Tech Stocks Every Smart Investor Should Own in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-tech-stocks-every-smart-180751360.html,1674324471,STORY,"['KLIC', 'GOOGL', 'STM', 'INTU', 'MSFT', 'SE', 'DIS']","[While the innovation space suffered in 2022, investors should still keep an eye out for compelling tech stocks to own this year. True, you never want to dismiss steep volatility. In such cases, the valuation of impacted companies fell for a reason, and usually not a good one. Nevertheless, being too pensive with the equities sector imposes possible opportunity costs.Moreover, the tech stocks to own this year enjoy a fundamental advantage. Unlike mature, well-established enterprises, companies that forward the latest advancements across various functionalities will likely always be in demand. After all, the word “progress” implies forward movement, not regression. As well, even under a possible recession, nations will still invest in their future. Therefore, while it’s an unnerving prospect, the red ink from last year may be your friend. Below are the tech stocks to own for 2023.GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$99.28MSFTMicrosoft$240.22INTUIntuit$398.07KLICKulicke and Soffa$49.73STMSTMicroelectronics$41.79CCRDCoreCard$32.80SESea Ltd.$65.86InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comInternet technology firm Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered a brutal beatdown last year. There’s no other way to put it. In the trailing year, the GOOG Class C shares dropped nearly 30% in equity value. Even in the trailing half-year period when other securities bounced dramatically higher, GOOG finds itself 18% below parity. Still, it likely ranks among the tech stocks to own this year.Fundamentally, you can’t ignore Alphabet’s core Google ecosystem. Yes, invariably, the Google brand implies the search engine platform, where it utterly dominates the global market. However, it’s the entire ecosystem that matters. From search to social media (via YouTube) to cloud-based software (such as Google Docs), the Alphabet umbrella has become inextricably ingrained in the modern economy.Story continuesAlso, Wall Street analysts rate GOOG a strong buy. And not just that but a unanimous strong buy. That’s right, despite the aforementioned 30% trailing-year loss, experts refuse to rate GOOG a hold, let alone a sell. Combined with recently spiking positive hedge fund sentiment, Alphabet represents one of the tech stocks to own this year.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs an always-relevant prospect for your portfolio, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) naturally deserves consideration for tech stocks to own. Still, its utilitarian profile didn’t spare the company from volatility in 2022. In the trailing year, MSFT gave up 23% of equity value, which isn’t particularly encouraging. Still, market participants should keep a close eye on this company.For one thing, Microsoft’s investment in artificial intelligence specialist OpenAI may pay dividends. The tech and software giant seeks to incorporate ChatGPT, an AI-driven chatbot that promotes interfacing through normal language, in its Bing search engine. Over time, some experts believe that Bing could become a competitor to Google.Now, such rivalry may take time to develop because Google is so entrenched in the mainstream consciousness. Still, Microsoft and Alphabet can co-exist. Both have their niche relevancies, particularly in the broad business ecosystem.Finally, analysts appreciate MSFT, rating it a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target implies a potential upside of nearly 22%. Therefore, it makes the ranks of tech stocks to own this year.Intuit (INTU)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comOn the surface level, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) seems to be going absolutely nowhere. Specializing in tax and accounting software, Intuit appears relevant. However, in the trailing year, INTU gave up more than 30% of its equity value. Further, it’s not off to an auspicious start in the new year, shedding over 3%. Still, I peg this as one of the tech stocks to own this year and for many years down the line.Fundamentally, as I’ve mentioned several times before, Intuit will likely play a meaningful role in the gig economy. Recently, entertainment giant Disney (NYSE:DIS) ruffled feathers when CEO Bog Iger requested that currently, hybrid workers return to the office. Mostly, I believe that the worker bees will tow the corporate line. However, a good many from Disney and other back-to-office companies will revolt, thereby cynically bolstering the gig economy.But here’s the thing: filing W-2 tax forms for corporate employees on balance represents an easier task than filing 1099 forms. The latter (which gig workers or independent contractors must file) involves more granular disclosures. Fortunately, Intuit’s programs may help, making INTU one of the tech stocks to own.Kulicke and Soffa Industries (KLIC)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockFor arguably the vast majority of American investors, when it comes to tech stocks to own, Kulicke and Soffa Industries (NASDAQ:KLIC) does not come to mind – as in, not at all. It’s not for a lack of relevance. Per its public profile, the Singapore-rebased Kulicke is a leading provider of semiconductor, LED, and electronic assembly solutions serving the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing, and industrial markets.Unfortunately, in a crowded field, KLIC found it too easy to get lost in the shuffle. Therefore, it’s down about 7.5% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, positive momentum finally picked up, with KLIC gaining over 14% since the January opener. Financially, Kulicke deserves serious consideration for tech stocks to own because of its undervalued status.Currently, the market prices shares at less than 7 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 17 times. More importantly, the company commands an outstandingly stable balance sheet, with a strong cash-to-debt ratio of almost 19 times. As well, Kulicke sparks excellent business quality based on its return on equity of over 37%.STMicroelectronics (STM)A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustrationSource: whiteMocca / ShutterstockAnother less-than-celebrated innovator is STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM). While you might not recognize the brand name, chances are, you’ve used (or are still using) its products. A global semiconductor firm, STMicroelectronics manufactures and delivers technology-imbued microchips which undergird modern innovations. These include electric vehicles, key FOBs, factory equipment, and data centers, to name but a few categories.To be sure, the behind-the-stage relevancies didn’t quite spare STM stock from volatility in 2022. In the trailing year, STM declined by 10%. However, astute market participants have caught onto the opportunity, bidding up shares by over 15% so far this year. Better yet, STMicroelectronics may have more room to run.Financially, the company represents another fiscally stable enterprise that enjoys an objectively undervalued business profile. Presently, the market prices STM at 10.3-times forward earnings, well under the sector median of 18.9 times. Moreover, the semiconductor specialist sports strong profit margins. Overall, then, it’s well worth consideration for tech stocks to own in 2023.CoreCard (CCRD)Online banking businessman using smartphone with credit card Fintech and Blockchain conceptSource: Joyseulay / Shutterstock.comOn the surface level, CoreCard (NYSE:CCRD) might seem risky based on its underlying business. Per its website, CoreCard delivers a powerful and integrated solution for any type of card issuing program including complex credit. In simple terms, the architecture enables its client enterprises to manage all aspects of their card programs under one umbrella.Of course, eroding consumer sentiment – particularly due to rising inflation in 2022 – presents viability concerns. If people start cutting their spending en masse, CoreCard may likewise lose relevance. On the other hand, money velocity data indicates that at least up to the third quarter of last year, spending accelerated. Therefore, CoreCard may enjoy rising demand in 2023.Granted, CCRD ranks among the riskiest tech stocks to own this year. However, objectively, CoreCard is undervalued, with the market pricing shares at 18 times trailing earnings. That’s below the sector median of 26 times. Also, the company benefits from a strong balance sheet, particularly an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.82 times that rank better than nearly 86% of its rivals.Sea Ltd (SE)ecommerce company nogin, NOGN stockSource: ShutterstockArguably the most disappointing name among tech stocks to own this year, Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE) started off so swimmingly following the spring doldrums of 2020. SE soared to stratospheric heights late into 2021. However, seemingly trading in sympathy with the rapidly imploding cryptocurrency market, SE likewise suffered a deleterious price action. Indeed, in the trailing year, shares lost 64% of their equity value.To be certain, when companies lose that much value, there’s a reason for it. Often, it’s a very toxic one. Despite the obvious negative implications, though, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Sea’s future. Presently, the experts peg SE as a consensus moderate buy. On average, they target a return to the $88.54 price target. This implies an upside potential of over 44%.While I’m not going to dismiss the many risks associated with SE, here’s the deal: the company is fortuitously positioned in the promising internet economy of Southeast Asia. According to Reuters, even with a downgraded forecast, analysts believe this segment will command a valuation of $330 billion by 2025. Therefore, it’s worth putting SE on your radar of tech stocks to own this year.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 5.36%.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $2.83 per share, indicating an increase of 4.4% year over year.The same for revenues stands at $4.95 billion, suggesting growth of 5.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteStryker's MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment witnessed substantial sales growth on the back of improvement across all its subsegments in the third quarter. Improvement in volumes of products contributed to the upside, partially offset by lower prices. This momentum is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter.With respect to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment, growth across Hip, Knee, and Trauma and Extremities subsegments is likely to have favored the segment's fourth-quarter performance.Stryker is committed to the sustained expansion of Mako. This growth reflects the demand for its differentiated Mako robotic technology. The company witnessed both domestic and international growth (in Japan, Korea and emerging markets) in the third quarter of 2022. On its third-quarter earnings call, the company stated that it had a robust order book for Mako. The robust demand for Mako is likely to have contributed to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment's performance in the to-be-reported quarter. However, variability in the hospital environment may have offset some of the gains.Stryker completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Vocera Communications’s common stock in February. Per management, the buyout will enable Stryker to enter the fast-growing digital care coordination and communications segment. The company has been continuing well with the Vocera integration progress. Investors will likely look for the potential impact of this integration when the company reports fourth-quarter results.Story continuesStryker Corporation Price and ConsensusStryker Corporation Price and ConsensusStryker Corporation price-consensus-chart | Stryker Corporation QuoteStryker raised the lower end of its guidance for revenue growth in 2022, considering its strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in the implant businesses during the third quarter.However, ongoing supply chain disruptions and foreign currency movements are likely to have hurt its sales growth during the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Procedural volumes in China may have suffered a negative impact due to strict lockdown restrictions across major cities in the country. However, the impact of the economy’s recent opening is yet to be seen.  The recent inflationary pressure is likely to have hurt its net margin, thus limiting its growth.Stryker is taking action to lessen the rising inflationary pressures. It is also taking several cost-cutting initiatives, including restructuring plans. Although these initiative may help Stryker to boost its growth, they are likely to  drive expenses in the upcoming few quarters. Investors are likely to ask questions on the progress of these strategic initiatives and their impact going forward on the fourth-quarter earnings call.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here as you will see.Earnings ESP: Stryker has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Fundamentally, the geopolitical crisis in Eastern Europe sparked a ripple effect across the world. Naturally, this terrible circumstance will impact the global economy, necessitating strategic accommodation.As well, world leaders must still manage the aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic. For instance, at first, the Federal Reserve injected the U.S. monetary system with liquidity. However, 2022 became the year that this extra liquidity was spent aggressively – as judged by the increase in money velocity. Not surprisingly, the subsequent inflationary crisis imposed dramatic changes for everyone.Given the myriad disruptions, investors need to think carefully about their future. In that respect, below are the retirement stocks to own in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSRESempra Energy$157.99CVXChevron$180.90NEENextEra Energy$81.82SCCOSouthern Copper$75.05CAGConagra Brands$37.98KOCoca-Cola$60.08IBMIBM.$141.20Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comFor many pundits of the state of California which Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) calls home, the inclusion of SRE on this list of retirement stocks to own may appear ironic. While the sting of inflation caused Californians to leave the Golden State – many to other countries – it’s also inflation that makes Sempra Energy relevant. Because public utilities enjoy inelastic demand, people will find a way to pay up.No, it’s not a nice narrative. And I acknowledge that few people have joyous opinions about Sempra. However, here’s the harsh reality of the matter. California represents the economic engine of the U.S. Not only that, at the current run rate, the Golden State stands poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. So, people will find a way to pay.Story continuesFor investors, not only do they enjoy the decent market performance (up 15.5% in the trailing year), the company offers a forward yield of 2.94%. Therefore, it’s worth consideration for retirement stocks to own this year.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAs much as go-green advocates would like to see hydrocarbon energy specialists become extinct, current trends seem to suggest that they’ll be relevant for decades (not just years) to come. For those seeking retirement stocks to own, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) offers both pertinence and long-term confidence. What’s more, geopolitical conflicts only embolden the case for CVX stock.For one thing, Chevron gained over 39% of equity value in the trailing year, well above many other enterprises. Undoubtedly, much of this upside stemmed from inflation. But it’s also fair to point out that geopolitical blackmailing effectively sparked major concerns about energy supply chains. Yes, over time, this may help integrate green solutions. But societies need solutions now, which augurs well for CVX.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg Chevron as a consensus moderate buy. As well, hedge fund interest remains strong despite opposition rhetoric. Finally, the oil giant offers a forward yield of 3.17%, making it an attractive name among retirement stocks to own.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockAlthough the immediacy of the aforementioned geopolitical conflict gave hydrocarbon energy firms a leg up, it doesn’t mean that green renewable sources will die an ignominious death. Rather, because of demographic dynamics such as rising global populations and immigration, the U.S. will need all available power sources. Therefore, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) deserves consideration for retirement stocks to own.One of the biggest investors in infrastructures that promote goals for net-zero emissions, NEE makes for an ideal retirement narrative. While a perfectly green and sustainable future might be beyond many of our lifetimes, the political winds suggest that companies like NextEra will continue to gain support over the next several decades.Moreover, NextEra enjoys many of the features of popular retirement stocks to own such as passive income. Though its forward yield of 2.06% isn’t the most generous, its payout ratio is only modestly high at 50.19%. Therefore, stakeholders can depend on it.Southern Copper (SCCO)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comA mining firm, Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO), in addition to specializing in its namesake commodity also produces molybdenum, silver, and zinc. While the mining segment usually makes for poor retirement stocks to own due to their volatility, an exception might be made for Southern Copper. With the technologies of tomorrow highly dependent on core commodities, SCCO enjoys long-term relevance.In particular, its main copper business may skyrocket in demand over the next several years. The metal is a vital component of electric vehicle production, integrated into electric motors, batteries, and wiring, among others. Further, automakers use copper for combustion-powered cars as well (though not to the same magnitude as EVs). Therefore, no matter what the economy throws at Southern Copper, it should respond well.To be fair, SCCO does carry risks, with analysts rating shares a consensus hold. Still, over the long run, rising relevancies should make the underlying enterprise attractive. Moreover, SCCO features a forward yield of 2.63%, providing passive income while stakeholders wait for the narrative to pan out.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) enjoys its status as one of the retirement stocks to own due to underlying indispensable needs. While it’s difficult to predict what innovations may materialize in the future, one thing’s for certain: everyone needs to eat. Therefore, the target industry alone makes CAG worth a look.Interestingly, against the trailing year, CAG wasn’t performing that well. However, in recent months, the issuing firm managed to spark positive momentum. On the fundamental front, Conagra recently topped quarterly profit and revenue expectations. In addition, the company raised its annual forecasts, encouraging stakeholders to ride a possible sustained bullish resurgence.Currently, Conagra enjoys a moderate buy consensus view among covering analysts. As well, the company offers a decent dividend, with a forward yield of 3.45%. Further, the payout ratio is only modestly high at 46.84%. Overall, CAG makes for a solid contribution among retirement stocks to own.Coca-Cola (KO)Coins stacked next to a calculator that says ""retirement plan."" Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockWith millennials’ food and beverage consumption habits leaning toward the healthier end of the spectrum, soft drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) appears rather irrelevant. After all, your standard Coca-Cola beverage represents everything that millennials supposedly hate: processed, sugary, and generally bad for your health (if consumed too frequently). And plus, it’s a big, corporate brand – one of few that symbolizes American capitalism.Still, the company – as maligned as it might appear to certain young consumers – commands much respect among Wall Street analysts. Currently, KO shares enjoy a consensus strong buy view. It would have been unanimous had it not been for one literal holdout with a hold assessment. Still, with an average price target that implies over 12% upside from here, it’s not a bad gig.Another factor to consider for KO as one of the retirement stocks to buy is the underlying dividend. Featuring a forward yield of 2.95%, it’s conspicuously higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Moreover, Coca-Cola commands 61 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, a status it won’t give up on easily.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVWhile the tech sector typically offers growth opportunities, it also offers intriguing ideas for retirement stocks to own. A relatively underappreciated pick in this fast-evolving arena is IBM (NYSE:IBM). Historically, IBM dominated the industry when hardware ruled the tech ecosystem. But with greater attention paid to software and cloud-based architectures, “Big Blue” found itself lagging.After many growing pains, IBM looks like a dependable you can trust for a long-term investment. For instance, while so many other tech players suffered steep losses in 2022, IBM managed to gain over 7% in the trailing year. Further, the company features a slow-and-steady approach to its business. Since Q4 2020, the company at minimum met its target for earnings per share.Finally, for those who seek decent passive income tied to dependable businesses, IBM offers an intriguing opportunity. Right now, it carries a forward yield of 4.69%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company commands 29 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Again, it’s a status management that won’t want to give up on too cheaply.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

442,c21d3d07-1d7b-3962-b2a3-48ec881593de,VLO,2023-01-25,Phillips 66 (PSX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-earnings-expected-150003344.html,1674572403,STORY,"['PSX', 'VLO']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Phillips 66 (PSX) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +47.6%.Revenues are expected to be $36.85 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.78% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Phillips 66?For Phillips 66, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Phillips 66 will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Phillips 66 would post earnings of $4.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.46, delivering a surprise of +29.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Phillips 66 doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, Valero Energy (VLO), is soon expected to post earnings of $7.45 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +201.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $40.97 billion, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Valero Energy has been revised 21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season, in addition to featuring new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), BHP Group Limited (BHP) and Accenture plc (ACN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;2022 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the reports that came out this morning, we now have Q4 results from 72 S&amp;P 500 or 14.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 72 index members are down -7.5% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues, with 68.1% beating EPS estimates and 65.3% beating revenues estimates. Relative to historical periods, the Q4 beats percentages are on the low side, particularly for EPS beats. The 68.1% EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members compares to 72.2% in the preceding quarter (2022 Q3) and a 20-quarter average of 78.2%. Over the preceding 20-quarter period, the EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members has been as high as 88.9% (in 2021 Q2) and as low as 61.1% (2020 Q1). The beats pecentages on the revenue side are also  on the lower side relative to the preceding 20-quarter period, but not as pronounced as with the EPS beats percentages. This trend of lower beats percentages could change as we go through the remainder of the Q4 reporting cycle. But if it persists, it would indicate that Q4 estimates hadn't fallen as much as was warranted by underlying business conditions. Since management teams are typically quite adept at anchoring such expectations, one could even argue that the shortfall likely took even management teams by surprise. We will see how this trend evolves over the remainder of this reporting cycle, but we are not seeing its direct follow through in estimates for the current period (2023 Q1). Story continuesS&amp;P 500 earnings for 2023 Q1 are currently expected to be down -4.3% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues. This is down from  -4% on January 6th and -2.9% in mid-December 2022.

The company which is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, continues to have a favorable growth outlook on the back of strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.(You can read the full research report on Birkshire Hathaway here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BHP Group shares have outperformed the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (+8.6% vs. +1.2%). The company’s iron ore production rose 2% year over year to 132 Mt in the first half of fiscal 2023 driven by record levels at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO). Its iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2023 is 249-260 Mt, indicating 1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.Iron ore prices have gained so far in 2023, as demand is expected to rise following the easing of restrictions in China amid supply concerns. Going forward, iron ore prices are expected to be supported by demand in the automotive sector, infrastructure and housing market. Copper and nickel prices will also be fueled by growing demand for electric vehicles.  BHP’s investment in growth projects with focus on commodities like copper, nickel and potash will aid growth. Its efforts to make operations more efficient through technology adoption will drive earnings.(You can read the full research report on BHP Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Accenture have underperformed the Zacks Consulting Services industry over the past year (-16.6% vs. -10.8%). The company is facing pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, particularly at a time of softening demand as a result of macroeconomic forces. Global presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Buyout-related integration risks continues to remain a concern.However, Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs. The company has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships.The company’s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential.(You can read the full research report on Accenture here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy. Last year’s economic condition has investors turn their attention toward income-generating stocks. Over the years, dividend companies with resilient business models have helped investors to weather inflationary periods smoothly. Considering the risks of recession and investors’ appetite for dividend stocks, companies are trying to maintain or raise their payouts. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set a record payment in the fourth quarter of 2022, growing by 10.2% from the same period last year. The report also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividend payments have grown for 13 consecutive years.According to analysts, dividend stocks are a good investment option for investors as dividend companies can often grow their payouts faster than inflation. This complies with Guinness Atkinson Funds' report that sheds light on the dividend strategies relative to inflation. The report highlighted that the S&amp;P 500 dividend growth surpassed the rate of inflation by over three times from December 1940 to April 2015.In the past 12 months, dividend stocks have outperformed the broader market. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by only 0.79% in the period, compared with an 8.9% drop in the wider market, as of January 24.Over the years, dividends have contributed significantly to the market’s overall returns. On average, dividends represented 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were below 10% since 1929, as reported by Lord Abbett. Dividend companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have not only raised their payouts for decades but also boast strong balance sheets, which makes them solid investment options.Story continues12 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Nick Chong on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we identified the dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc.

Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 66 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.9133 per share. The stock's dividend yield on January 18 came in at 2.43%.JPMorgan maintained a Neutral rating on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in January and lifted its price target on the stock to $150. The firm presented a positive stance on consumer goods and household companies this year.As of the close of Q3 2022, 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), down from 71 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $4.08 billion. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the past years, and go directly to read 5 Best Low-Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy. US equities suffered huge losses in 2022, marking their worst year since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. However, dividend stocks sustained solid footing during the year due to their ability to generate stable income for shareholders. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, up 10% from 2021. Moreover, most dividend indexes ended 2022 with positive returns, according to a report by Morningstar. The report also mentioned that there was a 20 percentage-point differential between dividend stocks and the broader market last year.Considering the market volatility and investors’ inclination toward dividend securities, many companies steadily raised their payouts over the years. High inflationary periods also bode well for dividend growth in the past. During the 2010s, dividend payments in the S&amp;P 500 grew by 155% after recording a 40% growth in each of the previous two decades, as reported by CME Group. The report also revealed that dividend payments rose by 6% and 12% during the high-inflation decades of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively.Analysts are positive about dividend growth this year as well. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, spoke about dividends in his December interview with Wall Street Journal. He asserted that corporate balance sheets are strong enough to generate enough cash for future dividends. The same report also mentioned that many companies have shown confidence in their cash flows and capital investments to fulfill shareholder obligations through dividends in the upcoming years. Among the companies that have gained investors’ attention over the past years include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United Airlines UAL, Microsoft Corp MSFT, D.R. Horton DHI, Halliburton Co HAL and Chevron CVX.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:3 Key EPS Reports to Watch This WeekThus far, earnings season has been a pleasant surprise on Wall Street. Earnings reactions have been strong, and stocks like United Airlines provided impressive guidance moving forward. However, later this week, Wall Street awaits some of the biggest names on the street to report first-quarter results. Today we will look at 3 key earnings reports to monitor this week:Microsoft Corp is the largest report of the week and will move the tech sector and the entire U.S. market when it reports Q1 EPS Tuesday night. Though the stock has corrected in line with the tech sector in general, Microsoft's valuation is the most attractive it has been in years. The current P/E of 25.89x matches the P/E ratio the software juggernaut saw at the lows of the pandemic correction in early 2020.An attractive valuation is not the only potential catalyst the stock has moving forward. Earlier this morning, the company announced it will invest $10 billion in OpenAI in the next ten years. OpenAI is the creator behind the wildly popular ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) service. Over the weekend, plans to transition the service into a ""freemium"" were announced. Power users can pay $42 per month to avoid delays and reap other premium ChatGPT benefits.Sentiment in housing remains poor as mortgage rates have doubled in recent months and home prices have begun to cool. However, the recent action in homebuilders suggests that something else may be happening beneath the surface. Perhaps supply is drying up, or housing is not as weak as initially anticipated by investors. Either way, housing stocks are at the top of the list for contrarian-minded speculators. Texas-based D.R. Horton is one of the leading homebuilders nationwide. Like MSFT, DHI is becoming attractive on a valuation basis. Its P/E of 5.71x is lower than its valuation at the COVID-19 lows. DHI is expected to report earnings Tuesday.Story continuesHalliburton Co and stocks of the same feather have been the undisputed market leaders over the past few years. Last quarter HAL reported stellar earnings growth of 114% on revenue of 39%. The stock holds a strong Zack's Ranking of 2. While investors expect strong EPS, the critical factor to watch is how the stock reacts to those earnings.Is the strong earnings performance baked into shares already, or is there more gas in the tank? Earnings are due Tuesday for Halliburton. Industry group peer Chevron also reports earnings later in the week on Friday.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Horton (DHI) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.76 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.27 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.17 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 21.59%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this homebuilder would post earnings of $5.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.67, delivering a surprise of -7.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.D.R. Horton , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, posted revenues of $7.26 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.60%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.05 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.D.R. Horton shares have added about 7.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.7%.What's Next for D.R. Horton?While D.R. Horton has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for D.R. Horton: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.14 on $6.49 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.46 on $28.03 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Home Builders is currently in the bottom 15% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, M/I Homes (MHO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 1.This homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.6%.

The same tailwinds should help entities like JetBlue Airways JBLU, Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC, Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL and American Airlines AAL post better-than-expected earnings per share for the December quarter.Let’s delve deep into the factors that are likely to boost the fourth-quarter results of the sector participants who are yet to announce earnings.Despite headwinds like supply-chain woes and inflationary pressures, freight demand has been impressive. This has supported growth of sector participants like NSC and ODFL. On a seasonally adjusted basis, Cass Freight shipments Index improved 1.2% month over month in December. The index improved on a seasonally adjusted basis month over month in two (October and December) of the three months of the fourth quarter. Upbeat crude and product tanker rates should aid the results of the shipping companies in the December quarter.Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ urge for online shopping refuses to relent. Apart from consumer habits, the digitalization-related trend is helping e-commerce demand stay strong.Another major positive is the stronger-than-expected recovery in air-travel demand. People are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities. Strong passenger volumes are likely to drive results of the yet-to-report airline companies. The presence of the Thanksgiving holiday period during the fourth quarter is likely to have boosted passenger volumes.Our  Earnings Preview report suggests that the transportation sector’s quarterly earnings (considering S&amp;P 500 participants only) are likely to increase 36.8% from the third-quarter 2022 actuals.Story continuesHere’s How to Pick the Right StocksAgainst the current backdrop and amid a large number of transportation stocks, it is always a daunting task for investors to pick a winning basket of stocks with the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While there is no foolproof method of choosing outperformers, our proprietary methodology — the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — helps identify stocks with high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement.

It has committed to invest more than $20.4 million by 2028 in improving the system’s reliability and security of the acquired assets.

467,521dda2f-7c22-34f2-bc60-c6e11fb65c93,FCX,2023-01-25,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005550.html,1674579605,STORY,['FCX'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Freeport-McMoRan currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for FCX that show why this mining company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor FCX, shares are up 0.8% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry is down 0.18% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.98% compares favorably with the industry's 17.86% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Freeport-McMoRan have risen 41.84%, and are up 12.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.54% and -7.08%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to FCX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. FCX is currently averaging 11,307,379 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with FCX.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost FCX's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.26 to $2.30 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that FCX is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Freeport-McMoRan on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

468,0b7e6ac3-bfe2-3f7e-87bb-95d499f78d33,FCX,2023-01-25,Bumble and Stanley Black & Decker have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bumble-stanley-black-decker-highlighted-133801891.html,1674567481,STORY,"['SWK', 'BMBL', 'FCX', 'NUE', 'STLD']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 24, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Bumble Inc. BMBL as the Bull of the Day and Stanley Black &amp; Decker SWK as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Freeport McMoRan FCX, Nucor Corporation NUE and Steel Dynamics STLD.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Bumble Inc. is expected to see double digit revenue growth this year and next as people are still turning to the dating apps. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) had a big earnings beat in Q3 2022.Bumble is the parent company of Bumble, Badoo, and Fruitz. Bumble was founded in 2014 and is one of the first dating apps built with women at the center. It connects users through Bumble Date, Bumble BFF, for those looking for friendship, as well as Bumble Bizz, the professional networking segment.Badoo was founded in 2006 and is one of the pioneers of web and mobile dating products. Fruitz was founded in 2017 and uses fruit metaphors to encourage open and honest communications during dating.A Big Beat in the Third QuarterOn Nov 9, 2022, Bumble reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by $0.14. Earnings were $0.14 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.00.It was the third meet or beat in a row.Revenue rose 16.8% to $232.6 million up from $199.1 million a year ago driven by a 27.9% gain in Bumble App Revenue.Badoo App and Other Revenue was not as bullish, as it declined 10.2% to $52 million.Total paying users rose to 3.3 million from 2.9 million with total average revenue per paying User ""ARPPU"" rose to $22.96 from $22.81.Fourth Quarter GuidanceBumble gave fourth quarter guidance on revenue of a range of $232 million to $237 million. It does expect to see a $5 million impact to Badoo App and Other Revenue due to the Ukraine War.Analysts Get Bullish about 2023Bumble won't report earnings again until March 2023. Meanwhile, analysts are getting bullish with 1 estimate raised for 2022 and 2023 within the last week.Story continuesThe 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen to $0.23 from $0.11 in the last 90 days. That's moving in the right direction but it's still down 86.6% from 2022, where the company earned $1.72.Online dating apps, and all apps, in general, saw surging use during the pandemic which has started to wind down as the economy slows and consumers tighten spending.But one estimate is also higher in the last week for 2023. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $0.19 in 2023, which is still down 18% from 2022, but it appears that the analysts were a little too pessimistic.Shares Rally in the Last MonthBumble shares fell 18.9% in the last year, and are well off their 2021 IPO highs.Yet the shares have staged a nice rally in the last month, adding 15.7%.You aren't getting the shares on sale on a P/E basis, however, as they trade with a forward P/E of 126.4.The Street might have been too pessimistic about Bumble in 2022. If you're looking for an online dating app company where the analysts are raising earnings estimates, then Bumble might be one for the short list.Bear of the Day:Stanley Black &amp; Decker is in the midst of a business transformation while it also has to fight inflationary pressures and the challenging macroeconomic environment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings fall for the second year in a row in 2023.Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the world's largest tool company with nearly 50 manufacturing facilities in the United States and more than 100 worldwide.It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners and other industrial equipment. It's iconic brands include DEWALT, BLACK+DECKER, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY, CUB CADET, HUSTLER AND TROY-BILT.Earnings Estimates for 2022 and 2023 Continue to FallStanley Black &amp; Decker will report fourth quarter and full year results on Feb 2, 2023. What will it guide for 2023?Last quarter, on Oct 27, 2022, it lowered its full year guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.65 from $5.00 to $6.00. As you might assume, analysts lowered their estimates accordingly.But they have continued to cut.1 estimate has been cut for 2022 in the last 30 days. 2022 earnings are now expected to fall 57.6% from last year to $4.44, down from $10.48.Analysts are also still bearish on 2023. 2 estimates have been lowered over the last 30 days. Earnings are expected to fall another 5.8% to $4.18. That's down from $6.71 just 3 months ago.It's because of these earnings estimates cuts that the stock has fallen to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The cuts are bearish.Shares Plunge Below the COVID LowsShares of Stanley Black &amp; Decker have fallen 51% over the last year but even more devastating to long-term investors, the shares are now down 48% over the last 5 years as well.Yes, the shares have gotten a bid to start 2023, rising 20.7% over the last month but they aren't cheap, with a forward P/E of 20.5.The good news is that it is still shareholder friendly, paying both a dividend, which it raised for the 55th consecutive year again last year, and doing a share buy back. The dividend is yielding 3.7%.But there is a lot of uncertainty heading into this earnings report. Investors might want to wait on the sidelines to see what the outlook is for 2023.Additional content:3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Before Earnings This WeekMany stocks in the Basic Materials sector outperformed the broader market over the last year and provided a much-needed hedge against inflation.Let's take a look at three highly ranked Basic Material stocks set to report earnings this week that investors may want to consider buying in 2023 as well.Freeport McMoRanStarting the list is mineral exploration and development miner Freeport McMoRan.Freeport is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on January 25, with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Freeport McMoRan conducts its operations primarily through its principal subsidiaries' PT Freeport Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Corporation, and Atlantic Copper. It is important to note that PT Freeport Indonesia's principal asset Papua, is an Indonesia-based mine that contains the world's largest copper and gold reserves.With copper prices hitting their highest levels in the last six months on the London Metal Exchange, Freeport McMoRan stock is sticking out with earnings estimate revisions trending higher for fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22 with its Q4 report.Q4 Preview:The rise in copper prices, primarily attributed to the reopening of China, which is the world's largest copper consumer, is great timing as Freeport McMoRan earnings are expected to have dipped year over year during Q4 after a tough prior-year quarter to follow.Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to dip -58% to $0.40 a share compared to $0.96 a share in Q4 2021. On the top line, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, a -13% decrease from the prior year quarter. Still, an earnings beat on the company's bottom line is not completely out of the picture.Earnings ESP:The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction is a useful tool in indicating which stocks could top quarterly earnings estimates by comparing the Zacks Consensus to the Most Accurate Consensus.With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport McMoRan's Q4 earnings at $0.40 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.42 per share, FCX is expected to beat expectations by 6.96%.Takeaway:Certainly, a strong earnings beat on Freeport McMoRan's bottom line could lead to more upside in the stock. This could be supported by the company potentially offering better-than-expected guidance in correlation with higher copper prices.Nucor Corporation Steel Producer and metal recycler Nucor is another stock investors may want to consider buying ahead of its Q4 earnings on January 26. Nucor stock sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions notably rising for fiscal 2023.Even better, Nucor stock has been one of the top performers out of the basic materials sector over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and is already up 15% to start 2023.Q4 Preview:Following an excellent prior-year quarter, earnings are forecasted at $4.18 per share for Nucor's fourth quarter compared to $7.97 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected at $7.91 billion which would be a -23% YoY decline.However, with iron and steel prices remaining higher despite cooling off recently, it is quite possible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for a fifth consecutive quarter.Earnings ESP: Nucor stock has an ESP of 3.29% as the Zacks Consensus for Q4 earnings is $4.18 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.32 per share indicating the company could beat on its bottom line.Takeaway:Despite the year-over-year quarterly drop in earnings, Nucor stock trades at just 11.8X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 41.4X and a 23% discount to the median of 15.3X.Nucor's valuation appears to already support the likelihood that the company's earnings could decrease as steel prices move lower which still makes the stock attractive at its current levels with earnings estimates going up.Steel DynamicsRounding out the list is Steel Dynamics, which is set to report its Q4 earnings on January 25. Also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Steel Dynamics FY23 earnings estimates have gone up 36% over the last 60 days to $10.82 per share compared to estimates of $7.94 a share two months ago.Steel Dynamics is also a leading steel producer and recycler of metal in the United States and one of the most diversified steel companies in the U.S. with a vast range of specialty products.The performance of Steel Dynamics stock has been incredible over the last year, up +106%, standing out among stocks across any sector.Q4 Preview:Like Nucor, Steel Dynamics follows a stellar prior year fourth quarter. Steel Dynamics Q4 earnings are anticipated at $3.60 per share compared to $5.98 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected to be $4.73 billion and down -11% YoY.Still, it is quite plausible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for what would be a 13th consecutive quarter dating back to January of 2020.Earnings ESP:The Zacks ESP for Steel Dynamics indicates the company could once again beat on its bottom line. With the Zacks Consensus for Nucor's Q4 earnings at $3.60 a share, the most accurate estimate of $3.77 per share indicates the possibility of a 4.82% earnings beat.Takeaway:The top and bottom line growth for Steel Dynamics has been massive over the last few years as steel prices soared, and it is noteworthy that the company has also beaten sales expectations for 12 consecutive quarters.Steel Dynamics also trades attractively relative to its past at just 9.9X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 24.2X and the median of 12.2X.With its valuation also supporting the potential drop in steel prices, Steel Dynamics stock could have more upside especially if the company continues its stellar track record of topping quarterly expectations.Bottom Line After the very impressive top and bottom line growth these basic material stocks had in recent years, investors will definitely want to pay attention to their Q4 earnings. The rising earnings estimate revisions make the possibility of beating Q4 expectations quite plausible for Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, and Steel Dynamic stock and could continue supporting their strong performances.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%.

First up, speaking of industrials, let's talk about 3M falling today after an earnings miss. You can look at the stock closing off just about 6%. Now, the company signaling more turmoil to come this year in 2023. 3M also announcing that it plans to cut 2,500 manufacturing jobs. Layoffs spreading from the tech sector here, Dave, to other industries.We're certainly seeing that reflected more broadly across a number of industries as we brace for more of these types of announcements. We're only, what, two and a half weeks into this earnings season. The majority of those layoffs have been concentrated in technology. But 3M, certainly bracing for what will likely be a challenging couple of quarters, are looking to cut costs. And they're doing it by eliminating some of their headcount.- Yeah, this is an employer of 100,000 employees. So we are starting to get a glimpse of what could potentially be around the corner as you see layoffs spread. And you see predictions for the economy really beginning to soften. They really cite several times slowing demand. And that's the heart of it.I want to highlight something CEO Mike Roman had to say in the earnings call. ""The slower-than-expected growth was due to rapid declines in consumer-facing markets such as consumer electronics and retail, a dynamic that accelerated in December as consumers sharply cut discretionary spending and retailers adjusted inventory levels. We also saw a significant slowing in China due to COVID-related disruption.""So yes, on the tail end, you do have some good news coming around the corner as China begins to reopen. But look, ultimately, the big picture takeaway is that slowing demand consumer-facing side of 3M shows what we're going to be enduring the first half of 2023 is slowing economy, whether we like it or not.Story continues- Yeah, certainly, it is a slowing economy. We know that when you take a look at 3M, oftentimes, it's a bellwether for this sector--- Yeah.--which is why we're placing so much emphasis on this report because it could signal some of those weakening conditions more broadly for the industrial sector. When you take a look at some of their numbers, their outlook there that disappointed, 3M expecting sales to decline 2% to 6%. Now, in terms of what the company will do going forward, they do have the capacity for deals. But they likely will be conservative in this environment in the economy-- in the economy, which is clearly very challenging right now.In terms of TheStreet's reaction to this report, Vital Knowledge was out saying that there's nothing positive in this report, in this guide other than, quote, ""Expectations were already very low. Most of the weakness seems to be confined to that consumer business,"" that you were just talking about. So I guess if we're looking for a positive spin on this, yes, the consumer side of their business, obviously, very weak right now, not necessarily the case for 3M at large.- Looking pretty hard for some positive news.- Very, I know.- Revenue growth of 0.4% on 1% to 3% expectations. While 3M is cutting staffers, other sectors are still struggling to find workers. Union Pacific CEO, Lance Fritz spoke with Yahoo Finance following his company's earnings report earlier today and discussed the state of employment at Union Pacific. You can see shares falling more than 3% on their earnings report. Here is their CEO earlier today.LANCE FRITZ: The hiring picture was very difficult through last year and specifically in areas where we operate in a rural environment where the workforce is small and the unemployment rate are very low. That's areas like in the middle of Iowa, in the middle and Western Nebraska, out into Wyoming, and even up into Minnesota. Now, we're doing things like paying a $25,000 hiring bonus in certain spots. We're adjusting other aspects of the job. We've made sure our training produces a conductor that's fully capable and ready to work.- Boy, that's a telling statement right there, Shannon. I think we're going to see this on so many different sectors of the economy difficult to find employees right now. You know about the labor negotiations in rail and with port workers. You can touch on just about every type of job that falls in line with this-- truck drivers, mechanics, the nurses. There is a shortage of employees. And how you're going to incentivize employees throughout this year is going to be an impossible task if they're offering $25,000 bonuses and still not finding enough employees in this economy.- They aren't finding enough employees in this economy. The word hiring was mentioned 10 times in that earnings call. Really just speaks to the challenge that this presents for Union Pacific here going forward. They have, though, been adding to their headcount. Obviously, not as quickly as they would like. Their headcount is up 4%, just above 31,100. They do have 600 additional workers currently in that training program that Lance Fritz was just talking about.But on this earnings call, when we talk about the impact that it's having on their business, the company is saying that they still have tight spots in the network that are limiting their ability to grow and to ship all of that demand because they simply do not have the workers to meet the demand that their business is facing right now. And not only that, they're also facing higher costs. Another challenge, another headwind here for Union Pacific going forward-- the cost per employee.Talking about some of those incentives there, that grew 6%. That was primarily driven by wage inflation. They need to pay workers more in order to keep the workers that they already have. Also, higher fuel costs. Clearly, a headwind here for the company. Fuel costs were up about 43%, which is clearly hurt their bottom line. We're looking at shares off just about 3%.I also want to quickly take a look at Verizon also out with earnings today, boasting an increased subscriber base and boosted revenue. But guidance for the 2023 fiscal year came in lower than what TheStreet was expecting, Verizon guiding for earnings per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.85. TheStreet have been looking for $4.96 there. So below what TheStreet was looking for. Yet, shares moving to the upside today.I think that subscriber number better than expected. 217,000 new wireless subscribers were added during the fourth quarter. That beat TheStreet's estimates. But clearly, when you stock that against some of its competitors out there, T-Mobile and their prelim number ads, Dave, they said that they added over 900,000. AT&amp;T expected to add over 600,000. So you can clearly see Verizon there losing some of its market share to its biggest competitors.- The CEO saying current levels of sales and discounts being offered across the industry unsustainable, adding that 5G story really has not come to fruition. And they would like investors them to cut spending there.]"

The guidance for 2023 providing some light at the end of the tunnel, with full year operating ratio expecting to improve and carloads to exceed industrial production. Well, here with further insights is Union Pacific CEO, Lance Fritz.Lance, good to have you on the show. So I first want to ask you about this because we were looking at the revenue growth, but then we saw what its been offset by some of these challenges, including operation inefficiencies, elevated operating expenses. What is the plan here to really turn that around and cut some of these costs?LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, Rachelle, first, thank you for hosting me. And also, thank you for recognizing that we did grow last year. We beat our markets, if you will, both in the fourth quarter and in the full year. And it generated positive revenue-- record revenue. But to your point, what are we going to do to recover the productivity and generate improved margins going into next year? First and foremost, it's about making sure that we have crew availability where we need it. Our hiring pipeline is fully charged. And we're graduating about 150 to 200 conductors a month right now. That's the high pace that we exited the year last year.So that gives us confidence we're going to get the resources right. The current network is fluid. We exited last year and are currently performing at a car velocity and a trip plan compliance for our customers that indicates we're a pretty fluid railroad. Now we're an outdoor network, so we're going to be impacted by things like winter storm Elliot at the tail end of December and other things that will occur throughout the year. But with our capital investment, with getting the resources right, and with a very agile and better operating performance, we're confident we're going to get margin improvement in the year.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: And obviously, there are a lot of macroeconomic issues weighing on all companies. But as you mentioned, things like winter weather more specific to your industry, but also some tightness in the labor market. Tell us about the hiring picture and now how that's impacting business.LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, the hiring picture was very difficult through last year and specifically in areas where we operate in a rural environment, where the workforce is small and the unemployment rate are very low. That's areas like in the middle of Iowa, in the middle and western Nebraska, out into Wyoming, and even up into Minnesota. Those areas, we've largely been able to hire recently and fill our classes. But through last year, we were having a heck of a time.Now we're doing things like paying a $25,000 hiring bonus in certain spots. We're adjusting other aspects of the job. We've made sure our training produces a conductor that's fully capable and ready to work. And we've got a wonderful referral program where we ask our employees to refer people they know because great people know great people. And out of about 12,000 plus referrals last year, we generated over 1,200 job offers. So that's a heck of a way for us to fill our classes as well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And certainly helps in a very tight labor market. I do want to look at another bright note in your earnings data there. The operating ratios, which is a measure of efficiency, hitting 61%. Now, obviously, this is above the 60% threshold that a lot of railroad companies were trying to get to since the pandemic. What do you attribute that to? And I know that that's something that you also plan to see improvement in, in this year, in the rest of this year. How do you plan to get there?LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, so Rachelle, if you go back a handful of years, we implemented an operating system that's code word PSR, Precision Scheduled Railroading, in the industry. What it fundamentally means is, we redesigned our network to take work out of the network that didn't need to happen. We were switching cars in areas they didn't need to be. And we were running trains at relatively small train lengths and more of them than we needed on the network.By doing that, we fundamentally lowered our cost structure, which improved our operating ratio. At this point, a big step like that really isn't available. At this point, it's blocking and tackling, using locomotives more efficiently, being fluid, making sure crew availability is high so we can use our crews efficiently, and continuing to look for opportunities to keep adding cars to existing train networks, which is a very productive way to grow.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Lance, I know you've been pushing for more innovation. We know that you joined forces with the Rail Pulse Coalition. What does that mean for how you grow the business from here, what the industry means, and even in terms of perhaps crew size?LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, so Rachelle, Rail Pulse is a good example of some of the technology investments that we're making. That's a consortium of other car owners. They can be railroads. They can be customers. And in that consortium, we've committed to GPS up the rail cars. Rail cars are interesting in that they are on a fixed asset, the rail network. So largely, you know where they are. But when you start interchanging them or sending them into short lines, that visibility gets reduced pretty dramatically. And by putting technology on the rail car, will increase that visibility.There's other investments we're making, like modeling systems to know how to build a tea plan that's more robust, making customer experience better, whether it's dray drivers on one of our intermodal ramps, or customers getting an improved estimated time of arrival, and even the fundamental technology that runs the network, something we call net control, and the computer aided dispatch. All of those are seeing investments and improvements. And they help us run a more fluid and more consistent, reliable network.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, on something that a lot of analysts are also honing in on is the regulatory environment with the Surface Transportation Board, which is the economic regulator for your business. Some potential changes ahead might make it easier for customers to bring cases. What do you say to investors who are perhaps worried about how this might potentially change the operating environment?LANCE FRITZ: So the STB is our primary commercial regulator. And they are active. We've been spending a lot of time with STB members and their staffs, helping them see the rail economy from our perspective and in the light of the kind of regulations that they're thinking about. Generally speaking, the STB wants to get it right. They appreciate that their job is to ensure that the US freight rail network supports growth, supports customers, and is able to reinvest in itself.So, bottom line, they have a vested interest in making sure their decisions are done well. And we just help them see, from our perspective, how that impacts the design of some of the regulations that they're contemplating. So far, so good. They've done a very good job of balancing what they think needs to happen with doing it in a way that maintains the health of the freight rail network.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, I do appreciate you joining me this morning.

480,6e085ac8-f2e6-3a39-9380-4a44fe70a8c8,DGX,2023-01-25,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-report-q4-165004260.html,1674579004,STORY,"['DGX', 'CAH', 'LH', 'MCK']","[Quest Diagnostics Incorporated DGX is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 2, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.36 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.8%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 5.81%.Factors at PlayQuest Diagnostics is likely to have benefited from the continued sales rebound in the non-COVID base business as economic activities return to pre-pandemic levels.In the past few months, the company accelerated growth through health plan access. During the third quarter, the company also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. The company continues to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements and sees increased volumes and pricing from the contracts. We expect these efforts to have contributed to Quest Diagnostics’ fourth-quarter revenues.In November 2022, Quest Diagnostics acquired select assets of LabCare Plus — the outreach laboratory services business of Summa Health — a large integrated health system. With the buyout, the company expands access to diagnostic advancement and insights, empowering better health for more communities in Northeastern Ohio. In the same month, Quest Diagnostics unveiled three new fitness panels on questhealth.com, intended for athletes of every kind, from weekend warriors to gold medalists. The new tests offer precise fitness insights and guidance to tangibly enhance performance and help them minimize their vulnerability to injury. These developments might have partially contributed to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseQuest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Apart from this, during the third quarter, the company made investments to strengthen its capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. In the last reported quarter, Quest Diagnostics launched a new e-commerce platform. The company launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of its consumer-initiated testing offerings, which cover everything from women’s health tests to allergy testing and sexually transmitted infections. These launches are expected to have contributed to the company’s Q4 revenues.Story continuesHowever, the base business is likely to have been impacted by Hurricane Ian and continued inflationary headwinds. To offset the inflationary pressure, Quest Diagnostics has been making several investments to strengthen advanced diagnostics capabilities within the base business and continued to pursue its operational excellence strategy. It has been been closely managing the cost structure through its Invigorate initiatives.In the to-be-reported quarter, Quest Diagnostics’ COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to have declined year over year, thanks to a robust year-ago comparison. However, on a positive note, as per December 2022 media statement, the company noted that COVID-19 testing volume increased throughout November. To improve testing access amid an increase in COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, Quest Diagnostics recently announced that symptomatic individuals may self-collect a nasal specimen for combined COVID-19-influenza molecular testing through approximately 1,600 of our patient service centers in the United States. In addition, Quest continues to partner with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services in the CDC Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) uninsured testing program. The program offers COVID-19 molecular testing through a patient service center network in areas with underserved populations (as defined by the CDC social vulnerability index). This might have provided a favorable boost to the company’s testing sales growth in Q4.Q4 EstimatesFor fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.25 billion, indicating an 18% decline from the prior-year reported figure.
