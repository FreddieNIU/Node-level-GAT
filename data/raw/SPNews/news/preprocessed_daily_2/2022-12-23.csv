But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on Texas Instruments'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:62% = US$8.9b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.62.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 62% ROETo begin with, Texas Instruments has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 19% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Texas Instruments' moderate 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Texas Instruments' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 29% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is TXN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Texas Instruments Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Texas Instruments has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 56%, meaning that it is left with only 44% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Moreover, Texas Instruments is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 61% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, Texas Instruments' ROE is speculated to decline to 45% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Texas Instruments certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings growth is decent, and the high ROE does contribute to that growth. However, investors could have benefitted even more from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

5,3f9537f8-b73e-3c32-9384-99abe0689a26,USB,2022-12-23,Possible bearish signals as U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) insiders disposed of US$2.0m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-u-bancorp-130059938.html,1671714059,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Over the past year, many U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Timothy Welsh, for US$834k worth of shares, at about US$43.92 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$42.71. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At U.S. Bancorp Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of U.S. Bancorp shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. U.S. Bancorp insiders own about US$107m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About U.S. Bancorp Insiders?Insiders haven't bought U.S. Bancorp stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that U.S. Bancorp has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.Of course U.S. Bancorp may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The slow economic growth has increased the risks of a global recession. Ethan Harris, a head of global economics research at Bank of America, spoke to Bloomberg in December about the possibility of a recession at the start of next year. This was also confirmed by World Bank’s president earlier in September, who asserted that the global weakening economy would result in a recession over the next year. In the current market situation, analysts are recommending dividend stocks to generate stable income.In periods of high inflation, dividend stocks have recorded strong performance relative to the broader market. Companies that hold long dividend growth track records are particularly popular in this regard. Dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 10.4% from January 1973 to December 1984, as reported by Sterling Capital. During the same period, non-dividend stocks returned 5.1% annually. The report also mentioned that dividend growers outperformed their peers when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually over the past five decades.The best dividend stocks this year exhibited strong performance and hold decades-long dividend growth track records. Companies that consistently grow their dividends can significantly increase portfolio returns for the long term during turbulent market conditions.

The stock price rose on solid financial results as its business is less exposed to current macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to have the conviction that McKesson can grow earnings per share by an average of 12% to 14% annually and think the stock is still reasonably valued.”11. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)Dividend Yield as of December 21: 1.07%Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is an American global independent energy company that is involved in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas.

Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”9. Walmart Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8.

It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”6.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy. A widow and orphan stock refers to an equity investment that pays a steady dividend and is generally considered to be low-risk, defensive, and non-volatile. These are usually large-cap, stable, and old-economy companies in non-cyclical business sectors. Dividends provide investors with a margin of safety despite the challenging environment for the capital markets, and dividend equities have outperformed non-dividend equities and bonds year-to-date.Investing in dividends, primarily those firms that increase their payouts on a year-over-year basis, can make massive contributions to long-term portfolio returns in an otherwise volatile market. Looking for the highest-yielding dividend stock is usually associated with higher risk. Investors should focus on picking up stocks which have a consistent track record of growing their dividends year after year. Nick Lentini of the Morgan Stanley Equity Strategy team said on November 9: “The investing backdrop of the past year, driven by macroeconomic conditions and combined with the rising risk of recession, have fueled outperformance for many dividend-paying stocks.”Sectors which are positioned to grow their dividends consistently include Energy, Packaged Food, Beverages and Household Products, Utilities, and Banks. Some of the best widow and orphan stocks to buy include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Our Methodology We selected the following widow and orphan stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and growing dividends over the last 30 years or more. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To BuyPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashBest Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy10. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of December 21: 4.98%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) was founded in 1901 and is based in Deerfield, Illinois. The company operates as an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retailer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and internationally. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has three segments – U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International, and U.S. Healthcare. The company paid a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on December 12 and has 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. On December 14, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $36 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst believes managed care and drug distributors' earnings visibility remains attractive, but she thinks hospitals have the most improved outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) at the end of September 2022, compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 6 million shares worth $186.5 million. In addition to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the best widow and orphan stocks to consider for a safe portfolio. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Dividend Yield as of December 21: 2.39%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational manufacturer of consumer products, operating through two segments – Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition. The company markets and sells its products under the Colgate, Darlie, Palmolive, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, EltaMD, Filorga, PCA SKIN, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, and Murphy brands, among others.

Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.55 million shares worth $811.3 million. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)6. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Dividend Yield as of December 21: 1.89%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an Illinois-based company that discovers, develops, and manufactures healthcare products worldwide.

On December 9, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, an 8.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.47. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 13. 2022 marks the company's 51st consecutive year of dividend growth.On December 12, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch raised the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $114 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Looking into 2023, ""many headwinds remain"" for the North America medical supplies and technology group, but these should ease in the second half of next year, alleviating operating margin pressures, the analyst wrote in a research noteAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 62 hedge funds were long Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a premier widow and orphan stock to buy. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Travel Stocks To Buy13 Best New Tech Stocks To Buy12 Best Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

13,90221fea-3e5d-34c3-be6b-7a36c860fb08,JWN,2022-12-23,Why Is Nordstrom (JWN) Down 23.4% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nordstrom-jwn-down-23-163004142.html,1671726604,STORY,['JWN'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nordstrom (JWN). Shares have lost about 23.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nordstrom due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Nordstrom Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat Estimates, Down Y/YNordstrom posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics fell from the year-ago quarter’s readings. Results gained from strength in core categories in men's and women's apparel and shoes, as customers returned to occasions, travel, work and holidays. Also, it remains on track with the Closer to You strategy, as well as supply-chain-optimization efforts.However, demand decelerated in late June, inducing Nordstrom to right-size its inventory and expenses in response to the current macroeconomic environment.Quarterly HighlightsNordstrom posted adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, down from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s 39 cents. However, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents per share.Total revenues of $3,546 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,521 million for the ninth straight quarter. However, the metric declined 2.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s figure due to the shift in the timing of the Anniversary sale, wherein a day of the sale was part of the third quarter of 2022. This had a 200-bps negative impact on sales.Net sales fell 2.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to $3,433 million and lagged our estimate of $4,373.1 million. Credit Card net revenues grew 9.7% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level to $113 million and came ahead of our estimate of $104.7 million.For third-quarter fiscal 2022, net sales for the Nordstrom brand decreased 3.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s number to $2,264 million and fell below our estimate of $3,106.7 million.Sales for the Nordstrom Rack brand dipped 1.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $1,169 million and lagged our estimate of $1,307.9 million. This was mainly due to muted demand, particularly from lower-income customers. As a result, Nordstrom Rack reduced store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount for free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com. These actions led to lesser order cancellations, simplified rack operations and improved profitability. Going ahead, it continues focusing on introducing more premium brands at Rack, better assortment and increased brand awareness.Digital sales plunged 16.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading due to the shift in the timing of the Anniversary Sale, which had a 300-bps headwind on digital sales. For the fiscal third quarter, digital sales represented 34% of net sales. Also, the metric was hurt by a channel shift as customers return to store shopping.Nordstrom's gross profit margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 33.2% for the reported quarter due to higher markdowns.SG&amp;A expense, as a percentage of sales, expanded 200 bps to 36.4% due to supply-chain technology and a related asset impairment charge, partly offset by reduced fulfillment expense. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were flat with the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level at 34.3% for the fiscal third quarter.Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $3 million reflected growth from $127 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter. The decrease mainly resulted from higher markdowns, supply-chain technology and a related asset impairment charge, offset by fulfillment expense efficiencies. Adjusted EBIT was $73 million, down 42.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading in the reported quarter.Story continuesOther FinancialsNordstrom ended third-quarter fiscal 2022 with available liquidity worth $993 million as of Oct 29, 2022, including $293 million of cash and cash equivalents.

14,f99ba7fc-9d82-3d6a-92c5-ee1d1082d964,UAA,2022-12-23,Under Armour names Marriott’s Stephanie Linnartz as new CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/under-armour-names-marriott-stephanie-205555438.html,1671742555,VIDEO,"['UA', 'UAA']","[Yahoo Finance Live looks to Under Armour's stock after naming its new incumbent CEO.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: Current Marriott International president Stephanie Linnartz will now be Under Armour's new chief executive. Linnartz has been at Marriott for over 25 years and comes to Under Armour with little retail experience. Wall Street analysts a bit mixed on the reaction there with the stock. Wells Fargo lowering its price target from $20 to $14. Baird and Telsey upping their target slightly to $10 and $11 respectively.But really, I want to focus on what one analyst had to say here, Dave. David Swartz at Morningstar said he has fair value on shares at $15.50. And he likes the move because it reminds him of what Nike did with CEO John Donahoe in 2020. And that's because of the new CEO here for Under Armour's experience in digital sales and digital marketing. That's an area Nike grew a ton over the last two years somewhere where Under Armour's sort of been lagging. I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, there's a lot of ways they are trailing Nike, needless to say. But what we learned in this most recent quarterly report from Nike is the real asset probably is the thing they're executing the best is digitally. They know exactly when, where, and why you're buying your shoes. And that is a huge advantage over competitors. Also like a couple of competitors in naming a female CEO. Dick's and Foot Locker also in that space, long dominated by male CEOs. That's nice to see as well.JARED BLIKRE: I'll tell you what, you want to look at the digital divide? I've got a chart looking at this on the YFi Interactive. And this goes back to the 2000s, since the IPO. This is UAA in its heyday here. And this is trying to struggle with the digital divide. It's basically been in a sideways trading range for the last five years. Now it sits at the lower end. So pretty bleak technical picture there. A turnaround strategy would be very welcome.]"

The opening bell on Wall Street just a few moments away. So let's hit a few Yahoo Finance trending tickers on this Thursday morning. Search is over for Under Armour's next CEO after the company hired Marriott's president Stephanie Linnartz to take the helm.Really, I would say, good hire. Stephanie has been on with us numerous times. She was really instrumental in driving the rewards program over there at Marriott, but also struck a lot of key, I believe, NFL and sports deals for Marriott, which will, of course, benefit her at Under Armour.I know she is very excited about taking this position. She will start at the end of February. Good hire, Under Armoour. And really, I think she's going to be missed a lot by Marriott. CEO Tony Capuano putting out a very classy press release yesterday, just explaining the departure and everything she has meant to the company.BRAD SMITH: I think this is a great hire for Under Armour. I mean, you've seen within the athleisure space, of course, that more of the companies in the athletic apparel and footwear category that are continually trying to increase their touch base with women and with a core purchaser, especially not just for the household, but especially within athletic apparel and footwear.And we've seen that across Lululemon, Nike shifted their strategy over the past couple of years as well. And so for Under Armour, perhaps its next leg of growth can continue to really glean the insights of exactly how it can tap better into some of its core customers and where.I think this is also signaling is just another effort to make sure that there are more women who are holding CEO positions in the S&amp;P 500. Only 33 companies in the S&amp;P 500 as of December 2022, which is about 6.6% of the S&amp;P 500, have female CEOs.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and as you can see, of the Fortune 500, it's, what, something like 44 right now. It's up 7%, but 44 out of 500 is still not a great percentage. I wanted to mention as well, you guys are sort of echoing what a lot of analysts are saying in terms of this being a good pick. But let's also be clear, she's got her work cut out for her.BRIAN SOZZI: Absolutely.JULIE HYMAN: Right? Like, this is not going to be an easy job. You saw what the stock has done over the past year. And Patrik Frisk, the former CEO, cut costs, tried to get things back in shape, didn't quite get it there. And as always, there is the added trick of working for Kevin Plank, right? Whenever you are at a company and you're the CEO, and the founder, chairman is still hanging around, that does add a little bit of a layer of complexity here. So we'll see how this all plays out.BRIAN SOZZI: Kevin is a very big personality. He's also still a very large shareholder in Under Armour. So best believe he is going to have influence on this company. But if he wants to start turning this brand around finally, he's going to have to let Stephanie just take the reins and lead the business like she wants to lead. And she deserves to lead, given 25+ year successfully at Marriott.BRAD SMITH: Broadly, on the whole, hopefully that there are more transitions like this where you do have more representation on a gender basis across the S&amp;P 500, across the markets, more broadly. Especially as recently as a couple of years back, NASDAQ put into place the diversity rule for their companies. Perhaps that creates more of a pipeline going forward.JULIE HYMAN: And it got a lot of backlash for that rule, by the way.BRAD SMITH: It did. It did, yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Which is amazing to me that that is still controversial at this point in time.]"

MAA and Sun Communities, Inc. SUI.Industry: Residential REITLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2030860/3-residential-reits-to-consider-despite-industry-challengesThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential Industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of soft rental housing demand amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation despite job gains and wage growth. Elevated deliveries and regulatory issues are also expected to add to the woes. Moreover, a hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Nevertheless, residential REITs like Equity Residential, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and Sun Communities, Inc. are poised to benefit as mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option. Also, residential REITs are banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of their operating platform.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs also focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region.Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, the enrollment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Weak New-Lease Apartment Demand: The inflationary environment and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely to have an adverse impact on this industry's performance. In fact, despite growth in jobs and wages, new-lease apartment demand remains weak amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation. In addition, there is a seasonality impact during winter months. With leasing traffic remaining soft, apartment rents are likely to bear the brunt .Elevated Deliveries of New Units: Although supply-chain woes and labor challenges have impacted construction activity to some extent in recent quarters, deliveries of new units are likely to accelerate in a number of markets in the upcoming quarters as the ongoing construction activity remains high, resulting in a struggle on the part of landlords to lure renters.Per a RealPage report, the U.S. apartment market is on course to add almost 3,300 communities, comprising around 590,000 units in 2023. This marks the largest delivery volume since RealPage started tracking the U.S. apartment market 30 years ago. Although construction costs are up, landlords have been able to pass on the burden to renters, who are supported by wage growth to absorb cost increases through rent hikes.Rent Control and Higher Interest Rates: The rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In fact, in recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs' power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees.Moreover, the hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes. However, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option.Rebound in Demand for Student Housing Properties: There has been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. Per a RealPage report, for fall 2023, already more than a quarter of student beds are pre-leased.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend, and now residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, as well as enhancing customer experience. The REITs are now focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in process and process enhancements. Improvement in search and tour booking as well as smart home access has gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on these.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's growth potential. Since August 2022, the industry's FFO per share estimate for 2022 has moved marginally down. Moreover, over the past year, the industry's FFO per share estimate for 2023 has moved 1.0% south.However, before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 33.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 19.4% and the broader Finance sector's decline of 14.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.16X compared with the S&amp;P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 16.99X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector's forward 12-month P/E of 13.02X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.48X, as low as 15.16X, with a median of 18.96X.3 Residential REIT Stocks Trying to Survive Industry ChallengesEquity Residential: Based in Chicago, IL, this residential REIT is one of the leading, publicly-traded multi-family REITs in the United States.It is well-positioned to benefit from its portfolio rebalancing efforts and a strong balance sheet. Equity Residential's efforts to diversify its portfolio in the urban and suburban markets, with an affluent tenant base, bode well.Its strategic buyouts and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform act as tailwinds.Currently, EQR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2022 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates revised marginally upward over the past two months to $3.53. The company's shares have declined 12.3% so far in the quarter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mid-America Apartment Communities: Headquartered in Germantown, TN, and commonly known as MAA, this residential REIT is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Mid-America Apartment's well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. The favorable in-migration trends of jobs and households in SunBelt submarkets are likely to fuel demand.We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues going forward. The prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to expand margins. Its solid balance sheet acts as a tailwind.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The recent trend in estimate revision indicates a favorable outlook for MAA. Particularly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share has been revised 1.4% upward over the past month to $8.46.Also, the consensus mark for 2023 FFO per share has moved 0.3% north over the past month to $9.17. The company's shares have declined 0.6% so far in the quarter.Sun Communities, Inc.: The Southfield, MI-based residential REIT enjoys a stake in or is engaged in the ownership or operation of manufactured housing communities, recreational vehicle (RV) resorts and marina properties across 39 states, Canada, Puerto Rico and the UK.This REIT is poised to benefit from its growth efforts in manufactured housing, RV resorts and marinas. The continued demand for affordable housing is acting as a tailwind, while demand for RV vacations is picking up pace amid the resumption of normalcy. Sun Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share has been revised 1.1% upward in the past month. The company's shares have increased 2.6% so far in the quarter.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

It started on an encouraging note, with the Federal Reserve ending the low-interest rate regime (at present, the short-term interest rates are at a 15-year high of 4.50%) to control persistent inflation. After two years of COVID-19-related mayhem and ambiguity, banks witnessed robust improvement in the lending scenario. These factors, along with initiatives taken to support fee income, majorly supported their top-line growth.But as the year progressed, several other macroeconomic and geopolitical matters, including global supply-chain disruptions and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, wreaked havoc with investors’ confidence. Also, as inflation turned out to be more “sticky” than expected, the central bank was forced to take unprecedented measures to tackle the same. This ultra-aggressive monetary policy stance has led market participants to expect an economic slowdown or recession in 2023.These headwinds turned investors bearish toward the banking stocks. So far this year, the S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index has declined 17.4%. Almost all banks lost value this year, with some less impacted than others. Today, we will discuss the three best-performing S&amp;P 500 banks – Regions Financial Corporation RF, M&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated HBAN – of 2022.Before we proceed to check out these three top-performing banks in detail, let’s see how they have fared. The chart below shows the price performance of these banks in the year-to-date period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegions FinancialRegions Financial is a Birmingham, AL-based financial holding company providing retail and commercial and mortgage banking, and other financial services. RF operates through four business segments – Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, Wealth Management and Others.Regions Financial keeps exploring opportunities for bolt-on buyouts, primarily in mortgage servicing rights, besides adding capabilities in the wealth management division. As the company is committed to diversifying its revenue streams, such endeavors will likely support growth in the long term.Further, Regions Financial’s asset-sensitive position will benefit majorly from the rising rate environment. Its acquisition of EnerBank, strong lending pipeline and strategic asset growth are expected to contribute to net interest income (NII) increase.Regions Financial has a solid balance sheet position. Its robust cash position shows the ability to meet debt obligations if the economic situation worsens. The company’s strong balance sheet and consistent earnings make its capital-deployment activities sustainable. The bank has a dividend yield of 3.86% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 13.4%. At present, RF's payout ratio is 37% of earnings.The stock has lost 3.4% so far this year. While the company’s earnings are projected to witness a year-over-year decline of 6.4% this year, the same is expected to rise 6.7% for 2023. The company currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Story continuesM&amp;T BankM&amp;T Bank Corporation, headquartered in Buffalo, NY, is the holding company for M&amp;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, National Association. MTB operates in New York, MD, New Jersey, PA, Delaware, CT, Virginia, WV and the District of Columbia.Organic growth, driven by higher fee income, rising rates and solid loans and deposits, will likely continue leading to revenue growth for MTB. The company is growing inorganically backed by a sound liquidity position. The acquisition of People's United Financial (completed April 2022) for $8.3 billion is expected to be accretive to its earnings and realize cost savings of $330 million by early 2023.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company seems to be well-positioned in terms of its liquidity profile and is likely to be able to continue meeting its debt obligations if the economic situation worsens. Also, the bank has come a long way in displaying its capital strength, as indicated by its impressive capital deployment activities. The company has a dividend yield of 3.42% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 8.9%. Also, MTB's payout ratio is 36% of earnings at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the year-to-date period, MTB stock has declined 6.9%. For 2022 and 2023, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 4.6% and 34.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Huntington BancsharesColumbus, OH-based Huntington Bancshares is a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company. Its inorganic expansion moves and growth in loans and deposits balance are expected to drive long-term growth.Over the past years, Huntington Bancshares has expanded its footprint with a number of acquisitions. In 2021, it closed the merger with TCF Financial Corporation, thus becoming one of the top 25 U.S. bank holding companies. The company is also expanding via acquisitions to bolster its fee income and digital capabilities. Such steps have strengthened HBAN’s position in existing markets and established a presence in new markets.With the Fed aggressively raising interest rates and expectations of a similar stance in the near term, Huntington’s NII is expected to witness robust growth. Also, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) bank has a steady capital deployment plan in place. HBAN has a dividend yield of 4.5% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 6.4%. Also, the company’s payout ratio is 43% of earnings at present.So far this year, the stock has declined 9.2%. For 2022 and 2023, the company’s earnings are projected to rise 36.1% and 5.8%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I think the focus for markets in the first half of the year is really around earnings,"" Osman said.U.S. stock index futures were little changed.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is set for a drop of more than 18% this year, its worst such performance since the global financial crisis of 2008.FED FAVOURITEThe release on Friday before Wall Street's opening bell of U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data, often dubbed the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, will be closely watched.It will give further indications of whether the rise in prices is continuing to moderate, even if more Fed rate rises are expected in 2023.Economists polled by Reuters expect the core PCE price index to rise 0.2% for November, while predicting a 4.7% rise for the year through November.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed will deliver more hikes in 2023 even as the economy slips towards a recession.In Asia, China stocks eased 0.3%, while Hong Kong stocks fell 0.4% as China grapples with soaring COVID-19 infections, in the wake of Beijing dismantling its strict zero-COVID policy to contain the virus.In the currency market, the Japanese yen was up 0.2% versus the dollar to 132.640. It is on track for its third largest weekly gain this year of more than 3%, after the central bank stunned markets on Tuesday by tweaking its policy on government bonds.""Investors should prepare themselves for rapid yen appreciation against the dollar once the market sees monetary policy in Japan and the U.S. flipping direction,"" Mizuho analysts said.Data on Friday showed Japan's core consumer inflation in November hit a fresh 40-year high, fuelling market expectations that Japan's central bank will further roll back its massive stimulus next year.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six peers, was slightly weaker at 104.34.The euro was slightly firmer at $1.060. Sterling was last trading at $1.2048, little changed on the day.Meanwhile, oil prices rose on expectations of lower Russian crude exports from the Baltic region in December.U.S. crude rose 1.3% to $78.52 per barrel and Brent was at $81.92, up 0.9% on the day.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Edwina Gibbs)]"

Both benchmarks recorded their biggest weekly gains since October.Russia may cut oil output by 5% to 7% in early 2023 as it responds to price caps, the RIA news agency cited Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak as saying on Friday.Russia's Baltic oil exports could fall by 20% in December from the previous month after the European Union and G7 nations imposed sanctions and a price cap on Russian crude from Dec. 5, according to traders and Reuters calculations.""The potential cut from Russia could be giving the bulls more fuel,"" said Eli Tesfaye, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. ""If global demand continues at current pace, that cut could have a significant impact and we may stay in the $80s range.""Both crude oil demand and output could slump over the next few days due to shut-ins from a massive winter storm that cascaded across a broad swath of the United States.

This is about 5-7% for us,"" he said.Novak, who negotiates with the OPEC group of major oil producers on Russia's behalf, described the cuts as ""insignificant"", but still a potential squeeze on global crude supplies.""We'll try to find some common ground with our counterparts to prevent such risks,"" the government official said, according to a Bloomberg report.""But right now, we'd rather take a risk of a production cut than stick to the policy of selling in line with the threshold.""The European Union and the G7 group of countries – the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK – capped the price of Russian oil at $60 a barrel earlier this month.Refiners, traders, and financers won't be allowed to handle Russian oil unless it was priced below that level, while tankers will be denied insurance unless they trade Russian crude at or under $60 a barrel.The EU has also banned seaborne imports of Russian crude in a bid to reduce the Kremlin's energy revenues and its funding of its ongoing war on Ukraine.Russia's oil exports tumbled 54% in the first full week since the US ban came into effect in early December, data from Bloomberg showed.Story continuesRussia has said it will retaliate against those measures by refusing to do business with any country that agrees to cap oil prices at the $60 a barrel level.Novak said the decree promised by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday to respond to western sanctions will bring in those measures and is close to being completed.""As for the price ceiling, a presidential decree is being prepared now.

I think the focus for markets in the first half of the year is really around earnings,"" Osman said.U.S. stock index futures were little changed.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is set for a drop of more than 18% this year, its worst such performance since the global financial crisis of 2008.FED FAVOURITEThe release on Friday before Wall Street's opening bell of U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data, often dubbed the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, will be closely watched.It will give further indications of whether the rise in prices is continuing to moderate, even if more Fed rate rises are expected in 2023.Economists polled by Reuters expect the core PCE price index to rise 0.2% for November, while predicting a 4.7% rise for the year through November.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed will deliver more hikes in 2023 even as the economy slips towards a recession.In Asia, China stocks eased 0.3%, while Hong Kong stocks fell 0.4% as China grapples with soaring COVID-19 infections, in the wake of Beijing dismantling its strict zero-COVID policy to contain the virus.In the currency market, the Japanese yen was up 0.2% versus the dollar to 132.640. It is on track for its third largest weekly gain this year of more than 3%, after the central bank stunned markets on Tuesday by tweaking its policy on government bonds.""Investors should prepare themselves for rapid yen appreciation against the dollar once the market sees monetary policy in Japan and the U.S. flipping direction,"" Mizuho analysts said.Data on Friday showed Japan's core consumer inflation in November hit a fresh 40-year high, fuelling market expectations that Japan's central bank will further roll back its massive stimulus next year.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six peers, was slightly weaker at 104.34.The euro was slightly firmer at $1.060. Sterling was last trading at $1.2048, little changed on the day.Meanwhile, oil prices rose on expectations of lower Russian crude exports from the Baltic region in December.U.S. crude rose 1.3% to $78.52 per barrel and Brent was at $81.92, up 0.9% on the day.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Edwina Gibbs)]"

Based on data from the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Authority (Bappebti), the number of registered crypto accounts hit 16.3 million as of September 2022, with a year-over-year growth rate of 81.6%.While the Central Bank of Indonesia sees some negative parts to crypto, such as the ability for it to operate as a ""shadow central bank,"" it knows it needs to work on keeping up, but also not getting in the way either, and with that it's developing a digital form of the Rupiah known as Project Garuda, Indonesia’s CBDC. At this point, crypto is too big in Indonesia to ban, so why not work with the industry and provide regulated payment layers, the prevailing logic goes.“[A] CBDC fills the gap left by existing money by acting as the core instrument for central banks to maintain monetary and financial system stability within digital ecosystem,” a whitepaper from the Bank on the CBDC reads.The bank envisions a market where crypto exists as part of a broader ecosystem, with on-ramps to and from CBDC.(Central Bank of Indonesia)“Activities within the Web 3.0 ecosystem, including crypto asset transactions, also add to the complexity of controlling financial systems, both in the context of mitigating micro-financial and macro-financial risks,” the paper reads. “Central banks would need to find a future-proof solution to maintain public trust in them with regards to carrying out their mandate in the digital era.”The Indonesian CBDC, according to the white paper, will be the method of settlement for traditional and digital ecosystem including DeFi, the metaverse and Web3. Cryptocurrency is fine, the prevailing thought seems to go, provided that a digital form of the Rupiah is the dominant means of settlement.This stands in contrast to China’s approach. The country has largely banned most kinds of cryptocurrencies and prohibits crypto transactions almost entirely. The People’s Bank of China white paper on its CBDC mentions cryptocurrency as a concern but takes particular issue with stablecoins, saying they will bring “risks and challenges” to the global financial system.But for Indonesia, stablecoins aren’t a problem. The country already has a handful of rupiah-backed stablecoins such as the BIDR, IDRT or IDK. A big market for these stablecoins is Indonesia’s large diaspora of migrant workers as overseas remittances is a big source of income for the country.In theory, a CBDC could be swapped for a stablecoin, then sent abroad. This method would also have the benefit of allowing authorities to monitor for tax compliance.Still, all this is a long way from being finalized. “The current whitepaper is still high level and theoretical and plans to be implemented,” Asih Karnengsih, chairwoman of Indonesia Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk. “The implementation of the CBDC will take many stakeholders to be involved and the real challenge will be how to invite these stakeholders to join the CBDC system.”But there are security risksA CBDC means that the government would have a lot of information on transactions and users. And Indonesia doesn’t have the best record for IT security.In January 2022, the Central Bank of Indonesia suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in 74.82 GB of data being leaked. A few months later the country’s national electoral commission was hacked, and the personal information of 105 million Indonesian citizens was sold on the dark web. This comes two years after the same department was hacked, resulting in a leak of 2.3 million voter records.Considering the government’s poor track record of IT security, is it really a good idea to give them so much more information? A CBDC would have details about every transaction a person makes. What price would that fetch on the dark web?CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried in FBI Custody, Former Associates Plead Guilty: Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang plead guilty to fraud charges in the FTX case, seeming to turn against their former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces similar charges.

For more brands, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Brands That Are Great Investments Now.Cover even a basic course in finance and you are likely to come across several different ways to value a company. These range from simple ratios to complex methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis which involves projecting a firm's cash flows into the future and then discounting them back to gain a sense of its fair value. Another popular, and easy, method is market capitalization, which simply multiplies the firm's outstanding shares with its share price.However, capturing the non-intrinsic value of a company - one that is determined by customer goodwill, corporate practices, and brand strength - is more difficult simply due to the qualitative nature of these factors. Calculating this value becomes crucial at the time of mergers or acquisitions, as the acquiring firm often ends up paying a premium for the target if the latter is a strong brand. This premium is called synergy during the acquisition phase, and its value is reflected as goodwill on the balance sheet of the acquiring entity. The balance sheet adjustment has to be made because the price paid for a firm is often higher than the value of its assets, and an adjustment is necessary to balance the 'balance' sheet.Today's piece will look at some of the most valuable brands in the world, and determine if they are also popular with hedge funds.

Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) which includes new applications, new approvals, rolling approvals, and rolling denials.

(NYSE:MSI)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-motorola-solutions-122701745.html,1671798421,STORY,['MSI'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.78bUS$1.98bUS$2.16bUS$2.39bUS$2.55bUS$2.69bUS$2.81bUS$2.92bUS$3.01bUS$3.09bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.97%Est @ 5.47%Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.69%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$53bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$53b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$25bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$255, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Motorola Solutions as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.071. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Motorola SolutionsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profit.What’s Price-to-Sales Ratio?While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investors’ favor, its price-to-sales could indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.AAR Corp. AIR, Signet Jewelers SIG, TravelCenters of America Inc. TA, DCP Midstream, LP DCP and ePlus inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy. A widow and orphan stock refers to an equity investment that pays a steady dividend and is generally considered to be low-risk, defensive, and non-volatile. These are usually large-cap, stable, and old-economy companies in non-cyclical business sectors. Dividends provide investors with a margin of safety despite the challenging environment for the capital markets, and dividend equities have outperformed non-dividend equities and bonds year-to-date.Investing in dividends, primarily those firms that increase their payouts on a year-over-year basis, can make massive contributions to long-term portfolio returns in an otherwise volatile market. Looking for the highest-yielding dividend stock is usually associated with higher risk. Investors should focus on picking up stocks which have a consistent track record of growing their dividends year after year. Nick Lentini of the Morgan Stanley Equity Strategy team said on November 9: “The investing backdrop of the past year, driven by macroeconomic conditions and combined with the rising risk of recession, have fueled outperformance for many dividend-paying stocks.”Sectors which are positioned to grow their dividends consistently include Energy, Packaged Food, Beverages and Household Products, Utilities, and Banks. Some of the best widow and orphan stocks to buy include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Our Methodology We selected the following widow and orphan stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and growing dividends over the last 30 years or more. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To BuyPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashBest Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy10. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of December 21: 4.98%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) was founded in 1901 and is based in Deerfield, Illinois. The company operates as an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retailer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and internationally. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has three segments – U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International, and U.S. Healthcare. The company paid a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on December 12 and has 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. On December 14, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $36 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst believes managed care and drug distributors' earnings visibility remains attractive, but she thinks hospitals have the most improved outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) at the end of September 2022, compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 6 million shares worth $186.5 million. In addition to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the best widow and orphan stocks to consider for a safe portfolio. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Dividend Yield as of December 21: 2.39%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational manufacturer of consumer products, operating through two segments – Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition. The company markets and sells its products under the Colgate, Darlie, Palmolive, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, EltaMD, Filorga, PCA SKIN, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, and Murphy brands, among others.

Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.55 million shares worth $811.3 million. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing.

(NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a premier widow and orphan stock to buy. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Travel Stocks To Buy13 Best New Tech Stocks To Buy12 Best Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

WBA is gaining from strategic collaborations and noteworthy product launches. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens Boots exited fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Retail comp sales in the United States and Boots UK were both strong, with the United States up 6% and Boots U.K. up 19% over fiscal 2021. Several of the company’s initiatives continued to gain traction. U.S. digital sales grew 37% in the fiscal year on top of 74% growth in 2021. myWalgreens membership crossed a big milestone, reaching 102 million customers.U.S. retail margin expanded 100 basis points, ahead of its competitors. The company also recognized meaningful contributions from alternative profit streams at $125 million in income for fiscal 2022, including Walgreen’s advertising group, with 35% growth. In the pharmacy, the company administered 35 million vaccinations in fiscal 2022, well beyond its expectations. Scripts volume was softer than expected in fiscal 2022. The company is now focusing on strategic investments to return about 3,000 stores to normal operating hours. This is expected to drive script volume recovery through fiscal 2023.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteWithin the U.S. Healthcare segment, the company is optimistic about the acquisition of CareCentrix. The latest accelerated deal, opting for full ownership in CareCentrix, is expected to position Walgreens Boots well in the home care market. According to the company, if the initial acquisition of a 55% stake had closed in line with the original timeframe, Walgreens Boots would have achieved its $3 billion to $3.2 billion sales goal in fiscal 2022.Added to this, VillageMD and Blue Shields continued to realize tremendous top-line growth in 2022, driving pro-forma total growth of 75% for the year.Story continuesStrategically, Walgreens Boots is committed to four priorities, to transform and align the core business; build its next growth engine, Walgreens Health; focus on its portfolio and optimize capital allocation; and build a high-performance culture and a winning team.In fiscal 2022, the company continued to progress in transforming the pharmacy business and the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. It is currently focused on labor investments on returning about 3,000 stores to normal operating hours, which is expected to result in an accelerated rebound in script volume into fiscal 2023.In line with its second strategy, the company’s decision to acquire the full stake in CareCentrix is aligned strategically. VillageMD and Blue Shields continued to realize tremendous top-line growth in 2022, driving pro-forma total growth of 75% for the year.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots’ fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings declined significantly on a year-over-year basis. Lower COVID-19 vaccination volumes in the reported quarter, macroeconomic headwinds and rising expenses impacted the bottom line. Fourth-quarter sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year-over-year basis, majorly impacted by a 660-bp impact from the anticipated sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens.According to the company, with inflation at a four-decade high, consumers are expressing uncertainty about the future and seeking value. Scripts volume remained soft due to temporary reductions in-store operating hours impacted by staffing shortages. Operating hour limitations impacted scripts by about 270 basis points in the fourth quarter, with a full-year impact of around 180 basis points.Further, in the last few years, the slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. In addition, of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margin on a significant level. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, gross profit fell 14.6% year over year. Gross margin contracted 214.2 bps to 19.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 10.1%. The company reported an adjusted operating loss of $909 million for the quarter under review compared to $854 million of operating profit in the year-ago period.Over the past year, Walgreens Boots has underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 24.2% compared with the industry’s 11.3% decline.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV, Orthofix Medical Inc.

The table may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding.In addition to reporting net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""EBITDA""), which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations’ performance period over period. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.Business OutlookOur outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023"") incorporates current assumptions and market conditions. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could alter our guidance. With consideration of these impacts, we have updated our guidance as follows:Total revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 8%;Management Solutions revenue is now anticipated to grow in the range of 7% to 8%;PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue is now anticipated to grow in the range of 5% to 7%;Interest on funds held for clients is now expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million;Other income is now anticipated to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million;Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) is now anticipated to grow in the range of 12% to 14%.Other aspects of our guidance for fiscal 2023 remain unchanged from what we provided previously.(1)Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a U.S. GAAP measure.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.45%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.05%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 5.88%.Heading into today, shares of the coffee chain had lost 0.85% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 2.29% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.68% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Starbucks as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Starbucks is projected to report earnings of $0.76 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.56%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.79 billion, up 9.19% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.42 per share and revenue of $35.99 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.54% and +11.61%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.4% higher within the past month. Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Starbucks currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 28.88. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.05.Story continuesMeanwhile, SBUX's PEG ratio is currently 2.09. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. SBUX's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.22 as of yesterday's close.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 173, which puts it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

64,207f4cd8-733c-3534-93ba-4ea258fbb8e4,SBUX,2022-12-23,The Loyalty Revolution,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loyalty-revolution-144809243.html,1671720489,STORY,['SBUX'],"[We all know loyalty and reward programs. In their simplest form, they are the punch card at your local coffee shop. Buy four and get the fifth one free. In their most complex form, they are an inscrutable and ever-changing formula for earning and redeeming rewards at some of the world’s largest brands in massive industries spanning aviation, hospitality and financial services. The complexity of these programs is so great that countless businesses have cropped up just to help consumers make sense of them.Loyalty programs are a way for businesses to encourage customer engagement and retention. There’s a common saying that the most profitable sale is one to the customer you already have. It’s more cost-effective to extend an existing customer’s LTV (lifetime value) than to go out and acquire a new one. This is increasingly true as paid acquisition channels have increased in cost and more of a business’ margin is going to large advertising intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Instagram.Tara Fung is the CEO and co-founder of Co:Create. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.But the versions of loyalty programs that we know and love (loathe?) are so limited. They live in walled gardens where the rewards you accrue often offer menial benefits and come with an overwhelming number of restrictions. You can only use these points on select items or at select times, the offering varies, the point-cost fluctuates, points can be devalued from one day to the next, you may be unable to transfer them to someone else (unless you pay exorbitant fees), and don’t even think about being able to monetize and sell the loyalty points you supposedly “earned.”Because these loyalty programs operate within closed systems, many of them don’t create loyalty as much as captivity.What is the cost to you as a consumer to “exit” a specific loyalty program and start all over? On the flip side, are you likely to even value the points you’ve earned when you don’t know if you’ll ever reach the membership tiers that unlock relevant benefits?Story continuesThese switching costs and commitment barriers greatly reduce value to consumers. It begs the question whether these points are ever truly yours to begin with, and if these loyalty micro-economies are a mirage.However, blockchains make alternative systems possible, where both brands and consumers can share bigger pieces of a larger pie. By tokenizing rewards, customers can own their loyalty, and brands can take advantage of composable technology that enables them to increase LTV [loan-to-value, a ratio] and lower customer acquisition costs (CAC).Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect | OpinionSo what could this look like?We have an early view offered by Starbucks’s newly revamped Web3 loyalty program, Odyssey. Individuals in the beta program can now earn tokenized rewards and redeem those rewards within the Starbucks app. Starbucks has shared plans to enable customers to sell those rewards on a Starbucks marketplace. This construct allows customers to own their loyalty in a way they haven’t been able to before.But for emergent and smaller brands – those focused on achieving growth with limited resources – it’s likely they will be more adventurous. They may be willing to band together to beat the big guys and take on potential risks for the promise of greater outcomes. This is the area that I look forward to most – both as a consumer and someone bullish on blockchain technology – to not only improve our current systems, but create new and better ones.What if some of these brands were to launch interoperable loyalty programs that provided more value to consumers by enabling points to be utilized across several merchants? This type of system would also allow merchants to strike novel partnerships with non-competitive brands that serve similar customer segments.In my own life, it’s easy for me to come up with examples of brands I’d love to see partner up, such as:Allbirds x CometeerSoho House x LululemonAthletic Greens x GlossierFrom these examples, you can likely guess my age, gender and demographic, but that is entirely the point. Personally, I would greatly value the ability to use Soho House credits at Lululemon, and it would undoubtedly result in me spending more across both businesses. The use of earned rewards feels markedly different than if Soho House were to email out a Lululemon discount code. Knowing I’m one of thousands being emailed the same promotion for “15% off” doesn’t hit the same way as being told that the loyalty tokens I’ve earned with one brand can be used with another to unlock rewards, discounts, store credit or limited edition drops.From the brand’s perspective, it benefits by increasing the value of its own loyalty program. As more uses for the loyalty token are added, the perceived value of them increases, which can draw in more consumers. Additionally, by using a new and open data standard (e.g., ERC-20), brands can agree to and launch these partnerships from one day to another as opposed to spending months developing and implementing data-sharing APIs among proprietary systems.This isn’t an entirely novel concept. We’ve seen conglomerates launch cross-brand loyalty programs to great success. What is new is the superior and more flexible technology that allows for the multi-merchant programs to be entered into and evolve rapidly, and in doing so take away many of the benefits of scale larger corporations have traditionally enjoyed.See also: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023 | OpinionSome may worry that tokenizing loyalty exposes a brand’s crown jewels to the world (and direct competitors): their customer data. Currently, the most commonly used blockchains are public blockchains that allow anyone to see transactions and account holdings. This is likely to change as the industry matures, data protection standards are developed, and zero-knowledge technology is advanced. Nonetheless, even now, in its current form, one could argue that the competitive risk presented by tokenizing loyalty is minimal for companies that serve their customers well. In the more well-known cases of vampire attacks, we see that these competitive strategies were often shortlived and minimally successful, with the majority of customers reverting back to the original platform.Without a doubt, there are many aspects of open loyalty programs that will need solutions, such as mechanisms to regulate healthy supply and demand dynamics so that individuals are not able to disproportionately earn from one merchant and redeem at another. Furthermore, this brave new world is likely to happen incrementally and iteratively versus all at once, beginning with brands using transfer restrictions to address some of these unanswered questions from return on investment (ROI) to regulatory uncertainty.Nonetheless, this change is coming. Blockchain technology will unlock new opportunities for smaller brands and consumers to share more value among each other rather than allowing that value to be captured by large advertising intermediaries. Progress is relentless, and this is one of the areas we will see it take hold.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy. A widow and orphan stock refers to an equity investment that pays a steady dividend and is generally considered to be low-risk, defensive, and non-volatile. These are usually large-cap, stable, and old-economy companies in non-cyclical business sectors. Dividends provide investors with a margin of safety despite the challenging environment for the capital markets, and dividend equities have outperformed non-dividend equities and bonds year-to-date.Investing in dividends, primarily those firms that increase their payouts on a year-over-year basis, can make massive contributions to long-term portfolio returns in an otherwise volatile market. Looking for the highest-yielding dividend stock is usually associated with higher risk. Investors should focus on picking up stocks which have a consistent track record of growing their dividends year after year. Nick Lentini of the Morgan Stanley Equity Strategy team said on November 9: “The investing backdrop of the past year, driven by macroeconomic conditions and combined with the rising risk of recession, have fueled outperformance for many dividend-paying stocks.”Sectors which are positioned to grow their dividends consistently include Energy, Packaged Food, Beverages and Household Products, Utilities, and Banks. Some of the best widow and orphan stocks to buy include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Our Methodology We selected the following widow and orphan stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and growing dividends over the last 30 years or more. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To BuyPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashBest Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy10. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of December 21: 4.98%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) was founded in 1901 and is based in Deerfield, Illinois. The company operates as an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retailer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and internationally. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has three segments – U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International, and U.S. Healthcare. The company paid a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on December 12 and has 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. On December 14, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $36 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst believes managed care and drug distributors' earnings visibility remains attractive, but she thinks hospitals have the most improved outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) at the end of September 2022, compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 6 million shares worth $186.5 million. In addition to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the best widow and orphan stocks to consider for a safe portfolio. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

It is one of the premier widow and orphan stocks to invest in. On December 6, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers raised the firm's price target on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to $87 from $85 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 55 in the prior quarter. The collective stakes in Q3 2022 increased to $4.13 billion from $2.93 billion in Q2. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.55 million shares worth $811.3 million. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)6. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Dividend Yield as of December 21: 1.89%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an Illinois-based company that discovers, develops, and manufactures healthcare products worldwide.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a premier widow and orphan stock to buy. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Travel Stocks To Buy13 Best New Tech Stocks To Buy12 Best Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

HuffstutterCHICAGO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc said it suspended and reduced operations at some U.S. meat facilities on Thursday due to a massive winter storm, while farmers increased checks on livestock facing harsh winds and cold.The extreme weather presented a temporary challenge to food production after consumers grappled this year with soaring inflation, supply-chain shortages and drought that seared farmland in the western United States.Tyson, which sells beef, pork and chicken and is the largest U.S. meat producer by sales, said it scaled back operations to protect employees and animals.""We are in close contact with our customers to minimize disruption and continue to fulfill customer orders,"" the company said.In Kansas, the third-largest U.S. cattle state behind Texas and Nebraska, the National Weather Service warned of ""dangerously cold"" wind chills reaching -40 Fahrenheit (-40 Celsius), though temperatures were expected to rise on Friday.Ranchers were constantly checking their cattle to make sure they were not in distress and had access to water that was not frozen, said Kansas Farm Bureau spokesman Greg Doering.""They will make it through,"" Doering said about cattle. ""This is an extreme event but it's going to be short lived.""In Douglas, North Dakota, farmer Daryl Lies said his family used farm machinery and snow blowers to clear paths between four-foot-tall snow drifts so their cattle could reach water, hay and shelter. They kept a close eye on hog barns to make sure animals inside remained warm.""It's 20 below without the windchill right now, and we’re better off than some,"" said Lies, president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. ""These winds will suck a lot of heat out fast.""Some Archer-Daniels-Midland grain facilities in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana closed early, the company said.Farmers showed little interest in making new deals to sell corn and soybeans, and were not delivering crops due to the bad weather, grain dealers said.Wheat farmers in the central Plains worried that frigid temperatures may kill or damage dormant crops that lack a protective layer of snow.

While recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. At this stage, one way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. CHEF, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS, Enphase Energy, Inc. ENPH, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Fabrinet FN are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified for the screening:Ridgefield, CT-based Chefs' Warehouse is engaged in the distribution of specialty food products. CHEF's product portfolio includes nearly 50,000 stock-keeping units, such as specialty food products, such as artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, truffles, caviar, chocolate and pastry products.Chefs' Warehouse’s 2023 earnings are projected to grow 9.7%. The company, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present, has witnessed a 16.7% upward revision in broker ratings over the past four weeks.Mountain View, CA-based Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation software for the semiconductor and electronics industries.

77,7e3a6557-76aa-3608-8e16-d55ad1a3e8aa,PM,2022-12-23,Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-nyse-130042546.html,1671714042,STORY,['PM'],"[A look at the shareholders of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 77% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Philip Morris International. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Philip Morris International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Philip Morris International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Philip Morris International Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$197m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Philip Morris International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Philip Morris International that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

WU’s dividend yield of 6.9% is significantly higher than the average of 0.8% for the industry. In the first nine months of 2022, Western Union returned $450 million capital to its shareholders. Its new $1-billion three-year share repurchase plan will run through the end of 2024.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that can hold the stock back. In the trailing 12-month period, free cash flows after dividends declined 27.4%. Despite facing an improving business environment, declining free cash flows can affect its future operations.Also, WU’s total debt-to-total capital of 83.2% at the third-quarter end was higher than the industry’s figure of 40.6%. Its high leverage ratio is concerning. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services space are PaySign, Inc.

82,4e7bb161-53b8-3913-aea9-758bdb8945c6,GS,2022-12-23,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:GS) Business And Shares Still Trailing The Market",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-nyse-120019285.html,1671796819,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") above 15x, you may consider The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) as an attractive investment with its 9.2x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.Goldman Sachs Group could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Goldman Sachs Group.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?Goldman Sachs Group's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 38% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 67% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 0.09% per year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per annum, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's understandable that Goldman Sachs Group's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Goldman Sachs Group's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.As we suspected, our examination of Goldman Sachs Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group  that you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

With nearly all the major indices around the world either in a bear market or hovering on the verge of one, most portfolios are ending the year deep in the red. Yet the holidays are a time for optimism and there is hope that these top stocks to buy will rebound in the New Year and that 2023 will be kinder to investors and their capital.Fortunately, there is historical precedence for a rebound in the coming year. Markets tend to recover strongly in the year after a decline of 20% or more, according to industry data. Investors want to be prepared to take advantage of any upturn and position their portfolio for growth no matter what 2023 brings. With that in mind, we offer the following seven stocks to buy before the holidays.MATMattel$16.39JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$175.92MSFTMicrosoft$241.56DECKDeckers Outdoor$364.14AMTAmerican Tower$209.50DKSDick’s Sporting$109.79PARAParamount Global$16.71Stocks to Buy: Mattel (MAT)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith toys a big part of year-end holidays. Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) is one of the top stocks to buy. The El Segundo, California-based company is the second-largest toy manufacturer in the world. Only the Lego Group in Denmark is bigger. Mattel is the brand behind some of the most iconic toys ever produced, from Barbie and Hot Wheels to American Girl and Bob the Builder. The toy sales that now stretch to more than 150 countries globally have led to nearly $6 billion in annual revenues at Mattel.Plus, Mattel is increasingly branching out to the world of entertainment with a line of films based on its popular toys. Between 2023 and 2025, Mattel is producing movies based on Barbie, Hot Wheels, Masters of the Universe, and even the Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. The movies are expected to be a new lucrative revenue stream for Mattel. Over the past year, MAT stock has been pulled lower along with the rest of the market. As 2022 draws to a close, Mattel’s share price is down 23% at $16.68 a share. There’s no dividend, but a price-earnings (P/E) ratio below 10 is attractive.Story continuesStocks to Buy: Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAlong with flu season, 2023 is seeing a resurgence of COVID-19 and other respiratory ailments. This has put a renewed spotlight on vaccine producers such as New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The pharma giant has forecast $3.5 billion in full-year 2022 sales of its one-shot COVID-19 vaccine. Sales are now ramping up with the onset of winter and the annual cold and flu season.Johnson &amp; Johnson also benefits from robust sales of several other medications used to treat diseases ranging from cancers to rheumatoid arthritis. While many other pharmaceutical companies also have blockbuster drug sales, Johnson &amp; Johnson benefits from a stable of popular consumer products that include Tylenol, Listerine, Band-Aid, and Polysporin. JNJ stock is up in 2022, having risen 2% to trade at $174 a share. A P/E ratio of 24 is reasonable and a quarterly dividend payment of $1.13 a share is nice.Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comSeattle-based Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another one of the most solid stocks to buy. Microsoft today is an increasingly diversified technology giant that analysts and investors remain bullish on despite the 2022 tech wreck. Video games and cloud computing increasingly make-up Microsoft’s business. And while its $68 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) has run into some regulatory headwinds, the company remains profitable and has returned nearly 200% to shareholders over the past five years.In 2022, MSFT stock has fallen 28% to $239 a share. However, the decline has more to do with poor investor sentiment toward the technology sector than with any structural or long-term issues at Microsoft itself. This remains a stock that still has a nearly $2 trillion market capitalization. The decline in the share price this year has brought its P/E ratio down to 25, and it pays a quarterly dividend of 68 cents, one of the few mega-cap tech stocks to share profits with stockholders. Wall Street analysts, including at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), continue to rate Microsoft’s stock a buy.Deckers Outdoor (DECK)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWhile Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is not a household name, the footwear it makes sure is. The Goleta, California-based company makes the popular Uggss brand of sheepskin slippers and shoes. It also manufactures the increasingly popular HOKA brand of running shoes. While little known to most people, Deckers Outdoor has been in business since 1973, and its footwear is sold in more than 50 countries, generating $2.5 billion in annual sales.Uggs got a nice boost during the pandemic and that momentum has carried through the reopening in 2022. With high-profit margins and strong cash flow, many analysts continue to see strong growth potential in Deckers Outdoor, noting that with only 138 company-owned retail stores there is plenty of room for future expansion.DECK stock is flat in 2022, down a slight 0.30% at $366 a share. Bank of America recently slapped a buy rating on Deckers Outdoor stock and a $425 per share price target, calling it a “high-quality stock with a compelling growth trajectory.” Bank of America’s price target is 16% higher than where the stock is trading as we close out 2022.American Tower (AMT)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comInvestors looking for exposure to fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology should consider American Tower (NYSE:AMT). The real estate investment trust (REIT) operates the wireless communications infrastructure on which 5G networks run. The company is essential to the growth of 5G wireless with more than 200,000 communications sites worldwide. AMT stock is down 27% in 2022 but analysts see an upside ahead. The median price target on AMT is $245, nearly 20% higher than where shares currently trade.AMT stock pays a decent quarterly dividend of $1.56 a share, which is good for a yield of 2.99%. The P/E ratio of 33 is a little high but not unreasonable for a tech stock of American Tower’s size. Beyond the U.S., American Tower’s business in Europe continues to grow at a strong rate due to partnerships with governments in countries such as Germany, Spain, and France. Long-term, American Tower’s share price should continue to grow alongside the expansion of 5G wireless services around the world.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is the largest retailer of sporting goods in America. It’s the type of business and stock that perform well in good economic times and bad. Established in 1948, Dick’s today is a well-known and popular brand in every region of the U.S. Some investors view it as a hedge against inflation as parents are often likely to buy soccer cleats or football pads for their children even if prices rise.This helps to account for the fact that DKS stock is only down 4% in 2022. At $110 a share, the stock has held up remarkably well in a tough market. The shares have certainly done better than many other retailers over the course of the last year. The company’s P/E ratio currently sits at 10, suggesting the stock is undervalued relative to many of its peers. And it pays a healthy quarterly dividend of 49 cents a share. While there are some concerns about high inventory levels at Dick’s Sporting Goods, the company should be able to weather that issue and any others that arise in 2023, making this a definite stock to buy before the holidays.Paramount Global (PARA)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comLegendary investor Warren Buffett has added several new stocks to his portfolio amid this year’s market selloff, and one of his newest additions has been entertainment giant Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). Over the course of 2022, Buffett has purchased more than 90 million shares of PARA stock, bringing his investment to $1.54 billion. The Oracle of Omaha has continued buying Paramount Global stock as the price has declined and now owns 10% of the company.Formerly known as “ViacomCBS,” Paramount Global owns a number of impressive assets, including the Paramount film studio and the CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, and Comedy Central television networks. It also owns the streaming service Paramount+. The film studio had a banner year in 2022, producing major box office hits such as Top Gun: Maverick, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and The Lost City.Sadly, PARA stock slumped 48% in 2022 to trade at $16 a share. The stock’s P/E ratio is currently 3.70, making it look woefully undervalued when compared to the average P/E of 16 among companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index. Take a cue from Warren Buffett and buy shares of this entertainment juggernaut while they’re on sale.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and MS.

Improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level have been tailwinds for the insurance industry. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates and an improving rate environment have also added to the upside.The insurance industry has declined 0.4% year to date compared with the Finance sector’s decrease of 16.5% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decline of 21.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere are four insurance stocks that have managed to perform well so far this year backed by their strong fundamentals.  Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. KNSL and American International Group, Inc. AIG have outperformed the industry, the sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite year to date. These stocks are poised to retain the rally, given solid prospects.Factors at PlayPer Global Insurance Market Index released by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 6% in the third quarter of 2022. It marked the 20th consecutive quarter of price increases. Per the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate premium growth of 2.1% on average over the next two years. A declining level of inflation, solid life insurance demand and market hardening in property and casualty lines should continue to support the growth.An expanded distribution, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal, price increases, the appointment of retail agents, and a solid balance sheet have boosted insurers’ momentum. The insurance industry players are well poised for growth on the back of higher new business premiums, growth in the line of business, increase in agency renewal written premiums, improving return on equity and non-cat property losses, and expanding international business.Diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk, is also a positive. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, benefited sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, global life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023.The property and casualty insurance industry remains exposed to severe weather events that make underwriting results and in turn earnings volatile. Per Swiss Re Institute, natural catastrophe activity has resulted in insured losses of $115 billion in so far 2022, which is higher than the 10-year average of $81 billion. Swiss Re estimated Hurricane Ian as the most expensive one with estimated preliminary insured losses of $50 billion to $65 billion. Nevertheless, prudent underwriting, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development have helped to maintain underwriting profitability.A near-zero interest rate environment concerns insurers as it weighs on investment income, one of the important components of insurers’ top line. A larger invested base, directing funds to alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, is expected to drive the metric in the future. Seven rate hikes have been implemented by the Fed so far in 2022. In the last monetary policy meeting of 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 bps to the range of 4.25 to 4.5%.A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions, invest in growth initiatives, engage in share buybacks, and increase dividends or pay out special dividends. Mergers and alliances boost portfolios, diversify operations into new business lines and geography and have enabled them to enter more profitable market segments. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, the insurance industry witnessed 427 completed deals in the first half of 2022, which increased 16% year over year.The insurance industry players continue to invest in technology like robotic process automation, Chatbot and RoboAdvisory, artificial intelligence and data analytics, insurtech solutions, telematics, cloud computing. These investments have expedited business operations, enhanced internal efficiency and bolstered data and analytics capabilities and saveed costs which in turn will benefit margins.Story continuesSolid Picks for Better ReturnsWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected four insurance stocks that rallied year to date and are poised to retain the momentum next year.Pembroke, Bermuda, Arch Capital Group is a leading specialty P&amp;C and mortgage insurer and offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance worldwide.

AIG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $5 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for American International shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, American International is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Insurance - Multi line industry that ranks in the Top 17% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.17 per share to $1.11 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about American International right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

For more brands, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Brands That Are Great Investments Now.Cover even a basic course in finance and you are likely to come across several different ways to value a company. These range from simple ratios to complex methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis which involves projecting a firm's cash flows into the future and then discounting them back to gain a sense of its fair value. Another popular, and easy, method is market capitalization, which simply multiplies the firm's outstanding shares with its share price.However, capturing the non-intrinsic value of a company - one that is determined by customer goodwill, corporate practices, and brand strength - is more difficult simply due to the qualitative nature of these factors. Calculating this value becomes crucial at the time of mergers or acquisitions, as the acquiring firm often ends up paying a premium for the target if the latter is a strong brand. This premium is called synergy during the acquisition phase, and its value is reflected as goodwill on the balance sheet of the acquiring entity. The balance sheet adjustment has to be made because the price paid for a firm is often higher than the value of its assets, and an adjustment is necessary to balance the 'balance' sheet.Today's piece will look at some of the most valuable brands in the world, and determine if they are also popular with hedge funds. The top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 Comeback Stocks. CNBC’s Jim Cramer mentioned beaten down tech stocks on November 22, which he believes can make a drastic comeback after the Federal Reserve stops its fiscal tightening. He also expects that there are many pure pandemic stocks that potentially cannot recover from this year’s lows. In 2022, the biggest and most prominent growth stocks on Wall Street, including the likes of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), “crashed and burned”, as Cramer puts it. However, Jim Cramer noted that most of the high-quality tech names which were hammered due to the Fed’s unstoppable rate hikes this year are the ones which have led the digital transformation journey for the world and multiple industries are dependent on them. He told investors: “Nearly all of these, save Apple, are variations on the same story — stocks that were cut in half when their businesses had no such comedowns. Their stocks just got way ahead of themselves before the Fed took away that easy money.”While consistent inflation, rampant interest rate hikes, COVID-19 lockdowns in China, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led investors to dump risky tech stocks and pile into safer bets, Cramer explained his rationale for future stock picking:“Once the Fed relents, I’d much rather be in Big Tech, or the top cloud plays, or the better-run chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia.” Our Methodology We explored the 10 tech stocks that Jim Cramer said can make a comeback on a November 22 segment of CNBC’s Mad Money. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Jim Cramer's 10 Comeback StocksJim Cramer's Comeback Stocks10. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, energy generation solutions, and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally. On December 19, local news outlets disclosed that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is set to announce a new Gigafactory in Mexico with an initial investment of up to $1 billion. Story continuesWhile Cramer backed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of November, investors are watching the stock closely as the selling pressure has amped up over the last few weeks. Although the stock traded a new multi-year low of $135.89 on December 15, some long-term Wall Street bulls are seeing value in the lowered price.On December 22, Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas maintained a Buy recommendation on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $275 from $304. The analyst noted the latest decline in the shares is the worst in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s history. He said while present fundamentals appear fairly uncertain, he sees potential green shoots in 2023 and sustained extraordinary growth beyond to help improve equity performance.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 88 hedge funds were bullish on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4 million shares worth $1.08 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of Jim Cramer’s favorite comeback stocks. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic; second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)9. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a California-based company that provides enterprise cloud applications in the United States and internationally. It is one of the tech names that Jim Cramer believes will make a comeback, as the underlying business fundamentals remain robust. On November 29, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) announced that its board approved a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $500 million in common shares. The new share repurchase program is meant to lessen the impact of future share dilution from employee stock issuances.On December 20, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill raised the price target on Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) to $235 from $225 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst noted that the appointment of Carl Eschenbach as co-CEO is a ""very strong"" addition to the leadership team and can also ""open additional doors"" for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s database, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) was part of 92 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, up from 71 in the earlier quarter. Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5 million shares worth $764 million. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Workday, Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added a small position in Workday this quarter, taking advantage of its 2022 price decline. WDAY is a leading SaaS software solutions provider with two key subparts: Workday HCM offering end-to-end software for human resource departments, and Workday Financial Management for planning, spending, auditing, analytics, and reporting. The company sells to more than 9,500 medium-sized through enterprise customers across more than 175 countries, including more than 50% of the Fortune 500.The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for businesses and despite its 21% annual subscription revenue CAGR over the past 2 years (with 95%+ gross revenue retention), Workday still has less than 5% penetration of its $105 billion TAM. We believe the company can grow its top-line high-teens over the long-term, while continuing to improve margins (non-GAAP gross operating margin expanded 900 basis points to 22.4% over the past two years), leading to approximately 30% EPS growth for the foreseeable future. The company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF ($1.4b last year, up 37% year over year), which WDAY has used for acquisitions and debt repayment.”8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a ​​California-based diversified software company that operates through three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the Jim Cramer comeback stocks to monitor. Adobe stock climbed 3% on December 16 as Wall Street became enthusiastic for the company’s business outlook and fiscal fourth-quarter results. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) expects to announce earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.70 for the fiscal first quarter of 2023, with revenue in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.64 billion.On December 16, Stifel analyst J. Parker Lane raised the price target on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) to $400 from $375 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares after the company delivered ""a clean finish to FY22, highlighted by a record net new Digital Media quarter."" After management reaffirmed the guidance it laid out for FY23 at its analyst day in October, the analyst believes investors will remain focused on the regulatory approval process for the Figma acquisition and the likely impact to the product pipeline once the deal has been concluded later in the year.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 93 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 92 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 5.14 million shares worth $1.4 billion. Jackson Square Partners made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two significant actions taken in the quarter were the exit of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and the initiation of Boeing. Adobe paid a price to acquire a competitor called Figma ($22B) that we could not justify even under the most bullish fundamental outlook. It struck us as desperate, defensive, and reactive. After reassuring investors for many quarters that Figma was not having a negative competitive impact on its business, to us this was a clear admission of the opposite. While a more optimistic interpretation could be that Figma is a good asset, Adobe just got rid of a competitor, and the day 1 stock reaction already wiped out more than $22B from Adobe’s market cap – we saw too many red flags potentially signaling worsening trends to come in Adobe’s core. It is also not obvious to us why Figma sails through anti-trust clearance, which if the deal is not allowed to proceed would leave a gaping exposure as Adobe just showed its hand.”7. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based company that offers enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, consolidate, manage, and automates services for enterprises worldwide. The cloud-computing software company outperformed analyst estimates with its third quarter earnings. It is one of the top picks of Jim Cramer as a comeback tech stock. Baird analyst Rob Oliver on December 21 maintained a Neutral rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $475 from $500. The analyst noted the company presented at several competitor conferences and said he now feels they are well positioned despite macro constraints. He reduced his 2023 estimates to factor in macro weakness, and introduced 2024 estimates slightly below consensus but said he is warming up to the stock.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 103 hedge funds were long ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), compared to 99 funds in the prior quarter. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.7 million shares worth nearly $640 million. Lakehouse Capital made the following comment about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Despite a challenging environment, US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) performed well and reported revenues of $1.8 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year in constant currency terms. The company’s operational metrics continue to be resilient, with remaining performance obligations growing 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms, total customers with over $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) growing 22%, and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. Performance was evenly spread across segments, products, and geographies, with notable strength in the US federal, which had its best quarter ever including a $20 million-plus net new ACV win. The company now boasts 1,530 customers generating in excess of $1 million in ACV, which is pleasing to see as it implies multiple solutions are involved and that the company’s platform model is increasingly resonating with customers. We continue to believe that ServiceNow is one the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it a compelling opportunity.”6. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the comeback stocks on Jim Cramer’s list. On December 22, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced that it plans to buy Fort Monmouth’s Mega Parcel for $55 million to construct a state-of-art production facility. The company said it will invest upwards of $850 million to create one of the largest media production facilities in the world. Netflix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals were two of our top contributors. Shares of Netflix got some relief after being under pressure in the first half of 2022. Media and entertainment stocks in general have been out of favor as investors grapple with the long-term economics of streaming services and slowing subscriber growth—what should be viewed as a normal feature of a maturing market. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe Netflix will be among this group. We initiated our position in Netflix in Q1 after shares fell by more than half due to concerns about subscriber growth and increasing competition from streaming upstarts. The stock then suffered a second down leg in April after the company reported subscriber losses for the first time in its history. Then in July, the company reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses, but the nearly 1 million subscribers lost were much lower than the 2 million that management had forecast, and shares rallied on the news. For patient investors, there is reason for optimism that subscriber growth will turn around. The company has plans to crack down on password sharing and is launching a lower cost advertising supported tier. Our investment case is focused on an undemanding valuation, massive scale, a continued shift in time and attention from linear TV to streaming, and a financial condition which gives management the flexibility to operate unconstrained during a transition period for the business. We also believe Netflix can leverage its massive global scale of 200+ million subscribers into positive free cash flow through steady pricing increases and content spending controls.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Comeback Stocks.

In November, about 9% of Netflix’s U.S. subscriber sign-ups were for the $6.99/month ad-supported package, making it the least popular among its plan options, according to an analysis released this week by research firm Antenna. By comparison, when HBO Max launched its ad-supported option in June 2021, 15% of the streamer’s U.S. sign-ups that month were for HBO Max With Ads.In addition, Antenna found that 0.2% of existing HBO Max’s U.S. subscribers switched to the ad-supported plan in June 2021, compared with 0.1% for existing Netflix users in November 2022. The firm noted that HBO Max With Ads plan did pick up steam, accounting for up to nearly one-third of sign-ups in its first year, and that today about 21% of HBO Max subscribers are on the ad-supported plan.Why is Netflix’s ad tier seemingly having a slow liftoff? One reason could be that the plan has several notable restrictions compared with Netflix’s ad-free offerings. Netflix Basic With Ads excludes some popular TV series and movies, including “House of Cards,” “New Girl” and “The Good Place,” for which Netflix does not currently have rights to serve advertising. (Netflix says 5%-10% of total titles are unavailable in the ad tier, depending on market.) In addition, subscribers on the ad-supported plan, which serves up about 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour of content, can’t download titles for offline viewing. The service also is limited to a single 720p HD stream at a time (as is the case for Netflix Basic without ads).According to Netflix, Antenna’s data is not accurate, although Netflix did not provide its own sign-up figures for the ad plan. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan. 19.Story continues“It’s still very early days for our ad-supported tier and we’re pleased with its launch and engagement, as well as the eagerness of advertisers to partner with Netflix,” a Netflix rep said in a statement. The company has not issued guidance on how many subs it expects to take the ad tier, but the company told investors that Netflix Basic With Ads will not represent a “material” contribution to Q4 earnings.Antenna’s estimates are based on data from “a variety of data-collection partners” derived from online purchase receipts; credit, debit and banking data; and “bill-scrape data.”In another indication Netflix’s ad tier may be underperforming, the company fell short on viewership guarantees it made to ad buyers in the first few weeks (in some cases delivering around 80% of targets) and has issued refunds to some clients, trade publication Digiday reported last week, citing anonymous ad-agency execs. Netflix declined to comment on the report.Netflix Basic With Ads launched in the U.S. on Nov. 3 at $6.99 per month (30% less than the the regular Basic plan without ads, at $9.99 per month). The ad-supported package is available in 12 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S.Wall Street analysts generally have continued to be upbeat on the long-term potential for Netflix’s ad plan. Cowen’s John Blackledge, in a Dec. 9 research note, identified Netflix as the firm’s top large-cap stock pick for 2023, citing the ad-supported launch as a key growth driver. “We view NFLX as the best ‘recession play’ in our coverage universe if macro conditions worsen, particularly as the ad tier is attractive for value-conscious consumers,” Blackledge wrote.Alongside the advertising-supported service, Blackledge cited Netflix’s paid sharing solution — aimed at users who share their accounts passwords — as likely to boost revenue per member. Netflix has estimated that passwords are being shared in violation of its rules with more than 100 million non-paying households worldwide. In early 2023, Netflix plans to roll out “a thoughtful approach to monetize account sharing,” the company said in its Q3 shareholder letter, which will let password-sharers create sub-accounts (to add “Extra Members”) if they want to pay for family or friends.There remains strong consumer demand for less expensive, ad-supported streaming plans. According to survey conducted last month by Hub Entertainment Research, 57% of U.S. consumers said they would rather watch ads and pay $4-$5 less per month for a streaming service, a level of interest that has remained relatively stable over the past year.Meanwhile, according to the Hub study, 24% of current Netflix subscribers and 35% of current subs to Disney+ — which bowed its own tier with ads on Dec. 8 — expect to switch to the new ad-supported options. The data is from Hub’s “TV Advertising: Fact vs. Fiction” study, which surveyed 3,001 U.S. consumers aged 14-74 in November 2022 who watch at least one hour of TV per week.“Consumers have demonstrated that, with the right pricing and packaging, they will opt-in to ad-supported video services,” Antenna CEO Jonathan Carson wrote in a blog post on its research. What remains to be seen is whether Netflix’s ad play gains momentum next year — or whether the streamer will modify the package to boost its uptake.Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings, at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit last month, conceded that “I wish we had flipped a few years earlier” on introducing an ad-supported service. But, he added optmistically, “we’ll catch up and in a couple of years we won’t remember when we started it.”VIP+ Analysis: Hurdles Now, Payoff Later for Netflix Ad TierBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in January 2023What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2023Oscar Predictions: Live Action Short - Alfonso Cuarón and Disney are Early Favorites Among Multiple Non-English and International Titles]"

So will next year bring a recovery for Netflix shares? Yahoo Finance media correspondent Allie Canal is here with a preview on all things Netflix next year. Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Soz. Good morning. And I agree. I am pro New Jersey. I'm here right now-- love Jersey. Go Netflix. But yes, Netflix has faced a lot of headwinds this year.But I will say that the stock is up more than 65% over the past six months, and that's largely due to optimism surrounding its ad tier that debuted in November, along with increased competition-- I'm sorry, increased improvements on the content side that could decrease churn as competition intensifies.But some analysts are not that convinced. We have a new note from Laura Martin from Needham, and she highlighted her top concerns for 2023. She said slowing subscriber growth, increased pressure on average revenue per user. That's a key financial metric for Netflix. That will pressure the stock and its revenue targets in 2023.She lowered her full-year 2023 revenue estimates by 7% to $33.4 billion, also lowered expectations for adjusted EBITDA and GAAP EPS. Another concern here, although analysts are predicting that the long-term game is what you need to watch, is advertising. We've seen recent headwinds about Netflix not meeting those viewership targets, a lack of popularity for the ad tier. And the bull case for 2023 really relies on this ad tier being successful. So if they fail, that's going to be reflected in the stock price.And then finally, the fact that we're seeing increased regulatory oversight could also be a headwind. We saw the FTC reject Microsoft's bid to acquire Activision Blizzard. And Martin argued that that hurts Netflix shareholder value in two ways. Number one, she previously said that Netflix could potentially buy Netflix-- that Microsoft could buy Netflix. But the FTC lawsuit makes that possibility unlikely.Story continuesAnd then number two, Microsoft could be distracted by this FTC lawsuit from those ad commitments for Netflix's ad tier in 2023. So all potential issues to look out for as Netflix looks to climb back from those year-to-date declines.- Allie, while we have you, Netflix is also entering into the fitness space. What can you tell us about that?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, very different than what we've seen from Netflix on the content side. But beginning December 30, so just in time for all those new year resolutions, Netflix will be launching 30 hours of workout videos from Nike Training Club. And there are plans to launch more videos throughout 2023.For me, this is another push to nab subscribers, lure them away from competitors. We've seen a lot of these streaming giants play with live events, play with video games. Workouts, why not? Everything just seems to be on the table when it comes to acquiring paying users and increasing profitability. So we'll see. I don't-- Sozzi, I feel like you're going to be doing one of these Netflix workout videos.BRIAN SOZZI: I already did 12 of them. I already-- I already did 12. I'm ready to go. Love them.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Perfect.BRIAN SOZZI: Big fan.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Amazing.BRIAN SOZZI: YeahALEXANDRA CANAL: I love.- Are they actually out yet?BRIAN SOZZI: No. [LAUGHS]ALEXANDRA CANAL: December 30.[LAUGHTER]BRIAN SOZZI: No. I've done them all in my head already.- Allie, thanks so much.]"

The company is now offering US consumers a $7,500 discount on the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. That's double what it was offering earlier this month.This latest discount coming just days after the US Treasury Department delayed restrictions on electric vehicle incentives until March. And that means Tesla and other US made EVs could qualify for the full $7,500 credits temporarily. Now the move is unusual for CEO Elon Musk, who enforced a no discount policy for years, and comes after Tesla warned it will miss its delivery target this year.Hundreds of Tyson employees are choosing to leave the company as it moves to consolidate its offices to Arkansas in the next year. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. Back in October, Tyson announced that it will be shutting down its offices in Chicago and North and South Dakota.Workers at those offices had until November 14 to decide if they would relocate to Arkansas or leave the company. The anticipated employee departures come at a time when beef profits are under pressure. It's worth noting Tyson's beef business reported soaring profit margins over the past two years with strong consumer demand pushing meat prices higher.And Netflix unveiled its plans for one of the largest production facilities in the world, landing in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The company bid a whopping $55 million for the 293 acre location. It was a former military base. This adds to Netflix's existing studios on the East Coast in Brooklyn, which the streamer opened in 2021. Exact titles to be filmed at the new hub still to be determined since the project not expected to be completed until 2027, Sozz.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, Julie, who said Jersey wasn't cool? Not this guy. Not this guy, and clearly not Netflix.]"

The tightened monetary policy, looming fears of recession, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising commodity prices and supply-chain headwinds have compelled investors to look for safe and profitable investment options with growth potential.Why Growth Stocks?Growth stocks are a lucrative way to channelize the investments, as these stocks with above-average financial growth can easily capture the market's attention and generate higher returns. Investing in such stocks can fetch solid returns over the long and short run. Growth stocks include companies having the potential to exceed the overall market growth over time with higher profits and revenues.With the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it much easier to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Why Invest in Dividend-Paying Stocks?Investors generally look for safe and profitable stocks apart from focusing on growth investments. This is easily catered by stocks that pay regular quarterly dividend as these have a stable profit stream with a strong balance sheet. Investing in dividend stocks is also appealing for investors seeking a regular income stream or making wealth by reinvesting dividend payments into capital accumulation.

Also, this leading independent oil and gas exploration and production company’s shares have surged 24% year to date.What’s Favoring the Stock?West Texas Intermediate crude price, trading at more than $75 per barrel, is highly favorable for oil explorers and producers. Pioneer Natural is well placed to capitalize on the handsome pricing scenario. PXD, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a strong presence in the low-cost oil-rich Midland basin — a sub-basin of the broader Permian. The upstream energy player has a huge inventory of premium wells that will likely generate significant returns for the company.Pioneer Natural is focused on returning capital to shareholders. This includes a substantial variable dividend along with a strong base dividend. It is also employing opportunistic share repurchases to reward shareholders.Pioneer Natural has considerably lower exposure to debt capital than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. This reflects PXD’s strong balance sheet on which the firm can rely to sail through the volatile energy businesses.RisksDespite all those positive factors, like all upstream players, PXD’s overall operations are significantly exposed to volatility in oil and natural gas prices.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the energy space are Phillips 66 PSX, Precision Drilling Corporation PDS and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. NEX. All the stocks carry a Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To make its operations more stable, Phillips 66 is giving more attention to midstream (pipelines), renewables and chemicals businesses.

Its services also include offering well service rigs. With high commodity prices, demand for PDS’ drilling rigs is favorable.Story continuesNexTier Oilfield Solutionsis also a well-known U.S. land oilfield service player.

(NYSE:TJX)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-tell-story-tjx-companies-110042171.html,1671793242,STORY,['TJX'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 26.7x The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.TJX Companies certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies peKeen to find out how analysts think TJX Companies' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like TJX Companies' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 31%. EPS has also lifted 14% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 14% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why TJX Companies is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From TJX Companies' P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of TJX Companies' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Plus, you should also learn about these 2 warning signs we've spotted with TJX Companies (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us).You might be able to find a better investment than TJX Companies.

106,11a7b07e-cfca-30bd-95ee-098febcb228f,NEM,2022-12-23,3 Stocks That Will Surge in 2023 as Fed Rate Hikes Continue,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-surge-2023-fed-130537426.html,1671541537,STORY,"['RIO', 'JPM', 'NEM']","[With the new year just around the corner, it’s a good time to look at attractive stocks to buy. There need to be some portfolio adjustments based on potential monetary policy action.An era of artificially low-interest rates is over. The Federal Reserve has pursued aggressive contractionary monetary policies since March. There is a big possibility that tight money policies will sustain in 2023, and inflation will remain relatively stubborn.It goes without saying that the tight money policy has impacted equities. Growth stocks have witnessed a significant correction. At the same time, there are investment themes that are expected to perform well amidst the rate hike.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsComing back to expectations of the rate hikes, Patrick Leary, a senior trader with Loop Capital Markets, believes the Fed is eyeing a terminal rate of about 5.25%. There is also a consensus that the Fed will keep rates high through 2023.With this overview, let’s talk about three stocks to buy that will surge in 2023 as the Fed rate hike continues.TickerCompanyPriceNEMNewmont Corporation$45.60JPMJPMorgan Chase$130.06RIORio Tinto$68.86Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockThere are two important reasons to be bullish on gold for 2023. First and foremost, expectations of a rate hike imply that inflation will be relatively stubborn. Gold might continue to trend higher after bottoming out at around $1,600 an ounce in 2022. Furthermore, several economists believe that there is a possibility of a recession in 2023. Investors will seek refuge in hard assets like gold and bonds.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is among the top stocks to buy. A big reason to like Newmont is the company’s investment-grade balance sheet. A strong cash buffer and healthy cash flows will ensure that dividends sustain. NEM stock also trades at attractive valuations after a correction of almost 25% for year-to-date 2022.Story continuesNewmont is also attractive from an asset perspective. The company has 96 million ounces of proven reserves. There is clear cash flow visibility with expectations of stable production through the 2040s. Newmont also expects the all-in-sustaining cost to decline in the coming years. This will boost the EBITDA margin and translate into cash flow upside.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comBanking stocks have been subdued through 2022. However, net interest income margin expansion will continue with the rate hikes. This is a positive catalyst for banks. It’s, therefore, not surprising that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock has trended higher by 14% in the last six months. With the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.2, there is potential for further rally. JPM stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.0%.It’s worth noting that JPMorgan posted a record net interest income for Q3 2022. The bank has also reaffirmed its guidance for the full year. The bank’s CEO also pointed out that consumers and businesses have remained healthy.Between 2004 and 2007, the Fed increased interest rates. During the same period, credit growth accelerated. Therefore, a rate hike does not necessarily imply that credit growth will be muted. I, therefore, remain bullish on the bank’s core business growth in 2023. This is likely to offset some depression in the investment banking business if equity market conditions remain challenging through the next year.Rio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comWith inflation likely to remain high, industrial commodity stocks will also likely be performers. It’s also worth noting that with recession fears, China might pursue a stimulus package to boost economic activity. This will be positive for iron ore, among other industrial commodities.Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a quality stock pick for 2023. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.9, the stock is undervalued. RIO stock also offers investors an attractive dividend yield of 9.85%.From a financial perspective, Rio Tinto reported a free cash flow of $7.1 billion for the first half of 2022. Cash flows have remained robust even with some decline in commodity prices. With a strong balance sheet, dividends are likely to sustain.At the same time, Rio Tinto plans to invest $9 to $10 billion annually in the next two years. These investments will translate into revenue and cash flow upside.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This brings the mining giant a step closer to closing in on its biggest acquisition in the decade. This takeover would significantly enhance its exposure to future-facing commodities while adding attractive synergies.The execution of the Scheme Implementation Deed follows the completion of a four-week exclusive due diligence period. OZ Mineral’s Board has unanimously recommended that the company’s shareholders vote in favor of the acquisition. A meeting of OZ Mineral’s shareholders is expected to be held in late March or early April 2023.BHP made its first offer to acquire OZ Minerals Limited for AUD25 per share on Aug 7, 2022. Its Board had rejected the offer citing that it undervalues the company and was not in the best interests of shareholders. On Nov 18, BHP raised its offer price to A$28.25 per share which represented a 49.3% premium to OZ Minerals’ closing price on Aug 5, 2022 — the last trading day prior to BHP’s initial proposal.OZ Minerals has a high-quality portfolio of copper and nickel assets, located in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction with long mine lives and first-quartile cost positioning.  It owns and operates Prominent Hill, a high-quality copper-gold mine, and Carrapateena, an iron-oxide-copper–gold underground mine, both located in the highly prospective Gawler Craton in South Australia.The Carajás East Hub located in Brazil is also part of its portfolio. This hub comprises the Pedra Branca underground mine, which is the beginning of a potential series of small, high-quality copper-gold mines with ore being processed at existing facilities at the nearby, now-depleted Antas mine.This deal, which values OZ Minerals at AUD9.6 billion ($6.4 billion), would further BHP’s efforts to boost its supplies of copper and nickel, and enable  its strategy to capitalize on the surging demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy. The combination will also help BHP unlock potential operational synergies in South Australia as OZ Minerals’ Carrapateena and Prominent Hill mines are in proximity to the Olympic Dam and Oak Dam development resources. OZ Mineral’s West Musgrave project will add a large greenfield nickel option to BHP’s Nickel West premier nickel sulfide resource position in Western Australia.Story continuesPrice PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBHP Group’s shares have gained 4.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s 3.9% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderBHP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

113,565d8a3b-8b1d-3b3c-a445-0fa00ec234f3,M,2022-12-23,"Is Trending Stock Macy's, Inc. (M) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-macys-inc-m-140002508.html,1671717602,STORY,['M'],"[Macy's (M) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this department store operator have returned -12.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.7% change. The Zacks Retail - Regional Department Stores industry, to which Macy's belongs, has lost 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Macy's is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.20 points to a change of -20.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 indicates a change of -6% from what Macy's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Macy's.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for M _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Macy's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $24.49 billion and $24.58 billion estimates indicate +0.1% and +0.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMacy's reported revenues of $5.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.06%. The EPS surprise was +173.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Macy's is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Macy's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.General Dynamics could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on General Dynamics.Is There Enough Growth For General Dynamics?In order to justify its P/E ratio, General Dynamics would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.5% gain to the company's bottom line. Still, EPS has barely risen at all in aggregate from three years ago, which is not ideal. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.3% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that General Dynamics' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that General Dynamics currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.And what about other risks?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Recent times haven't been advantageous for Zoetis as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies.

The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 45% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 10% per year during the coming three years according to the eleven analysts following the company.

121,3c8782ee-8624-3fae-a8a9-d36638addae6,MAS,2022-12-23,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-masco-corporation-183347035.html,1671734027,STORY,['MAS'],"[Does the December share price for Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Masco What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$873.4mUS$874.1mUS$869.0mUS$954.0mUS$977.4mUS$999.9mUS$1.02bUS$1.04bUS$1.07bUS$1.09bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.21%Est @ 2.14%Est @ 2.09%Est @ 2.06% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$803US$738US$674US$680US$640US$602US$565US$531US$498US$467(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.2bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.0%) = US$16bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$16b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$7.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$47.1, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Masco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.229. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MascoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Building market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Masco, we've compiled three important elements you should look at:Risks: For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Masco (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does MAS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

HuffstutterCHICAGO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc said it suspended and reduced operations at some U.S. meat facilities on Thursday due to a massive winter storm, while farmers increased checks on livestock facing harsh winds and cold.The extreme weather presented a temporary challenge to food production after consumers grappled this year with soaring inflation, supply-chain shortages and drought that seared farmland in the western United States.Tyson, which sells beef, pork and chicken and is the largest U.S. meat producer by sales, said it scaled back operations to protect employees and animals.""We are in close contact with our customers to minimize disruption and continue to fulfill customer orders,"" the company said.In Kansas, the third-largest U.S. cattle state behind Texas and Nebraska, the National Weather Service warned of ""dangerously cold"" wind chills reaching -40 Fahrenheit (-40 Celsius), though temperatures were expected to rise on Friday.Ranchers were constantly checking their cattle to make sure they were not in distress and had access to water that was not frozen, said Kansas Farm Bureau spokesman Greg Doering.""They will make it through,"" Doering said about cattle. ""This is an extreme event but it's going to be short lived.""In Douglas, North Dakota, farmer Daryl Lies said his family used farm machinery and snow blowers to clear paths between four-foot-tall snow drifts so their cattle could reach water, hay and shelter. They kept a close eye on hog barns to make sure animals inside remained warm.""It's 20 below without the windchill right now, and we’re better off than some,"" said Lies, president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. ""These winds will suck a lot of heat out fast.""Some Archer-Daniels-Midland grain facilities in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana closed early, the company said.Farmers showed little interest in making new deals to sell corn and soybeans, and were not delivering crops due to the bad weather, grain dealers said.Wheat farmers in the central Plains worried that frigid temperatures may kill or damage dormant crops that lack a protective layer of snow.

HuffstutterCHICAGO (Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc said it suspended and reduced operations at some U.S. meat facilities on Thursday due to a massive winter storm, while farmers increased checks on livestock facing harsh winds and cold.The extreme weather presented a temporary challenge to food production after consumers grappled this year with soaring inflation, supply-chain shortages and drought that seared farmland in the western United States.Tyson, which sells beef, pork and chicken and is the largest U.S. meat producer by sales, said it scaled back operations to protect employees and animals.""We are in close contact with our customers to minimize disruption and continue to fulfill customer orders,"" the company said.In Kansas, the third-largest U.S. cattle state behind Texas and Nebraska, the National Weather Service warned of ""dangerously cold"" wind chills reaching -40 Fahrenheit (-40 Celsius), though temperatures were expected to rise on Friday.Ranchers were constantly checking their cattle to make sure they were not in distress and had access to water that was not frozen, said Kansas Farm Bureau spokesman Greg Doering.""They will make it through,"" Doering said about cattle. ""This is an extreme event but it's going to be short lived.""In Douglas, North Dakota, farmer Daryl Lies said his family used farm machinery and snow blowers to clear paths between four-foot-tall snow drifts so their cattle could reach water, hay and shelter. They kept a close eye on hog barns to make sure animals inside remained warm.""It's 20 below without the windchill right now, and we’re better off than some,"" said Lies, president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. ""These winds will suck a lot of heat out fast.""Some Archer-Daniels-Midland grain facilities in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana closed early, the company said.Farmers showed little interest in making new deals to sell corn and soybeans, and were not delivering crops due to the bad weather, grain dealers said.Wheat farmers in the central Plains worried that frigid temperatures may kill or damage dormant crops that lack a protective layer of snow.(Reporting by Tom Polansek and PJ Huffstutter in Chicago; Additional reporting by Mark Weinraub in Chicago; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Aurora Ellis)]"

For more brands, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Brands That Are Great Investments Now.Cover even a basic course in finance and you are likely to come across several different ways to value a company. These range from simple ratios to complex methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis which involves projecting a firm's cash flows into the future and then discounting them back to gain a sense of its fair value. Another popular, and easy, method is market capitalization, which simply multiplies the firm's outstanding shares with its share price.However, capturing the non-intrinsic value of a company - one that is determined by customer goodwill, corporate practices, and brand strength - is more difficult simply due to the qualitative nature of these factors. Calculating this value becomes crucial at the time of mergers or acquisitions, as the acquiring firm often ends up paying a premium for the target if the latter is a strong brand. This premium is called synergy during the acquisition phase, and its value is reflected as goodwill on the balance sheet of the acquiring entity. The balance sheet adjustment has to be made because the price paid for a firm is often higher than the value of its assets, and an adjustment is necessary to balance the 'balance' sheet.Today's piece will look at some of the most valuable brands in the world, and determine if they are also popular with hedge funds.

This brings the mining giant a step closer to closing in on its biggest acquisition in the decade. This takeover would significantly enhance its exposure to future-facing commodities while adding attractive synergies.The execution of the Scheme Implementation Deed follows the completion of a four-week exclusive due diligence period. OZ Mineral’s Board has unanimously recommended that the company’s shareholders vote in favor of the acquisition. A meeting of OZ Mineral’s shareholders is expected to be held in late March or early April 2023.BHP made its first offer to acquire OZ Minerals Limited for AUD25 per share on Aug 7, 2022. Its Board had rejected the offer citing that it undervalues the company and was not in the best interests of shareholders. On Nov 18, BHP raised its offer price to A$28.25 per share which represented a 49.3% premium to OZ Minerals’ closing price on Aug 5, 2022 — the last trading day prior to BHP’s initial proposal.OZ Minerals has a high-quality portfolio of copper and nickel assets, located in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction with long mine lives and first-quartile cost positioning.  It owns and operates Prominent Hill, a high-quality copper-gold mine, and Carrapateena, an iron-oxide-copper–gold underground mine, both located in the highly prospective Gawler Craton in South Australia.The Carajás East Hub located in Brazil is also part of its portfolio. This hub comprises the Pedra Branca underground mine, which is the beginning of a potential series of small, high-quality copper-gold mines with ore being processed at existing facilities at the nearby, now-depleted Antas mine.This deal, which values OZ Minerals at AUD9.6 billion ($6.4 billion), would further BHP’s efforts to boost its supplies of copper and nickel, and enable  its strategy to capitalize on the surging demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy. The combination will also help BHP unlock potential operational synergies in South Australia as OZ Minerals’ Carrapateena and Prominent Hill mines are in proximity to the Olympic Dam and Oak Dam development resources. OZ Mineral’s West Musgrave project will add a large greenfield nickel option to BHP’s Nickel West premier nickel sulfide resource position in Western Australia.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBHP Group’s shares have gained 4.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s 3.9% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderBHP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

135,087013c8-9c4b-3a21-8486-a2ea48b9c5c1,QCOM,2022-12-23,What Is QUALCOMM Incorporated's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Share Price Doing?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporateds-nasdaq-qcom-share-130045593.html,1671800445,STORY,['QCOM'],"[QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$128 and falling to the lows of US$104. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether QUALCOMM's current trading price of US$111 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Is QUALCOMM Still Cheap?Great news for investors – QUALCOMM is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $152.92, but it is currently trading at US$111 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that QUALCOMM’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from QUALCOMM?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -15% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for QUALCOMM. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although QCOM is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to QCOM, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing QUALCOMM at this point in time. When we did our research, we found 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 is significant!) that we believe deserve your full attention.If you are no longer interested in QUALCOMM, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

136,6fdabf4d-38c1-3fa0-a349-d383ba99cacc,QCOM,2022-12-23,20 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-companies-sponsor-h1b-122007815.html,1671798007,STORY,"['V', 'NVDA', 'IBM', 'UBER', 'QCOM', 'INTC', 'AMZN', 'INFY', 'WMT', 'AAPL', 'ORCL', 'CSCO', 'CTSH', 'CRM', 'JPM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 biggest companies that sponsor H1B visas. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) which includes new applications, new approvals, rolling approvals, and rolling denials.

138,f149aaa9-cb05-3667-8c1f-dc70cebc5da4,LMT,2022-12-23,Possible bearish signals as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) insiders disposed of US$13m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-lockheed-martin-120051379.html,1671796851,STORY,['LMT'],"[In the last year, many Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$479. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Lockheed Martin shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Lockheed Martin better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Lockheed Martin Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Lockheed Martin. We can see that insider John Donovan paid US$251k for shares in the company. No-one sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Story continuesDoes Lockheed Martin Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.07% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$86m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?The recent insider purchase is heartening. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The more recent transactions are a positive, but Lockheed Martin insiders haven't shown the sustained enthusiasm that we look for, although they do own a decent number of shares, overall. Overall they seem reasonably aligned. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Lockheed Martin.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Shares have lost about 2.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Medtronic due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Medtronic Q2 Earnings Top Estimates, Margins ContractMedtronic reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 in second-quarter fiscal 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%. However, adjusted earnings declined 1.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Currency-adjusted EPS came in at $1.31 in the quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization and restructuring expenses, acquisition-related costs and certain medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP earnings per share was 32 cents, down 67% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.59 billion, up 2% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency) and down 3% on a reported basis. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%.The Q2 organic revenues, according to the company, reflect slower supply recovery and lower-than-anticipated underlying market procedure volumes in certain businesses and the pricing impact of volume-based procurement in China. These were partially offset by strength in certain product lines, including Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVR), Cardiac Pacing, Core Spine in the United States and Diabetes in International.Q2 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (54% of total revenues) were up 2% on a reported basis (up 1% on an organic basis) to $4.07 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.16 billion (28% of total revenues), down 13% on a reported basis (up 3% on an organic basis).Story continuesEmerging market revenues (18% of total revenues) amounted to $1.36 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 4% organically).Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.In the fiscal second quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 4.4% at CER to $2.77 billion, with all three divisions returning to organic growth this quarter, including a high-single-digit increase in Structural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA) and low-single-digit increases in Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF) and Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV).CRHF sales totaled $1.43 billion, up 3.5% year over year at CER. Revenues from SHA were up 8.1% at CER to $757 million. CPV revenues were up 1.7% at CER to $584 million.For the Cardiovascular segment, we projected $2.92 billion in revenues for the fiscal second quarter.In Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2.07 billion, down 3.5% year over year at CER. A low-double-digit decline in Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal (RGR) was partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Surgical Innovations (SI). Excluding the impact of COVID-led strong ventilator sales in the prior year, Medical Surgical revenues dropped 1% at CER.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.19 billion were up 5% year over year at CER, driven by a high-single-digit increase in Specialty Therapies, a mid-single-digit increase in Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies (CST) and Neuromodulation revenues remaining unchanged on a year-over-year basis, all organically.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 3% at CER to $556 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenue declined in low-double digits in Q2, offset by mid-teens growth organic growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-double-digit growth organic growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by high-teens growth of insulin pumps, low-twenties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products and high-single-digit growth in consumable sales.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 66.6% on a 5.6% fall in gross profit to $5.05 billion.Research and development expenses were unchanged year over year at $676 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses inched up 0.1% to $2.62 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 308 bps year over year to 23.2%.GuidanceMedtronic issued a fiscal 2023 second-half revenue-growth guidance.Second-half revenue growth is expected in the range of 3.5-4% on an organic basis, accelerating over the first half. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of November, revenue growth in the fiscal year 2023 would be affected by $1.74-$1.84 billion compared with the previous range of $1.4-$1.5 billion impact.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 worldwide revenues is pegged at $31.52 billion.The company updated its fiscal 2023 financial guidance for earnings per share.Full-year adjusted earnings per share projection has been updated in the range of $5.25 to $5.30 (a reduction from earlier $5.53 to $5.65), including an estimated 18 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.52.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.35% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Medtronic has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Medtronic has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMedtronic belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Another stock from the same industry, NuVasive (NUVA), has gained 6.1% over the past month.

Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”9. Walmart Inc.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8.

As a result, doctors are already considering limiting molnupiravir's use, for instance, in Australia.The latest results offer more detail and have been peer-reviewed.The study, called PANORAMIC, compared the oral pill against standard treatment alone in people over 50 or those aged 18 and older with underlying conditions. They had been unwell with confirmed COVID for five days or fewer in the community setting.When Merck originally tested molnupiravir, it was found 30% effective in reducing hospitalisations, but that was in unvaccinated patients.In the latest study, led by University of Oxford researchers, nearly all of the more than 25,000 patients in the study had received at least three vaccine doses.These results demonstrate that vaccine protection is so strong that there is no obvious benefit from the drug in terms of further reducing hospitalisation and deaths, said study co-author Jonathan Van-Tam from the University of Nottingham.The drug was, however, effective in reducing viral load and can help hasten patient recovery by roughly four days, researchers estimated based on study data.There might be circumstances in which molnupiravir could be useful, for instance, in under-pressure health systems where it could be used to help key workers back to work quicker, said co-chief study investigator Chris Butler from the University of Oxford.But ultimately, those benefits need to be weighed against the drug's cost, added co-chief study investigator Paul Little from the University of Southampton. The drug, which was developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is estimated to cost several hundred pounds for a five-day course.Story continues""For the moment, I think you have to say that don't use this drug in the general population, including those at slightly higher-risk,"" said Little.Extremely clinically vulnerable patients, although eligible to enroll in PANORAMIC, were encouraged to access COVID treatment directly from Britain's National Health Service, so the molnupiravir findings are less applicable to highest-risk patients, authors wrote in the medical journal Lancet.Last month, Britain's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended against the use of molnupiravir at current prices because the cost-effectiveness estimates are higher than what it considered an acceptable use of the national health system's resources.

The Fed has indicated further rate hikes in 2023, causing investor concerns and markets to suffer.Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have yielded negative returns of 8.15%, 18.63% and 31.55%, respectively. The biggest challenge for the U.S. economy is presently multi-year high inflation. Although inflation has lately shown signs of cooling off, the crisis is far from over.Fed to Continue Hiking RatesThe consumer pricing index (CPI) data for November showed a 7.1% year-over-year increase in inflation, indicating a slowdown from the record highs of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. However, it is still at multi-year highs and the Fed has indicated more rate hikes in 2023.The Fed hiked interest rates by 50 basis points in its December meeting, after going for four consecutive hikes of 75 basis points earlier. The current cumulative interest rate, which is in the 4.25-4.5% range, is the highest since 1980.Markets participants were initially optimistic that the Fed would go slow on its aggressive rate-hike stance, given that inflation showed signs of cooling in November.The Fed also echoed similar sentiments and slowed down its pace. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell continued with his hawkish monetary policy and cautioned that the fight against inflation is not yet over and that significant questions, including how much and how long interest rates would need to be raised, remain unresolved.Market participants are concerned that the high borrowing costs, which are still far from the Fed's aim of 2%, could hurt the economy and push it into a recession.Moreover, geopolitical tensions also have left markets unsettled. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which caused a global oil and gas shortage, is having indirectly affecting the supply chain.Story continuesAlso, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths in China have compelled Beijing to implement restrictions once again, reducing business and consumer activity. These have have affected global business and markets.Given this situation, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks. This is because dividend stocks have the potential to endure market volatility and a track record of success and a solid business plan.Dividend stocks not only offer a consistent flow of revenues but also minimize the likelihood of frequent price changes. Additionally, during times of market turbulence, dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. Four such companies are Sandstorm Gold Ltd.

(NYSE:ROK) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Rockwell Automation’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Is Rockwell Automation Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Rockwell Automation seems to be fairly priced at around 6.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Rockwell Automation today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $276.82, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Rockwell Automation’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Rockwell Automation generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 52% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Rockwell Automation. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ROK’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ROK, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Rockwell Automation at this point in time.

The 777X had previously been expected to be released for use in June 2020.Congress approved a sweeping certification reform bill in late 2020 after two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that had added new requirements to getting aircraft approved.Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said in April that it is ""definitely a more rigorous process that we're all going through"" to get airplanes certified.

If you want to see more best upside stocks to buy right now, go directly to 5 Best Upside Stocks to Buy Right Now.Stocks with upside are stocks that have the potential to increase in the future.While every investors' definition of the future is different, long term investors generally view the future as 10 years.Given the decline in the market this year, there are arguably more stocks with upside than before.Because inflation has increased substantially, demand for many companies have weakened as some consumers have looked for lower priced alternatives.Given the higher inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year which has increased borrowing costs and lowered equity valuations as capital has moved from the equity market into the U.S. government bond market.With the Federal Reserve potentially increasing interest rates further next year, many economists think there could be a recession in 2023.As a result of the high inflation, substantial interest rate increases, and the probability of a recession next year, the broader market has declined substantially and a lot of stocks are lower.In the long term, however, it is likely that the Federal Reserve will win its fight against inflation and inflation will normalize. If inflation and interest rates normalize, the U.S. economy could grow faster and there's potential for valuations to increase.If market valuations increase substantially enough, many stocks could rise and hence realize some of their upside.The Best Upside StocksThe best upside stocks are stocks that not only could rally substantially but also have quality businesses with competitive advantages. Generally they would be blue chips that have fallen out of favor for various temporary reasons that might improve sometime in the next ten years.Because they have great businesses, the blue chips are more likely to realize their upside in the long term versus companies that don't have as great of a business.Story continuesBecause they have great businesses, the best upside stocks also arguably have less downside as many have high quality earnings potential.DownsideJust as every stock has an upside, every stock also has a downside. Stocks could decline further if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected or if economic data fails to meet expectations. Stocks could also decline for various company specific or sector specific reasons.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Upside Stocks to Buy Right Now, we picked 10 stocks that have quality businesses that could rally in the next 10 years.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.10 Best Upside Stocks to Buy Right Now10. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has upside if the civilian aerospace market recovers. Shares of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) fell substantially in 2020 given the pandemic which decreased demand for civilian air travel and the company's earnings per share have not done well ever since despite The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also owning a leading aerospace defense business. While the company lost $2.05 per share in 2021, analysts expect the company to lose $7.93 per share in 2022 given the headwinds.Nevertheless, analysts do think there could be a recovery in the future as they expect The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) to make a profit of $3.70 per share in 2023 and earn $7.04 per share in 2024. Much of the expected profit recovery depends on the rebound on civilian air travel which is far from certain given the uncertainty with the pandemic. As a result, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is arguably a high reward high risk blue chip on our list.Alongside The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a stock with upside that's held by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q3.9. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) shares have declined over 22% year to date given the broader market decline which decreases the company's profitability. In Q3, the company's sales decreased 15% year over year and its adjusted EPS decreased 16% year over year given the headwinds.While the short term is bearish, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) benefits from being a leader in passive ETFs, which is a multi-trillion dollar asset class that's expected to continue to grow in the long term. If BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) maintains its market share and grows its AUM, the company could continue to grow its earnings in the long term.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 46 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q3.8. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leader in producing cutting edge semiconductor producing equipment that's pretty essential for the industry.Considering the semiconductor industry has slowed this year and the tensions between China and the United States have increased, analysts expect the company's EPS to decrease to $14.34 in 2022 from $15.63 per share in 2021. With the headwinds, the company's stock has declined 27% year to date.Nevertheless the semiconductor industry will grow in the long term and analysts expect ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s EPS to rise. In terms of the consensus, analysts expect the company to earn $19.22 per share for 2023 and $23.87 per share for 2024.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Due to high inflation, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a stock that has a great brand that hasn't done well this year given the lower than expected demand and higher inventories. If there is a recession next year, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s EPS might not do very well in 2023 given its apparel and shoes cost more than many competitors.Nevertheless, the global economy will recover in the long run and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s EPS could increase substantially in the next ten years if it maintains its market share in the premium apparel and shoe industry.6. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the big four U.S. banks with substantial scale and earnings power. Given the potential for a recession next year in addition to other factors, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock has decreased 25.8% year to date. Furthermore, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) has underperformed some of its other big four bank peers given it doesn't benefit as much from the rising net interest income given its consumer business isn't as big.At the end of the third quarter, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) had a book value per share of $92.71 and a tangible book value per share of $80.34, which is substantially higher than the bank's current price of $44.81 per share. Although many banks trade at a considerable discount to their book values, the metric nevertheless indicates that Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) has long term upside if it can improve the quality of its earnings and maintain its market share.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 85 owned shares of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #6 on our list of 10 Best Upside Stocks to Buy Right Now.Like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc.

The 777X had previously been expected to be released for use in June 2020.Congress approved a sweeping certification reform bill in late 2020 after two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that had added new requirements to getting aircraft approved.Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said in April that it is ""definitely a more rigorous process that we're all going through"" to get airplanes certified.(Reporting by David ShepardsonEditing by Chris Reese and Deepa Babington)]"

MAA and Sun Communities, Inc. SUI.Industry: Residential REITLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2030860/3-residential-reits-to-consider-despite-industry-challengesThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential Industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of soft rental housing demand amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation despite job gains and wage growth. Elevated deliveries and regulatory issues are also expected to add to the woes. Moreover, a hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Nevertheless, residential REITs like Equity Residential, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and Sun Communities, Inc. are poised to benefit as mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option. Also, residential REITs are banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of their operating platform.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs also focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region.Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, the enrollment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Weak New-Lease Apartment Demand: The inflationary environment and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely to have an adverse impact on this industry's performance. In fact, despite growth in jobs and wages, new-lease apartment demand remains weak amid low consumer confidence and weak household formation. In addition, there is a seasonality impact during winter months. With leasing traffic remaining soft, apartment rents are likely to bear the brunt .Elevated Deliveries of New Units: Although supply-chain woes and labor challenges have impacted construction activity to some extent in recent quarters, deliveries of new units are likely to accelerate in a number of markets in the upcoming quarters as the ongoing construction activity remains high, resulting in a struggle on the part of landlords to lure renters.Per a RealPage report, the U.S. apartment market is on course to add almost 3,300 communities, comprising around 590,000 units in 2023. This marks the largest delivery volume since RealPage started tracking the U.S. apartment market 30 years ago. Although construction costs are up, landlords have been able to pass on the burden to renters, who are supported by wage growth to absorb cost increases through rent hikes.Rent Control and Higher Interest Rates: The rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In fact, in recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs' power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees.Moreover, the hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes. However, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option.Rebound in Demand for Student Housing Properties: There has been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. Per a RealPage report, for fall 2023, already more than a quarter of student beds are pre-leased.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend, and now residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, as well as enhancing customer experience. The REITs are now focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in process and process enhancements. Improvement in search and tour booking as well as smart home access has gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on these.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's growth potential. Since August 2022, the industry's FFO per share estimate for 2022 has moved marginally down. Moreover, over the past year, the industry's FFO per share estimate for 2023 has moved 1.0% south.However, before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 33.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 19.4% and the broader Finance sector's decline of 14.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.16X compared with the S&amp;P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 16.99X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector's forward 12-month P/E of 13.02X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.48X, as low as 15.16X, with a median of 18.96X.3 Residential REIT Stocks Trying to Survive Industry ChallengesEquity Residential: Based in Chicago, IL, this residential REIT is one of the leading, publicly-traded multi-family REITs in the United States.It is well-positioned to benefit from its portfolio rebalancing efforts and a strong balance sheet. Equity Residential's efforts to diversify its portfolio in the urban and suburban markets, with an affluent tenant base, bode well.Its strategic buyouts and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform act as tailwinds.Currently, EQR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2022 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates revised marginally upward over the past two months to $3.53. The company's shares have declined 12.3% so far in the quarter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mid-America Apartment Communities: Headquartered in Germantown, TN, and commonly known as MAA, this residential REIT is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Mid-America Apartment's well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. The favorable in-migration trends of jobs and households in SunBelt submarkets are likely to fuel demand.We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues going forward. The prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to expand margins. Its solid balance sheet acts as a tailwind.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The recent trend in estimate revision indicates a favorable outlook for MAA. Particularly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share has been revised 1.4% upward over the past month to $8.46.Also, the consensus mark for 2023 FFO per share has moved 0.3% north over the past month to $9.17. The company's shares have declined 0.6% so far in the quarter.Sun Communities, Inc.: The Southfield, MI-based residential REIT enjoys a stake in or is engaged in the ownership or operation of manufactured housing communities, recreational vehicle (RV) resorts and marina properties across 39 states, Canada, Puerto Rico and the UK.This REIT is poised to benefit from its growth efforts in manufactured housing, RV resorts and marinas. The continued demand for affordable housing is acting as a tailwind, while demand for RV vacations is picking up pace amid the resumption of normalcy. Sun Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share has been revised 1.1% upward in the past month. The company's shares have increased 2.6% so far in the quarter.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Cigna hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn around. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. View our latest analysis for Cigna peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Cigna.How Is Cigna's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like Cigna's is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 14%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 76% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 4.0% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.3% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.In light of this, it's curious that Cigna's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Cigna's P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.We've established that Cigna currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Cigna that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Cigna. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

165,37050b57-4917-3da6-b83d-102c0e88bae8,CI,2022-12-23,"4 HMO Stocks in Focus Despite Tech Costs, Nursing Shortage",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-hmo-stocks-focus-despite-141302039.html,1671718382,STORY,"['UNH', 'CI', 'CNC', 'HUM', '^GSPC']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to be aided by continued growth in premiums, a solid customer base and consistent contract wins. Despite its solid prospects, the industry has been grappling with escalating costs resulting from continued investments to bolster digital capabilities. Shortage of nurses and inflationary pressure continue to hamper the efficacies of HMO industry players. In spite of the prevailing challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, Cigna Corporation CI, Humana Inc. HUM and Centene Corporation CNC are better placed to navigate the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of its subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO IndustryTechnology Investments Amid a Growing Digital Era: Players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay abreast with the ongoing digital trend. These investments are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms through which the operational efficiencies of healthcare providers receive a boost. Telehealth platforms have exhibited solid demand since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as these offered healthcare services within the comfort of one’s home. There are no signs of the demand receding and therefore it seems prudent on the part of HMO players to undertake digital investments. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Story continuesNursing Shortage: A notable headwind that has been troubling the U.S. healthcare industry for quite some is an acute shortage of nurses. Health insurers collaborate with several hospitals, as a result of which health plan members of the former can avail hospital treatments at discounted rates. Thereby, health insurers have to depend on nurses and other medical personnel for providing quality managed care services at hospitals per the unique needs of their clients. In the absence of a sufficient nursing workforce, a hospital’s ability to deliver quality services might get affected, which, in turn, may indirectly impact the customer base of a health insurer. A McKinsey report, forecasting that the United States might witness a shortage of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025, further highlights the dismal scenario that awaits health insurers.Well-Performing Government Business: The health insurers devise affordable Medicare, Medicaid and Marketplace plans as part of the government business. Frequently, health plans are upgraded with attractive features to retain existing customers as well as attract new ones. Additionally, the HMO players remain on a spree to come up with advanced health plans as that might win them federal or state contracts from time to time. This, in turn, bolsters the customer base and leads to a steady rise in premiums. Increasing premiums bode well for the top line. However, amid the continued inflationary headwind that often takes a toll on the spending habits of consumers, the ability of consumers to continue paying for health plan premiums remain uncertain to some extent.An Aging U.S. Population: While an aging U.S. population might have been one of the factors contributing to the nationwide nursing scarcity issue, it has definitely been a blessing in disguise for health insurers offering Medicare plans. Meant to benefit people aged 65 or above, Medicare plans are expected to remain in solid demand on account of a growing aging population across the United States. According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, around 16.9% of the American population was aged 65 years or above in 2020 and the percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. In an effort to bolster the Medicare customer base, the industry participants even operate senior-focused centers for delivering quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical  sector.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) Trading At A 45% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skyworks-solutions-inc-nasdaq-swks-144351761.html,1671720231,STORY,['SWKS'],"[How far off is Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.96bUS$1.90bUS$1.97bUS$1.95bUS$2.08bUS$2.13bUS$2.18bUS$2.23bUS$2.28bUS$2.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25%Est @ 2.17%Est @ 2.11% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$960(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.0%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$27b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$91.9, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Skyworks Solutions as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.308. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Skyworks SolutionsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

(NYSE:NKE) reported earnings results, the stock plummeted 13% in a single trading session. Despite weakness in the companys report, I wrote that I still believed the stock was being underestimated by the market.Fast forward to a few days ago and Nikes stock surged more than 12% as the company reported better than expected results for its latest quarter. Following this price movement, Nike is now trading above its long-term valuation multiples, but I think the stock is still trading at a discount; here's why.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKEQuarterly highlightsNike reported earnings results for the secon -quarter of its fiscal year 2023 on Dec. 20. Revenue grew 17.3% to $13.3 billion, topping expectations by $740 million. Earnings per share of 85 cents was slightly higher than the 83 cents the company had in the prior year and 21 cents above estimates. Net income of $1.3 billion was essentially unchanged from the prior year.Revenue for Nike Direct grew 16% on a reported basis (25% on a currency neutral basis) to $5.4 billion, driven by a 25% increase (34% on a currency neutral basis) for Nike Brand Digital. As we can see, currency exchange was a huge headwind.Wholesale revenues were up 19% (30% on a currency neutral basis). Converse, a much smaller portion of the business, grew 5% (12% on a currency neutral basis) to $586 million due to strength in North America.By region, North America grew 30% in constant currency, Europe/Middle East and Africa was up 33%, and Asia Pacific and Latin America was higher by 8% and Greater China fell 3% on a reported basis but improved 6% on a currency neutral basis.There are some negatives found within the report. The first is the decline in gross margin, which fell 300 basis points to 42.9%. Still, this was better than expected. Markdown of products occurred mostly in North America due to excess inventory. Inventories were once again high, up 43% to $9.3 billion.Story continuesAccording to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) analysts, Nike is expected to report earnings per share of $3.42 in full fiscal year 2023.TakeawaysTop-line growth was the best that Nike has seen in the trailing 12 months. Revenue results for the past three quarters were up 3.6%, down 0.9% and up 5%, respectively. The earnings per share beat was the widest by far in the most recent quarter.Nikes long-term success is driven by the strength of its brand and the close attention it gives to customer preferences and engagement. This includes going straight to the customer instead of focusing on agreements with retailers. The strength in Nike Direct and e-commerce shows that consumers are responding to the companys investment in this area. The company has leveraged the 160 million active members in its loyalty program to boost results in these channels. This is a massive customer base, one which few, if any, competitors can match.Moving to gross margin, Nikes products are, like most manufactured items, becoming more expensive to make due to higher inflation costs. While some costs can be passed on to customers, not all of these expenses can be. Thus, Nike has seen a decline in gross margin, as wages are not keeping up with inflation, thus reducing consumers' purchasing power. When coupled with markdowns to clear inventory, the margin picture becomes worse. The good news is that the negative impact on gross margin wasnt as bad as expected.Inventories still remain high, which will mean that discounting on products will most likely continue to be an issue. The good news here is that inventories did fall $336 million on a sequential basis. There is still inventory to be cleared, but this could mean that Nike has now seen peak discounting. If so, then margin pressure could begin to abate.The strict policies regarding Covid-19 in China had kept a lid on growth in the region for Nike, but that seems to be changing. The impact is already being felt by the company. Revenue for the region fell 19% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As many of these restrictions have now been lifted or modified, Nike saw a drastic improvement in business in China. As Nikes most important growth region, this will be a significant tailwind to the business if further growth returns following the easing of restrictions in the region.Nikes capital returns to shareholders are very high. The company repurchased 16.5 million shares at an average price of $97 during the last quarter, which is good value considering Wednesdays closing price. In June, Nike authorized an $18 billion share repurchase program to be conducted over a four-year span. The company has $16 billion, or 8.8% of the current market capitalization, remaining on its authorization as of the end of the second quarter.The company also raised its dividend 11.5% for the Dec. 28 payment date, extending Nikes dividend growth streak to 21 years, though the forward dividend yield is still tiny at 1.16%.Valuation analysis and return potentialUsing Morningstar analysts' estimates for the fiscal year, Nike is now trading at 33.8 times earnings estimates. This is considerably higher than the forward price-earnings ratio of 27.8 that shares were trading with the last time I looked at the name.The average price-earnings ratio for the last decade is just under 30 when you remove the artificially high multiple due to Covid-19 in 2020. Nike is now trading a premium to its long-term average valuation.The GF Value chart is much more appealing.Nike Soars on Earnings BeatNike is trading just below $116. With a GF Value of $144.61, the stock has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.80. The stock could gain 24.8% if it were to reach its GF Value. The forward dividend yield added in could bring the total return potential in the mid-20% range.The stock isnt cheap in a historical basis, but Nike has a very high GF Score of 94 out of 100, suggesting the potential for high outperformance based on historical studies conducted by GuruFocus. The GF Score results from top scores for growth, value and profitability, a solid score for financial strength and a middling score for momentum.Nike Soars on Earnings BeatFinal thoughtsNikes second-quarter results had multiple positives, including a return to high levels of revenue growth. Net income was flat and earnings per share was up slightly, but this was a reversal from the declines seen in the first-quarter of the fiscal year.Nikes direct-to-consumer business continues to deliver and e-commerce investments have paid off. Growth was evident in most regions, with China showing a very strong sequential improvement. Inventories remain high, which will pressure gross margin as the company works to clear product.Following the surge in share price, Nike is trading above its historical average levels. This might give value investors pause, but still, I believe the stock is undervalued based on the GF Value chart and growth prospects. However, I would still prefer to wait for a pullback in the share price in order to secure more of a margin of safety.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to see more best upside stocks to buy right now, go directly to 5 Best Upside Stocks to Buy Right Now.Stocks with upside are stocks that have the potential to increase in the future.While every investors' definition of the future is different, long term investors generally view the future as 10 years.Given the decline in the market this year, there are arguably more stocks with upside than before.Because inflation has increased substantially, demand for many companies have weakened as some consumers have looked for lower priced alternatives.Given the higher inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year which has increased borrowing costs and lowered equity valuations as capital has moved from the equity market into the U.S. government bond market.With the Federal Reserve potentially increasing interest rates further next year, many economists think there could be a recession in 2023.As a result of the high inflation, substantial interest rate increases, and the probability of a recession next year, the broader market has declined substantially and a lot of stocks are lower.In the long term, however, it is likely that the Federal Reserve will win its fight against inflation and inflation will normalize. If inflation and interest rates normalize, the U.S. economy could grow faster and there's potential for valuations to increase.If market valuations increase substantially enough, many stocks could rise and hence realize some of their upside.The Best Upside StocksThe best upside stocks are stocks that not only could rally substantially but also have quality businesses with competitive advantages. Generally they would be blue chips that have fallen out of favor for various temporary reasons that might improve sometime in the next ten years.Because they have great businesses, the blue chips are more likely to realize their upside in the long term versus companies that don't have as great of a business.Story continuesBecause they have great businesses, the best upside stocks also arguably have less downside as many have high quality earnings potential.DownsideJust as every stock has an upside, every stock also has a downside. Stocks could decline further if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected or if economic data fails to meet expectations.

Shares of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) fell substantially in 2020 given the pandemic which decreased demand for civilian air travel and the company's earnings per share have not done well ever since despite The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also owning a leading aerospace defense business. While the company lost $2.05 per share in 2021, analysts expect the company to lose $7.93 per share in 2022 given the headwinds.Nevertheless, analysts do think there could be a recovery in the future as they expect The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) to make a profit of $3.70 per share in 2023 and earn $7.04 per share in 2024. Much of the expected profit recovery depends on the rebound on civilian air travel which is far from certain given the uncertainty with the pandemic. As a result, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is arguably a high reward high risk blue chip on our list.Alongside The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a stock with upside that's held by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q3.9. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) shares have declined over 22% year to date given the broader market decline which decreases the company's profitability. In Q3, the company's sales decreased 15% year over year and its adjusted EPS decreased 16% year over year given the headwinds.While the short term is bearish, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) benefits from being a leader in passive ETFs, which is a multi-trillion dollar asset class that's expected to continue to grow in the long term. If BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) maintains its market share and grows its AUM, the company could continue to grow its earnings in the long term.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 46 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q3.8. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leader in producing cutting edge semiconductor producing equipment that's pretty essential for the industry.Considering the semiconductor industry has slowed this year and the tensions between China and the United States have increased, analysts expect the company's EPS to decrease to $14.34 in 2022 from $15.63 per share in 2021. With the headwinds, the company's stock has declined 27% year to date.Nevertheless the semiconductor industry will grow in the long term and analysts expect ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s EPS to rise. In terms of the consensus, analysts expect the company to earn $19.22 per share for 2023 and $23.87 per share for 2024.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Due to high inflation, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a stock that has a great brand that hasn't done well this year given the lower than expected demand and higher inventories. If there is a recession next year, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s EPS might not do very well in 2023 given its apparel and shoes cost more than many competitors.Nevertheless, the global economy will recover in the long run and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)'s EPS could increase substantially in the next ten years if it maintains its market share in the premium apparel and shoe industry.6. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the big four U.S. banks with substantial scale and earnings power. Given the potential for a recession next year in addition to other factors, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock has decreased 25.8% year to date. Furthermore, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) has underperformed some of its other big four bank peers given it doesn't benefit as much from the rising net interest income given its consumer business isn't as big.At the end of the third quarter, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) had a book value per share of $92.71 and a tangible book value per share of $80.34, which is substantially higher than the bank's current price of $44.81 per share.

Despite heavy discounting due to excessive inventory hitting profit margins and causing flat profits on higher sales, the US athleisure company topped estimates. Its European’s peers also gained from Nike's good news, with Puma (PTC: PUMSY) and adidas AG (OTC: ADDYY) both rising roughly 6 per cent in Frankfurt, while JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) jumped 8 per cent in London.Nike did it again, despite a challenging environmentWith high consumer demand that drove a strong business momentum in a dynamic environment, Nike’s management stayed focus on what it can control. Although inventories rose 43% compared to last year, they declined from the previous quarter. For the quarter that ended on November 30th, revenues rose 17 percent to $13.3 billion while profits remained flat compared to the year ago period, amounting to $1.3 billion.Direct sales amounted to $5.4 billion, rising 16 percent for the quarter, with digital sales also rising 25 percent due to record growth in the brand’s digital membership platform.Gross margin declined compared with the prior quarter due to higher markdowns, especially in North America with profit margins also pressured by higher marketing, logistics and freight costs.As for China that was shaped by COVID-19 restrictions, sales did drop 3 percent but, it is still a far more gentle drop compared to prior quarter’s 16%.The success secretChief Financial Officer Matthew Friend explained that the challenging market conditions were offset by strong demand, especially in North America where revenue rose 30% from last year’s comparable period. Nike’s strategy of shifting its sales directly to consumers and becoming a ‘direct-to-consumer’ brand is undoubtedly working.New (streaming) horizonsAs of December 30th, Netflix will start streaming Nike Training Club classes, taking a page from Peloton’s (NASDAQ: PTON). Nike Training Club is the company's fitness app that hosts videos of strength, yoga, and high-intensity interval training. By including Nike's speciality content, Netflix made a smart move to lure exercisers stay on their platform while doing fitness and Nike only continued expanding its already impressive global presence, something it is well known for and that many find to be one of the secrets behind its success.Story continuesDespite costs squeezing margins, Nike now sees its revenue growing for the full fiscal year.

178,1d7e4199-1956-33f5-9167-12698d23ac45,WFC,2022-12-23,Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 74% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-nyse-wfc-110047714.html,1671793247,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Wells Fargo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wells Fargo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.9% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$90m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Wells Fargo has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

These studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of a daily 2mg dose of oral etrasimod in UC patients who had failed treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Both studies achieved their primary endpoint of clinical remission over placebo and all key secondary endpoints.Shares of Pfizer have lost 12.5% in the year against the industry’s 11.0% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, etrasimod, is being evaluated in multiple clinical stages for immuno-inflammatory indications. Apart from UC, etrasimod is being studied across multiple gastroenterology and dermatology indications, including atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, Crohn’s disease and alopecia areata.If approved by the FDA, etrasimod will face competition from Bristol-Myers’ BMY S1P receptor modulator, Zeposia, which was approved as an oral medicine for treating moderately to severely active UC last year. Bristol Myers’ Zeposia is also approved for treating adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The Bristol-Myers drug is also approved for indications in the EU.S1P receptor modulators like etrasimod and Bristol-Myers’ Zeposia represent a different mechanism of action than available UC therapies and represent a new treatment option that can provide symptom relief and remission to patients.Etrasimod was added to Pfizer’s inflammation and immunology pipeline with the acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, which was completed earlier this year in March. The addition of etrasimod helped Pfizer develop a new drug with a different mechanism of action than its currently approved drugs for inflammatory indications. Last year, Pfizer faced a regulatory setback when the FDA asked to add warnings on the label of its key immuno-inflammatory drug Xeljanz about an increased risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots and even death.Story continuesPfizer Inc.

185,6f15a722-9754-3afc-aa52-3a6a9601cf92,PFE,2022-12-23,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-141002510.html,1671718202,STORY,['PFE'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Conagra Brands (CAG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.4%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.67%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.6%. Check Conagra Brands (CAG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;NexPoint Residential Trust Inc. (NXRT) is paying out a dividend of $0.42 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.86% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.83% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 11.36% over the past year. Check NexPoint Residential Trust Inc. (NXRT) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.41 per share, Pfizer (PFE) has a dividend yield of 3.1%. This is compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.46% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.56%. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:PYPL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.67bUS$7.78bUS$8.24bUS$8.41bUS$8.58bUS$8.75bUS$8.92bUS$9.10bUS$9.28bUS$9.46bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 1.98%Est @ 1.98%Est @ 1.98%Est @ 1.98%Est @ 1.98%Est @ 1.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$6.2kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.2kUS$5.9kUS$5.5kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$56bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$162bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$162b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$75bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$132b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$68.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PayPal Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.070. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PayPal HoldingsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For PayPal Holdings, there are three pertinent items you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - PayPal Holdings has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does PYPL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

For more brands, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Brands That Are Great Investments Now.Cover even a basic course in finance and you are likely to come across several different ways to value a company. These range from simple ratios to complex methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis which involves projecting a firm's cash flows into the future and then discounting them back to gain a sense of its fair value. Another popular, and easy, method is market capitalization, which simply multiplies the firm's outstanding shares with its share price.However, capturing the non-intrinsic value of a company - one that is determined by customer goodwill, corporate practices, and brand strength - is more difficult simply due to the qualitative nature of these factors. Calculating this value becomes crucial at the time of mergers or acquisitions, as the acquiring firm often ends up paying a premium for the target if the latter is a strong brand. This premium is called synergy during the acquisition phase, and its value is reflected as goodwill on the balance sheet of the acquiring entity. The balance sheet adjustment has to be made because the price paid for a firm is often higher than the value of its assets, and an adjustment is necessary to balance the 'balance' sheet.Today's piece will look at some of the most valuable brands in the world, and determine if they are also popular with hedge funds.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Best Get Rich Quick Stocks To Buy.During times of high uncertainty, some experts recommend taking the short-term view instead of the long-term view to make quick money. The global economic developments taking place could propel stocks to bounce back from depressed levels and soar to new highs. Given the prevalent inflation rates hovering around a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve could be driven to increase benchmark interest rates aggressively to cool down the economy. The expectation of a rising benchmark interest rate makes the equity market very volatile with lower growth clarity, which is not favorable for stocks in the long term. However, it provides opportunities for investors to take advantage of the depressed stock prices and yield substantial returns in the near future.On December 2, the US Department of Labor reported that 263,000 new jobs were created in November 2022, as opposed to a consensus forecast of 200,000 jobs only. Despite the Fed's repeated rate hikes, the labor market has been remarkably robust, creating 323,000 jobs on average over the past six months. Credit card interest rates are at an all-time peak and are still rising. The cost of auto loans is at an 11-year high, while a 15-year peak has been reached for home equity lines of credit. According to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, the yields on online savings accounts and certificates of deposit haven't been this high since 2008. Stocks like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), and Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) are also attracting hedge fund investment as investors look to protect their savings and earn strong returns.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyWe have shortlisted these stocks based on positive short-term catalysts that could propel stock prices and yield healthy returns to investors. Some of the picks in this article are buy-on-the-dip calls, as these stocks have lost significant value in the past few months but still have a viable business model that could aid the stock price to bounce back. Meanwhile, some stocks are on the rise due to positive investor sentiments following favorable macroeconomic developments. The stocks have been ranked according to the level of hedge fund ownership as of Q3 2022.Story continuesBest Get Rich Quick Stocks To Buy12.

(NYSE:ABG) is working on enhancing shareholder returns by allocating its resources to expand operations and aggressively buyback its stock as well. The dealership market is very fragmented, with 93.5% of the dealerships having a network of one to five locations only. Only 0.1% of the dealers have 50 or more locations.

(NYSE:ABG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“One of our holdings in the distribution theme is Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG), an automobile dealership firm. Asbury’s growth model is through same-store sales growth (4% per year), internet distribution (10% per year), and synergistic M&amp;A (5% per year). These are enhanced by opportunistic operational leverage from scale and share repurchases (5% annual growth). Over the past 10 years, Asbury’s net income margins are up 120% with a 5x increase in revenues. These factors should lead to about a 20% EPS growth going forward. Ashtead has had 19% and 31% EPS growth over the past five and 10 years, respectively.As can be seen below, a large portion of future growth is based upon the growth of internet sales. Both Asbury and Lithia have internet strategies which capture a younger demographic who do not visit dealerships with the same frequency as older folks. Asbury, through its online platform Clicklane, has found internet purchasers have very little overlap with existing customers; 95% are new customers. Asbury’s strategy is to target customers who are within 20 miles of an existing Asbury location vs. online only competitors (like Carvana) and Lithia. Asbury has had a per-store growth rate of 67% over the last year and only sells cars online in about 60% of its current footprint. This growth rate will decline going forward as the markets mature, but it will be bolstered as Clicklane is rolled out to the remaining 40% of Asbury’s footprint…” (Click here to read the full text)In addition to Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Linde plc, BP p.l.c, and PayPal Holdings, Inc.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Linde, the maker of industrial gases, have held up better than the peer group as well as the broader market. The stock is down -5% this year vs. the decline of -8.2% for the Zacks Diversified Chemicals industry and -7.3% decline for the Zacks Basic Materials sector.Driving the stock's momentum is the wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company's primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals. Its process gas, like hydrogen, is being utilized for clean fuels, while its high-purity and specialty gases are employed to manufacture electronics.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. The firm reported strong third-quarter results, owing to increased prices and volumes across all end markets, except for healthcare.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BP shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+28.9% vs. +15.9%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. BP boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.It set an aggressive energy transition plan to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy. Although there is no production from its Russia incorporated joint ventures, BP is projecting higher upstream volumes this year. Before reporting its December-quarter results, the energy major is willing to complete an additional $2.5 billion in share buy-backs.However, the leading integrated energy company's balance sheet is considerably more leveraged than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing production &amp; manufacturing costs have been affecting the company's income.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PayPal have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (-63.6% vs. -62.5%). The company trimmed its guidance for revenue growth in anticipation of an economic downturn, which might slow down consumer spending. This is a major negative. Further, intensifying market competition and foreign exchange headwinds remain risks.However, PayPal's third quarter results were driven by strong growth in total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement was a positive. Strong performance by Venmo contributed well to the TPV growth. The Zacks analyst believes growing transaction revenues are likely to continue driving the top-line growth.Also, solid momentum across peer to peer and PayPal Checkout experiences is a tailwind. Further, PayPal's growing traction in the United States remains a major positive. Considering the above-mentioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect net revenues in 2022 to rise 8.4% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on PayPal here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BHP Group Ltd. and Kimberly-Clark Corp..Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) which includes new applications, new approvals, rolling approvals, and rolling denials.

If you want to read about some more auto stocks, go directly to 5 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks in the World.The auto industry is made up of companies that manufacture and distribute vehicles and vehicle parts. Public automotive companies are now increasing in number as many electric vehicle (EV) startups and suppliers have gone public through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in the past few years. The electrification of the auto industry is nothing short of a revolution, and some of these start-ups will likely be major players in future. Automotive stocks can be important contributors to an investment portfolio because they rise and fall with consumer confidence, and can be useful indicators for economic trouble or a recovery.Despite the automotive market suffering from the pandemic crisis, the vehicle sales in the US went down 38% during the 2020 lockdown, the market has now recovered well and continues to grow. The demand for EVs has increased as travel resumes worldwide and virus restrictions become a thing of the past. This increase has led to a dramatic shortage of chips, now essential to the manufacture of vehicles, driving down production but increasing overall prices, with mixed results for the auto industry across the globe. Some of the top stocks in the auto sector include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), among others discussed in detail below. In addition to manufacturers in the US, car makers from Europe, Japan, and China are also leading players in the industry. In the first half of 2022, high-margin SUVs, trucks and luxury vehicles gained market share over other cars. In the second quarter of the year, electric vehicle sales rose 66% in the US.In a macro drop where inflation and rising rates have battered the economy, the automobile sector has managed to resist pressures and post modest gains. Heading to 2023, the automotive industry will remain vulnerable to global headwinds due to the energy crisis, slower global demand and continued supply chain problems. An EIU report on automotive outlook 2023 shows that globally, new vehicle sales will remain flat in 2023 and new car sales will rise by 0.9% and new commercial vehicle sales will fall by 1.3% due to an expected recession. Story continuesHowever, the sales of electric vehicles are expected to be the bright spots, growing by 25% in the period. Analysts are also predicting that new car sales in western Europe will decline by about 3%, while they will fall by 2.4% in North America. EV sales numbers from emerging economies like Brazil, India, and Indonesia remain disappointing, accounting for less than 1% of the total market share and not registering a significant increase in 2022. This could change as more car brands, especially in Japan, transition to fully electric vehicles.Another important trend that investors should keep in mind is that the emergence of new EV models and the extension in government subsidies for the sector will likely contribute to the EV boom across the world in the coming year. In the US and Europe, electric car sales are rapidly rising. EVs now account for nearly 5% of the car market share in the US. Norway and Germany remain the strongest European EV markets. It is also noteworthy that the conversations around the automotive sector in the media tend to focus on the electric revolution in the industry and the pivot towards new energy vehicles by big carmakers. However, the used cars market barely gets any attention. This is surprising since used car sales have outstripped the sale of new vehicles in the United States over the past decade. This is another trend to be mindful of when investing in the auto space.Our MethodologyThe companies that have upcoming growth catalysts and operate in the auto sector were selected for the list. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks in the WorldPhoto by carlos aranda on UnsplashFastest Growing Auto Stocks in the World10.

Rosner sees fourth-quarter earnings coming in at $1.05 per share, below current analyst forecasts for $1.24.The auto analyst says the estimate cuts reflect some economic weakness in China, as well as the postponement of deliveries into the first quarter in the U.S. from some consumers to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act’s EV incentives.Shares of Tesla have crashed nearly 70% from a high on Jan. 3 of this year. The stock is down over 34% so far this month alone.Most of the losses for Tesla investors started after CEO Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter in April, a deal that closed in late October and is perhaps just as concerning among investors as slowing global sales.Those losses have returned aggressively in December on worries Musk's chaotic leadership of Twitter will hurt Tesla.Rosner isn't alone on Wall Street in having reservations on Tesla's fundamentals entering 2023, excluding the sideshow that has become Musk and Twitter.""It's very concerning about the weakness that we're seeing in China,"" Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We are seeing incentives go up, and sales actually are not increasing there. And [a] driving concern is: Are we going to start seeing that in the U.S. and Europe? Is that just sort of the early days of softening demand? And I think that is really more of the large institutional investors' top concern.""To that end, Tesla said on its website Wednesday it will offer $7,500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. in December.Story continuesTesla shares fell more than 8% in Thursday's session.Tesla logo and Elon Musk silhouette are seen in this illustration taken, December 19, 2022.

202,7c1f30fd-4d0a-3ed9-8d76-610b6b9c6ec2,GM,2022-12-23,Investors Heavily Search General Motors Company (GM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-general-motors-140002802.html,1671717602,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -10.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 16.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.05 points to a change of -0.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.15 indicates a change of -12.8% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $41.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +23.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $154.76 billion and $159.98 billion estimates indicate +21.9% and +3.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $41.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.4%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.83 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +19.05%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

COTY announced the sale of the Lacoste fragrance license back to the latter in a mutual deal. This will help Coty focus on its biggest fragrance licenses alongside speeding up its deleveraging plan via the sale proceeds.Lacoste men’s fragrances garnered a premium+ market position under Coty’s management over the last six years. The brand is now set to renew its approach and fuel growth. Hence, the exit from this licensing deal is likely to be beneficial for Coty and Lacoste.Coty Focuses on Growth via Alliances &amp; BuyoutsCoty has made several strategic partnerships to enhance its brand portfolio. On Nov 18, 2021, Coty signed a licensing agreement with Orveda — an ultra-premium skincare brand made in France.Prior to this, Coty entered into a multi-channel agreement with Perfect Corp. — a well-known beauty tech solutions provider. On Mar 3, 2021, the company signed a letter of intent to partner with LanzaTech — a pioneer in producing next-generation green and sustainable ingredients.Moreover, COTY’s buyout of the iconic Burberry brand has been yielding favorably. This acquisition has been supporting growth in the Prestige segment. Additionally, the company’s buyout of Procter &amp; Gamble Company’s global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with select hair styling brands (the P&amp;G Beauty Business) in 2016, has been noteworthy.What’s More?Coty has been benefiting from its focus on six strategic pillars aimed at sustainable growth. These include stabilizing Consumer Beauty make-up brands and mass fragrances, accelerating luxury fragrances and setting up Coty as a core player in prestige make-up.The strategic priorities also include establishing a skincare portfolio in prestige and mass channels, strengthening e-commerce and Direct-to-Consumer capabilities, growing its presence in China via Prestige and certain Consumer Beauty brands and setting Coty as an industry leader in sustainability.On its last earnings call, management stated that it continues to witness solid demand growth in almost all markets, especially Prestige fragrances.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Pinnacle West (PNW), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Pinnacle West currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if PNW is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this power company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For PNW, shares are up 0.52% over the past week while the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry is down 1.05% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.39% compares favorably with the industry's 1% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Pinnacle West have increased 12.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 12.98% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 2.78% and -15.22%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PNW's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PNW is averaging 935,778 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PNW.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PNW's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.01 to $4.09 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PNW is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Pinnacle West on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

217,54413504-cc60-3068-bfe9-29b80bbeecf2,ISRG,2022-12-23,"With 85% institutional ownership, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-institutional-ownership-intuitive-surgical-120043303.html,1671796843.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TROW']","[If you want to know who really controls Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Intuitive Surgical does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Intuitive Surgical, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Intuitive Surgical is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.9% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$425m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Analog Devices due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Analog Devices Beats Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenue EstimatesAnalog Devices reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.73 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. The bottom line rose 58% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Revenues of $3.25 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.16 billion. The top line improved 39% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.The strong performance delivered by Analog Devices across the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications markets drove the top line.Revenues by End MarketsIndustrial: Analog Devices generated revenues of $1.66 billion (accounting for 51% of the total revenues), which grew 40% year over year.Communications: Revenues from the market were $501.9 million (15% of revenues), increasing 42% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Automotive: Revenues from the market summed $672.3 million (21% of revenues), up 49% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.Consumer: The market generated revenues of $411.9 million (13% of revenues), reflecting 19% growth from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.Operating DetailsThe adjusted gross margin expanded 310 basis points (bps) from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to 74%.Adjusted operating expenses were $743.7 million, up 14.3% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.

224,86f58037-94c0-3423-88c1-963a157f24e7,RF,2022-12-23,3 Best Performing S&P 500 Bank Stocks of 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-performing-p-500-131001618.html,1671714601,STORY,"['RF', 'HBAN', 'RF-PC', '^GSPC']","[The year 2022 has been turbulent for the banking industry. It started on an encouraging note, with the Federal Reserve ending the low-interest rate regime (at present, the short-term interest rates are at a 15-year high of 4.50%) to control persistent inflation. After two years of COVID-19-related mayhem and ambiguity, banks witnessed robust improvement in the lending scenario. These factors, along with initiatives taken to support fee income, majorly supported their top-line growth.But as the year progressed, several other macroeconomic and geopolitical matters, including global supply-chain disruptions and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, wreaked havoc with investors’ confidence. Also, as inflation turned out to be more “sticky” than expected, the central bank was forced to take unprecedented measures to tackle the same. This ultra-aggressive monetary policy stance has led market participants to expect an economic slowdown or recession in 2023.These headwinds turned investors bearish toward the banking stocks. So far this year, the S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index has declined 17.4%. Almost all banks lost value this year, with some less impacted than others. Today, we will discuss the three best-performing S&amp;P 500 banks – Regions Financial Corporation RF, M&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated HBAN – of 2022.Before we proceed to check out these three top-performing banks in detail, let’s see how they have fared. The chart below shows the price performance of these banks in the year-to-date period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegions FinancialRegions Financial is a Birmingham, AL-based financial holding company providing retail and commercial and mortgage banking, and other financial services. RF operates through four business segments – Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, Wealth Management and Others.Regions Financial keeps exploring opportunities for bolt-on buyouts, primarily in mortgage servicing rights, besides adding capabilities in the wealth management division. As the company is committed to diversifying its revenue streams, such endeavors will likely support growth in the long term.Further, Regions Financial’s asset-sensitive position will benefit majorly from the rising rate environment. Its acquisition of EnerBank, strong lending pipeline and strategic asset growth are expected to contribute to net interest income (NII) increase.Regions Financial has a solid balance sheet position. Its robust cash position shows the ability to meet debt obligations if the economic situation worsens. The company’s strong balance sheet and consistent earnings make its capital-deployment activities sustainable. The bank has a dividend yield of 3.86% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 13.4%. At present, RF's payout ratio is 37% of earnings.The stock has lost 3.4% so far this year. While the company’s earnings are projected to witness a year-over-year decline of 6.4% this year, the same is expected to rise 6.7% for 2023. The company currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Story continuesM&amp;T BankM&amp;T Bank Corporation, headquartered in Buffalo, NY, is the holding company for M&amp;T Bank and Wilmington Trust, National Association. MTB operates in New York, MD, New Jersey, PA, Delaware, CT, Virginia, WV and the District of Columbia.Organic growth, driven by higher fee income, rising rates and solid loans and deposits, will likely continue leading to revenue growth for MTB. The company is growing inorganically backed by a sound liquidity position. The acquisition of People's United Financial (completed April 2022) for $8.3 billion is expected to be accretive to its earnings and realize cost savings of $330 million by early 2023.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company seems to be well-positioned in terms of its liquidity profile and is likely to be able to continue meeting its debt obligations if the economic situation worsens. Also, the bank has come a long way in displaying its capital strength, as indicated by its impressive capital deployment activities. The company has a dividend yield of 3.42% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 8.9%. Also, MTB's payout ratio is 36% of earnings at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the year-to-date period, MTB stock has declined 6.9%. For 2022 and 2023, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 4.6% and 34.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Huntington BancsharesColumbus, OH-based Huntington Bancshares is a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company. Its inorganic expansion moves and growth in loans and deposits balance are expected to drive long-term growth.Over the past years, Huntington Bancshares has expanded its footprint with a number of acquisitions. In 2021, it closed the merger with TCF Financial Corporation, thus becoming one of the top 25 U.S. bank holding companies. The company is also expanding via acquisitions to bolster its fee income and digital capabilities. Such steps have strengthened HBAN’s position in existing markets and established a presence in new markets.With the Fed aggressively raising interest rates and expectations of a similar stance in the near term, Huntington’s NII is expected to witness robust growth. Also, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) bank has a steady capital deployment plan in place. HBAN has a dividend yield of 4.5% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 6.4%. Also, the company’s payout ratio is 43% of earnings at present.So far this year, the stock has declined 9.2%. For 2022 and 2023, the company’s earnings are projected to rise 36.1% and 5.8%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-140002579.html,1671717602,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned -2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.28 points to a change of +10.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.47 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.66 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $31.73 billion and $35.19 billion estimates indicate +8.3% and +10.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This brings the mining giant a step closer to closing in on its biggest acquisition in the decade. This takeover would significantly enhance its exposure to future-facing commodities while adding attractive synergies.The execution of the Scheme Implementation Deed follows the completion of a four-week exclusive due diligence period. OZ Mineral’s Board has unanimously recommended that the company’s shareholders vote in favor of the acquisition. A meeting of OZ Mineral’s shareholders is expected to be held in late March or early April 2023.BHP made its first offer to acquire OZ Minerals Limited for AUD25 per share on Aug 7, 2022. Its Board had rejected the offer citing that it undervalues the company and was not in the best interests of shareholders. On Nov 18, BHP raised its offer price to A$28.25 per share which represented a 49.3% premium to OZ Minerals’ closing price on Aug 5, 2022 — the last trading day prior to BHP’s initial proposal.OZ Minerals has a high-quality portfolio of copper and nickel assets, located in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction with long mine lives and first-quartile cost positioning.  It owns and operates Prominent Hill, a high-quality copper-gold mine, and Carrapateena, an iron-oxide-copper–gold underground mine, both located in the highly prospective Gawler Craton in South Australia.The Carajás East Hub located in Brazil is also part of its portfolio. This hub comprises the Pedra Branca underground mine, which is the beginning of a potential series of small, high-quality copper-gold mines with ore being processed at existing facilities at the nearby, now-depleted Antas mine.This deal, which values OZ Minerals at AUD9.6 billion ($6.4 billion), would further BHP’s efforts to boost its supplies of copper and nickel, and enable  its strategy to capitalize on the surging demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy.

The two had been friends since college and together they launched 3C Communication and Culture, a consulting business based in Madison, Alabama.""That was a really difficult time for me,"" says Oti. ""I wasn't sure if I would go on. But then I thought one of the best things to honor Jared would be to make sure his dream became a reality.""As the visionary strategist for the company, Oti was facing a professional challenge: Jared had managed day-to-day operations. ""I knew I needed help to really understand the business,"" she says. Oti turned to Verizon Small Business Digital Ready.Using the free resources available online, Oti found guidance and inspiration. She took online courses in marketing. The lessons about improving social media strategy and website design helped increase online traffic to 3C. She learned to seek outside guidance on the company's finances, networked with local connections, and put workflow procedures into place.For a busy entrepreneur, the structure of the courses worked. ""I love the way Verizon courses are set up,"" Oti says. ""I don't have a whole lot of time to get a master's degree in marketing, accounting and business process engineering. They give you very succinct, 30-minute courses.""Oti's personal history also fueled her determination to succeed. Her single mother sold fish and raised poultry in their home country of Guyana to raise the money that moved the family to the United States. ""Being an entrepreneur is important for me,"" said Oti. ""I saw what happened to my mom in divorce. It's very important for me as a woman to be able to financially support myself.""Working with Digital Ready, Oti not only picked up business knowledge, but also a community. ""I was able to connect with small business entrepreneurs, just like myself,"" she says about her work in group mentorship sessions and monthly Community Connect events.Story continuesThe networking groups serve as a safe place for entrepreneurs to share ideas, problems, and opportunities. ""It's a no judgment zone,"" she says. ""In each forum, I felt like I was contributing. I feel empowered to help others and that helps me to get through tough days.""With that support, Oti is thriving and leading her company to new heights. 3C recently secured two new contracts. Marketing classes inspired Oti to revamp her website, notably increasing traffic. The financial advice courses saved her ""thousands of dollars.""On top of it all, she's proud to be following the approach her dear friend Critchefield originally mapped out for the company.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) which includes new applications, new approvals, rolling approvals, and rolling denials.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, NVIDIA's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA peKeen to find out how analysts think NVIDIA's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, NVIDIA would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 28%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 144% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 17% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why NVIDIA is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that NVIDIA maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for NVIDIA  you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than NVIDIA.

The slow economic growth has increased the risks of a global recession.

248,5a1ae0ee-5231-32b1-8a19-dd73507332eb,TRV,2022-12-23,4 Insurance Stocks That Have Outperformed S&P 500 YTD,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-insurance-stocks-outperformed-p-145902876.html,1671721142,STORY,"['AIG', 'TRV', 'ACGLP', '^GSPC']","[Economic uncertainty worsened in the first half of 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sluggish economic growth, rising interest rates, and soaring inflation. Improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level have been tailwinds for the insurance industry. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates and an improving rate environment have also added to the upside.The insurance industry has declined 0.4% year to date compared with the Finance sector’s decrease of 16.5% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decline of 21.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere are four insurance stocks that have managed to perform well so far this year backed by their strong fundamentals.  Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. KNSL and American International Group, Inc. AIG have outperformed the industry, the sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite year to date. These stocks are poised to retain the rally, given solid prospects.Factors at PlayPer Global Insurance Market Index released by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 6% in the third quarter of 2022. It marked the 20th consecutive quarter of price increases. Per the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate premium growth of 2.1% on average over the next two years. A declining level of inflation, solid life insurance demand and market hardening in property and casualty lines should continue to support the growth.An expanded distribution, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal, price increases, the appointment of retail agents, and a solid balance sheet have boosted insurers’ momentum. The insurance industry players are well poised for growth on the back of higher new business premiums, growth in the line of business, increase in agency renewal written premiums, improving return on equity and non-cat property losses, and expanding international business.Diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk, is also a positive. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, benefited sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, global life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023.The property and casualty insurance industry remains exposed to severe weather events that make underwriting results and in turn earnings volatile. Per Swiss Re Institute, natural catastrophe activity has resulted in insured losses of $115 billion in so far 2022, which is higher than the 10-year average of $81 billion. Swiss Re estimated Hurricane Ian as the most expensive one with estimated preliminary insured losses of $50 billion to $65 billion. Nevertheless, prudent underwriting, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development have helped to maintain underwriting profitability.A near-zero interest rate environment concerns insurers as it weighs on investment income, one of the important components of insurers’ top line. A larger invested base, directing funds to alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, is expected to drive the metric in the future. Seven rate hikes have been implemented by the Fed so far in 2022. In the last monetary policy meeting of 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 bps to the range of 4.25 to 4.5%.A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions, invest in growth initiatives, engage in share buybacks, and increase dividends or pay out special dividends. Mergers and alliances boost portfolios, diversify operations into new business lines and geography and have enabled them to enter more profitable market segments. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, the insurance industry witnessed 427 completed deals in the first half of 2022, which increased 16% year over year.The insurance industry players continue to invest in technology like robotic process automation, Chatbot and RoboAdvisory, artificial intelligence and data analytics, insurtech solutions, telematics, cloud computing. These investments have expedited business operations, enhanced internal efficiency and bolstered data and analytics capabilities and saveed costs which in turn will benefit margins.Story continuesSolid Picks for Better ReturnsWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected four insurance stocks that rallied year to date and are poised to retain the momentum next year.Pembroke, Bermuda, Arch Capital Group is a leading specialty P&amp;C and mortgage insurer and offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance worldwide.

Another popular, and easy, method is market capitalization, which simply multiplies the firm's outstanding shares with its share price.However, capturing the non-intrinsic value of a company - one that is determined by customer goodwill, corporate practices, and brand strength - is more difficult simply due to the qualitative nature of these factors. Calculating this value becomes crucial at the time of mergers or acquisitions, as the acquiring firm often ends up paying a premium for the target if the latter is a strong brand. This premium is called synergy during the acquisition phase, and its value is reflected as goodwill on the balance sheet of the acquiring entity. The balance sheet adjustment has to be made because the price paid for a firm is often higher than the value of its assets, and an adjustment is necessary to balance the 'balance' sheet.Today's piece will look at some of the most valuable brands in the world, and determine if they are also popular with hedge funds.

We are confident in Humana’s value creation plan and ability to get back to market enrollment growth in addition to an increasing contribution from its health care services businesses. Shares of Texas Instruments outperformed as the COVID lockdowns eased in China, and customers could accept the product shipments leading to an upside in expectations.”8.

It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large-cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large-cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.

Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57  Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) manufactures and distributes various equipment worldwide.

The Federal Reserve recently raised interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.25%-4.5% to curb inflation. The tightened monetary policy, looming fears of recession, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising commodity prices and supply-chain headwinds have compelled investors to look for safe and profitable investment options with growth potential.Why Growth Stocks?Growth stocks are a lucrative way to channelize the investments, as these stocks with above-average financial growth can easily capture the market's attention and generate higher returns. Investing in such stocks can fetch solid returns over the long and short run. Growth stocks include companies having the potential to exceed the overall market growth over time with higher profits and revenues.With the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it much easier to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Why Invest in Dividend-Paying Stocks?Investors generally look for safe and profitable stocks apart from focusing on growth investments. This is easily catered by stocks that pay regular quarterly dividend as these have a stable profit stream with a strong balance sheet. Investing in dividend stocks is also appealing for investors seeking a regular income stream or making wealth by reinvesting dividend payments into capital accumulation. Traditionally, dividend stocks are low-risk investments and are safe to hold.Apart from boosting profits and lowering portfolio risks for investors, dividend stocks offer fundamental analysis and tax advantages.

While recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. At this stage, one way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. CHEF, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS, Enphase Energy, Inc. ENPH, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Fabrinet FN are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success.

260,f99ba7fc-9d82-3d6a-92c5-ee1d1082d964,UA,2022-12-23,Under Armour names Marriott’s Stephanie Linnartz as new CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/under-armour-names-marriott-stephanie-205555438.html,1671742555,VIDEO,"['UA', 'UAA']","[Yahoo Finance Live looks to Under Armour's stock after naming its new incumbent CEO.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: Current Marriott International president Stephanie Linnartz will now be Under Armour's new chief executive. Linnartz has been at Marriott for over 25 years and comes to Under Armour with little retail experience. Wall Street analysts a bit mixed on the reaction there with the stock. Wells Fargo lowering its price target from $20 to $14. Baird and Telsey upping their target slightly to $10 and $11 respectively.But really, I want to focus on what one analyst had to say here, Dave. David Swartz at Morningstar said he has fair value on shares at $15.50. And he likes the move because it reminds him of what Nike did with CEO John Donahoe in 2020. And that's because of the new CEO here for Under Armour's experience in digital sales and digital marketing. That's an area Nike grew a ton over the last two years somewhere where Under Armour's sort of been lagging. I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with that.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, there's a lot of ways they are trailing Nike, needless to say. But what we learned in this most recent quarterly report from Nike is the real asset probably is the thing they're executing the best is digitally. They know exactly when, where, and why you're buying your shoes. And that is a huge advantage over competitors. Also like a couple of competitors in naming a female CEO. Dick's and Foot Locker also in that space, long dominated by male CEOs. That's nice to see as well.JARED BLIKRE: I'll tell you what, you want to look at the digital divide? I've got a chart looking at this on the YFi Interactive. And this goes back to the 2000s, since the IPO. This is UAA in its heyday here. And this is trying to struggle with the digital divide. It's basically been in a sideways trading range for the last five years. Now it sits at the lower end. So pretty bleak technical picture there. A turnaround strategy would be very welcome.]"

The opening bell on Wall Street just a few moments away. So let's hit a few Yahoo Finance trending tickers on this Thursday morning. Search is over for Under Armour's next CEO after the company hired Marriott's president Stephanie Linnartz to take the helm.Really, I would say, good hire. Stephanie has been on with us numerous times. She was really instrumental in driving the rewards program over there at Marriott, but also struck a lot of key, I believe, NFL and sports deals for Marriott, which will, of course, benefit her at Under Armour.I know she is very excited about taking this position. She will start at the end of February. Good hire, Under Armoour. And really, I think she's going to be missed a lot by Marriott. CEO Tony Capuano putting out a very classy press release yesterday, just explaining the departure and everything she has meant to the company.BRAD SMITH: I think this is a great hire for Under Armour. I mean, you've seen within the athleisure space, of course, that more of the companies in the athletic apparel and footwear category that are continually trying to increase their touch base with women and with a core purchaser, especially not just for the household, but especially within athletic apparel and footwear.And we've seen that across Lululemon, Nike shifted their strategy over the past couple of years as well. And so for Under Armour, perhaps its next leg of growth can continue to really glean the insights of exactly how it can tap better into some of its core customers and where.I think this is also signaling is just another effort to make sure that there are more women who are holding CEO positions in the S&amp;P 500. Only 33 companies in the S&amp;P 500 as of December 2022, which is about 6.6% of the S&amp;P 500, have female CEOs.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and as you can see, of the Fortune 500, it's, what, something like 44 right now. It's up 7%, but 44 out of 500 is still not a great percentage. I wanted to mention as well, you guys are sort of echoing what a lot of analysts are saying in terms of this being a good pick. But let's also be clear, she's got her work cut out for her.BRIAN SOZZI: Absolutely.JULIE HYMAN: Right? Like, this is not going to be an easy job. You saw what the stock has done over the past year. And Patrik Frisk, the former CEO, cut costs, tried to get things back in shape, didn't quite get it there. And as always, there is the added trick of working for Kevin Plank, right? Whenever you are at a company and you're the CEO, and the founder, chairman is still hanging around, that does add a little bit of a layer of complexity here. So we'll see how this all plays out.BRIAN SOZZI: Kevin is a very big personality. He's also still a very large shareholder in Under Armour. So best believe he is going to have influence on this company. But if he wants to start turning this brand around finally, he's going to have to let Stephanie just take the reins and lead the business like she wants to lead. And she deserves to lead, given 25+ year successfully at Marriott.BRAD SMITH: Broadly, on the whole, hopefully that there are more transitions like this where you do have more representation on a gender basis across the S&amp;P 500, across the markets, more broadly. Especially as recently as a couple of years back, NASDAQ put into place the diversity rule for their companies. Perhaps that creates more of a pipeline going forward.JULIE HYMAN: And it got a lot of backlash for that rule, by the way.BRAD SMITH: It did. It did, yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Which is amazing to me that that is still controversial at this point in time.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy. A widow and orphan stock refers to an equity investment that pays a steady dividend and is generally considered to be low-risk, defensive, and non-volatile. These are usually large-cap, stable, and old-economy companies in non-cyclical business sectors. Dividends provide investors with a margin of safety despite the challenging environment for the capital markets, and dividend equities have outperformed non-dividend equities and bonds year-to-date.Investing in dividends, primarily those firms that increase their payouts on a year-over-year basis, can make massive contributions to long-term portfolio returns in an otherwise volatile market. Looking for the highest-yielding dividend stock is usually associated with higher risk. Investors should focus on picking up stocks which have a consistent track record of growing their dividends year after year. Nick Lentini of the Morgan Stanley Equity Strategy team said on November 9: “The investing backdrop of the past year, driven by macroeconomic conditions and combined with the rising risk of recession, have fueled outperformance for many dividend-paying stocks.”Sectors which are positioned to grow their dividends consistently include Energy, Packaged Food, Beverages and Household Products, Utilities, and Banks. Some of the best widow and orphan stocks to buy include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Our Methodology We selected the following widow and orphan stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and growing dividends over the last 30 years or more. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To BuyPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashBest Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy10. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of December 21: 4.98%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) was founded in 1901 and is based in Deerfield, Illinois. The company operates as an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retailer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and internationally. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has three segments – U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International, and U.S. Healthcare. The company paid a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on December 12 and has 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. On December 14, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $36 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst believes managed care and drug distributors' earnings visibility remains attractive, but she thinks hospitals have the most improved outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) at the end of September 2022, compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 6 million shares worth $186.5 million. In addition to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the best widow and orphan stocks to consider for a safe portfolio. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

The collective stakes in Q3 2022 increased to $4.13 billion from $2.93 billion in Q2. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.55 million shares worth $811.3 million. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)6. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Dividend Yield as of December 21: 1.89%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an Illinois-based company that discovers, develops, and manufactures healthcare products worldwide. It operates in four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On December 9, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, an 8.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.47. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 13. 2022 marks the company's 51st consecutive year of dividend growth.On December 12, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch raised the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $114 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Looking into 2023, ""many headwinds remain"" for the North America medical supplies and technology group, but these should ease in the second half of next year, alleviating operating margin pressures, the analyst wrote in a research noteAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 62 hedge funds were long Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a premier widow and orphan stock to buy. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Travel Stocks To Buy13 Best New Tech Stocks To Buy12 Best Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But this wasn't a new issue to those of us working day in and day out to achieve digital equity together with partners in the government, nonprofits, and even other companies.Today, the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Media and Broadband is examining these continued efforts across the public and private sectors to close the digital divide and connect every American to the power of the Internet.I'm immensely proud to work at Comcast, an organization that has been at the forefront of the challenge to achieve digital equity once and for all. We've been at it for over a decade and our Internet Essentials program is the largest and most successful broadband adoption initiative in the industry.This hearing will provide a view into much of the work being done to bring the Internet to more and more people, and crucially, ensure that folks have the skills needed to truly unlock the possibilities available online. Witnesses will include Kimball Sekaquaptewa, the Chair of Connect New Mexico and Chief Technology Director for the Santa Fe Indian School; Hon. Michael Powell, President &amp; CEO of NCTA; Jonathan Spalter, President &amp; CEO of USTelecom; and Angela Siefer, Executive Director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA).Internet Essentials was Comcast's first company-wide effort to ensure all Americans can benefit from the power of broadband. It provided eligible households in Xfinity service areas with a low-cost broadband option, as well as the ability to purchase an affordable computer and access to basic digital literacy training.Over the years Comcast's commitment to working with communities to achieve digital equity has only grown. We've continuously improved and expanded Internet Essentials by making more households eligible, increasing speeds, and adding free public WiFi hotspots. And we launched Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to digital equity.Story continuesAt its heart, Project UP is a recognition that digital equity only starts with a connection.In order to advance economic mobility, and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers, and creators we must look beyond access to support broadband adoption and invest in digital skills - and community-based organizations are our greatest partners in this.With our Project UP partners, we are meeting the need to support both national and local organizations to achieve our shared goals together.Digital Navigators, trusted voices for those who don't know how to sign up for Internet service - including through the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), get a device, or connect to skills training and other resources - are critical to closing the digital divide and reducing socioeconomic inequalities.That's why one of the Project UP partnerships I'm most excited about is our work with NDIA to train and build capacity for Digital Navigator programs, so other community groups across the country can equip more folks with the tools they need to succeed.On the broadband deployment side, we're excited to engage with state and local governments to form public-private partnerships to expand Comcast's ultrafast gig-speed network to even more homes in rural areas.Just last month, we celebrated the completion of one such expansion project in Hampton County, South Carolina - bringing broadband connectivity to more than 2,000 homes. House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn spoke at the ribbon cutting for the network, demonstrating the momentous nature of this project.There are dozens of stories like this nationwide right now, like in New Mexico, where Comcast was one recipient of the Connect New Mexico pilot program to connect thousands of homes to the Internet for the first time; and in West Virginia, where the state recently announced a partnership with Comcast to connect more than 2,100 homes.It's clear that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to closing the digital divide, and we're proud to stand side by side with connectivity advocates and governments at every level to achieve our goal.Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy &amp; Executive Vice President, Digital Equity.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: http://www.comcastcorporation.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733049/The-Road-to-Digital-Equity-Where-Weve-Been-and-Where-Were-Going]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) which includes new applications, new approvals, rolling approvals, and rolling denials.

(NASDAQ:NWL) Improve Its Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newell-brands-inc-nasdaq-nwl-154936444.html,1671724176,STORY,['NWL'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Newell Brands How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Newell Brands is:15% = US$565m ÷ US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.15 in profit.Does Newell Brands Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Newell Brands has a lower ROE than the average (23%) in the Consumer Durables industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Newell Brands by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Newell Brands' Debt And Its 15% Return On EquityNewell Brands clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.56. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Newell Brands may not be the best stock to buy.

This has dragged the stock prices of many companies in 2022, incurring portfolio losses for many investors. While Fed’s recent interest announcement has brought solace, it is still difficult to predict the market’s future movement.In a jittery market, it is wise to constantly re-evaluate one’s portfolio holdings and shuffle them by picking market-relevant stocks poised for future growth. Here, dividend-paying stocks turn out to be a good choice. Stocks paying regular dividends are large, stable and well-established.Companies generally payout dividends from their profits after securing enough funds for reinvestment in business operations, growth and expansion. This indicates that dividend-paying stocks are typically more secure and reliable.The dividend aristocrats, companies with a history of increasing their dividends annually for the past 25 years, are safe investment options for the long term.Although dividend stocks are reliable, a stock paying the highest dividend or having a high dividend yield may not always be a great option. A good way to evaluate a dividend stock is to analyze whether the dividend paid is stable. Also, companies with efficient management and a healthy balance sheet are considered good choices.Our ChoicesWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down on five cheap dividend stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

This ratio is obtained by dividing a stock's current market price by its historical or estimated earnings. It tells how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings.In fact, the golden rule is – the lower the P/E of a stock, the higher its value will be for investors. This is because value investors believe that a stock's current market price is not reflective of its historical/future earnings and, therefore, chances of outperformance are higher.But there is another side to the story that points to stocks with an increasing P/E. But this often-overlooked trend can prove pivotal in finding great stocks.How Can Rising P/E Be Helpful?Investors should note that stock prices move in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock soars. Solid quarterly earnings and guidance in turn boost the earnings forecast, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock's fundamental strength, expect some strong positives out of it as well as solid and faster earnings growth. Moreover, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.Here are five out of the 27 stocks:Clovis Oncology: Clovis Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in ResMed's (NYSE:RMD) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on ResMed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$5.2b - US$693m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, ResMed has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for ResMed roceIn the above chart we have measured ResMed's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for ResMed.So How Is ResMed's ROCE Trending?The trends we've noticed at ResMed are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 23%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 43%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, ResMed has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing ResMed that you might find interesting.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Marine Harvest ASA and Mondelez are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MHGVY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MDLZ has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.MHGVY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.52, while MDLZ has a forward P/E of 22.78. We also note that MHGVY has a PEG ratio of 0.47. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MDLZ currently has a PEG ratio of 3.36.Another notable valuation metric for MHGVY is its P/B ratio of 2.31. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MDLZ has a P/B of 3.43.Based on these metrics and many more, MHGVY holds a Value grade of B, while MDLZ has a Value grade of C.Story continuesMHGVY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MDLZ, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MHGVY is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With help from the company's Global Community Engagement team, employees are empowered to donate their time, talent and resources to address the most pressing needs around them in three focus areas: health, education and supporting communities. In 2021 alone, Boston Scientific employees spent 50,000+ hours volunteering in 50+ countries.Take a look at four recent initiatives from around the world that illustrate a belief long held by Boston Scientific: transforming the world begins one community at a time.Fit for a CauseIn January 2022, Boston Scientific employees in Massachusetts and Rhode Island were invited to join a six-week fitness challenge called Fit for a Cause. Entrants signed up to join one of three teams, each of which was led by two company employees.Teams scored points by doing activities including cardio and strength training sessions, incorporating a new fruit or vegetable into their diets and learning more about mindfulness and mental health. The prize for earning the most points? A renovation for the facilities of a local organization.In the end, Girls Inc. of Worcester was the big winner.But employees who participated reaped benefits too. ""I signed on to be a co-leader of the Girls Inc. team because this is typically something I don't do-I'm a ‘background' type of person, but wanted to challenge myself,"" says Manuela Capodanno, grant coordinator, medical affairs, Urology and Pelvic Health. Ultimately, she says, her risk was worth the reward: a new outdoor multi-purpose area to promote wellness and STEM and arts education programs.Project NiramayahWhile all of India was dramatically affected by the COVID pandemic, rural India fared particularly poorly, due to a lack of medical infrastructure and facilities there. That's why the non-profit group SEWA International launched Project Niramayah-a healthcare initiative, supported by partners including Boston Scientific, that aimed to help spread awareness of COVID prevention, detection and treatment in four states across the country: Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.Story continuesUltimately, SEWA's operation partners and volunteers were able to distribute COVID care kits that included prevention equipment and a guide on detecting COVID early, as well as other basic amenities, to 3000 villages.""We at Boston Scientific are privileged to partner with Project Niramayah in India, where we got an opportunity to contribute to a noble cause and serve the community,"" says Manoj Madhavan, managing director, Boston Scientific in India. ""We hope to continue our association and stand with SEWA International in their mission to serve humanity in need.""Herradura Beach RenovationIt's a popular and beautiful destination in Costa Rica-but Herradura Beach is not a particularly accessible one for residents and tourists who have reduced mobility.Boston Scientific employees in Costa Rica who are part of the Leadership, Education and Allies for Disabilities (LEAD) employee resource group decided to work together with the country's Adapted Surf National team to make the beach more inclusive.More than 160 volunteers collected waste, painted the public spaces and planted more than 50 trees as part of the beach renovation. Boston Scientific also donated funds for the purchase of two amphibian chairs (which enable people with reduced mobility to enter the water) and accessible ramps (which were constructed mostly from recycled plastic collected at the Heredia and Coyol company sites in Costa Rica).""We knew that Herradura Beach would be transformed through our actions; however, our participation in this activity also transformed our employees and ignited our passion to continue advancing possibilities in our communities,"" says LEAD leader Gloria León.Baking for a CauseAs part of the Week of Caring that Boston Scientific celebrates each June, employees in Singapore spent 20 hours volunteering in support of seven local organizations.One of those organizations was the Red Cross Home, which is a residence for more than 100 adults and children with multiple disabilities who can't care for themselves. Boston Scientific employees sought to bring them some joy and comfort by taking an afternoon to bake them cookies, madeleines and banana bread and write accompanying notes of support.Other Week of Caring initiatives in Singapore included preparing food at the Willing Hearts Food Kitchen, which provides meals for people in need and refurbishing IT equipment for groups including Beyond Social Services, Pertapis Children's Home and Ramakrishna Mission Boys' Home.""With COVID restrictions relaxed this year, making time to celebrate our global Week of Caring was featured high on the list for all of us in Singapore,"" says Cynthia Chia, office manager, APAC. ""We got our families involved and were happy to actively give back to the communities around us in person.""Learn more about how Boston Scientific empowers its employees to feel valued, and create value, every day.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/Home.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733127/How-Boston-Scientific-Celebrates-the-Spirit-of-Giving-All-Year-Round]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Norfolk SouthernOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Director, James Squires, for US$5.2m worth of shares, at about US$246 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$247). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 18% of James Squires's stake.Insiders in Norfolk Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Norfolk Southern Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Norfolk Southern. In total, Director James Squires dumped US$5.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Norfolk Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Norfolk Southern insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$58m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Norfolk Southern Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Norfolk Southern is growing earnings. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We'd practice some caution before buying! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Norfolk Southern has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.But note: Norfolk Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.45%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.05%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 5.88%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had gained 1.87% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 1.66% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.68% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.45 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $9.95 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago period.KO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.48 per share and revenue of $42.8 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.9% and +10.72%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Coca-Cola is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Coca-Cola's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.72. This valuation marks a no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.72.Story continuesInvestors should also note that KO has a PEG ratio of 4.13 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Beverages - Soft drinks stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 3.26 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 47, putting it in the top 19% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category.

Over the last 12 months, CCEP's PEG has been as high as 1.59 and as low as 0.74, with a median of 1.28.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is likely being undervalued right now.

ATO, NewJersey Resources Corp. NJR and Northwest Natural Holding Co. NWN.Industry: Natural Gas - DistributionLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2030901/4-gas-distribution-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe production of natural gas in the United States is likely to increase year over year in 2023 per the latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") and continue driving stocks in the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry. The distribution companies offer services to transport natural gas from the region of production to millions of consumers across the United States.Sempra Energy, with its widespread natural gas infrastructure and systematic investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2022-2023 time period. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in key production regions should drive the performance of Atmos Energy Corp., NewJersey Resources Corp. and Northwest Natural Holding Co..About the IndustryThe shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature is steadily boosting demand for natural gas from all customer groups. Natural Gas distribution pipelines play a vital role in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines. The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 3 million miles of pipelines.Major concerns for the industry are aging infrastructure and increasing investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. Competition from other clean sources of energy can lower demand for natural gas, and consequently for pipelines. The expected contraction in U.S economic activity in fourth-quarter 2022 and first-quarter 2023 is a concern.Story continuesFactors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution IndustryAging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may result in the disruption of services. At present, natural gas distribution utilities provide services to over 80 million customers in the United States.Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. To lower the possibility of interruption in services, the Department of Energy announced $33 million in funding for 10 projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing old cast iron and bare steel pipes.  The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile.At present, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years. Despite the efforts of utilities to upgrade pipelines, aging natural gas pipelines also resulted in a few accidents in 2022.Production and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow 3.7% year over year to 98.13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2022 and 2.3% year over year to 100.38 Bcf/d in 2023. EIA also expects U.S. natural gas consumption to increase 5.38% in 2022 to 88.42 Bcf/d due to higher consumption from all customer groups, while 2023 consumption is expected to drop by 3.4% to 85.40 Bcf/d due to the expectation of milder winter temperature and lower usage from the residential and commercial customer group.EIA expects U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase 8.6% year over year to 10.6 Bcf/d in 2022. The export volume was lower than expected due to an accident in the Freeport LNG Export Terminal. With the Freeport terminal resuming operation, EIA expects LNG export volumes to increase 15.6% to 12.25 Bcf/d in 2023.Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States is driving demand for natural gas. The distribution network will continue to play a major role in transporting natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States.The demand from the rising natural gas customer volume and usage of natural gas to produce electricity will play a pivotal role in the utilities' gradual transition toward clean energy. Three new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals.Per EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. As production and demand for natural gas are increasing, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the natural gas to end-users.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.The Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry — a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector — currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #196, which places it in the bottom 21% of the 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Companies that pay dividends prioritize cash flow first. Management will allocate cash flow to shareholders, rewarding them with a high dividend yield.Finding cheap dividend stocks is critical for another reason. By the time the Federal Reserve meets for the second time in 2023, the central bank will set a Fed Funds rate of over 5%, that 5% still trails real borrowing costs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor example, mortgage rates and loans to small businesses will exceed 6%. In addition, the consumer price index, which measures inflation, is 7.1% year over year.

It is focused on its existing clients to sustain its business growth.In the mortgage sector, Scotiabank noted that its average customer has higher FICO scores. This is a scoring system that lenders use to measure credit risk.Story continuesBeyond one year, investors should forecast interest rates falling.

Ford has increased the price of the F-150 Lightning. The base price is now more than $15,000 above the original pricing.Ford wants to encourage customers to consider the higher-end Lightning. It did not raise the prices of the higher trims. The company faces higher supply costs. It needs to pass the inflation-driven cost increases to customers.Shareholders, who get paid a dividend that yields 5%, can bet that demand will not change from its target customers. As inflationary pressures recede in the coming months, the Fed will stop raising interest rates.Perceptions of an interest rate drop will drive automobile demand higher. The abrupt drop in F stock creates a rare chance for value investors to get shares at a discount.Ford positioned its product line-up to embrace the widespread adoption of EVs. This should lift long-term profitability and its share price.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comInvestors are dumping shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of fear. This is misguided. The semiconductor of PC processors has an attractive product line-up.Last year, it released Alder Lake CPUs, offering customers good prices for high performance. More recently, Intel updated the chip with Raptor Lake for even more performance gains.Intel has a clear product line-up through 2024. Emerald Rapids will handle every workload type. In 2024, it will release Sierra Forest, a power-efficient product. On the data center side, Intel will end its market share loss.The company has two major products on the way. In its network business, it will gain market share. In the graphics business, Intel entered the market with a discrete card. It does not need a high-end GPU. It only needs an affordable, mainstream card that customers want.Intel is lowering its expenses. Its operating expense will fall from $22 billion to around $20 billion in 2023. As revenue stabilizes and costs fall, investors will find INTC stock attractive.LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)A LyondellBasell production plant in Wesseling, Germany is seen at dusk.Source: Flagmania / Shutterstock.comLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a specialty chemicals firm. Its acquisitions and its joint venture in China are positive catalysts for growth.LyondellBasell will improve the competitiveness of its assets in Europe.

In the year-to-date period, energy costs in Europe are $1.8 billion higher compared to 2020.The increasing risks of a recession in 2023 will require the company to increase its revenue in countries on the rebound. For example, China normally imports 40% of its needs in polyethylene. Once the country manages through the Covid pandemic, expect LyondellBasell to report better sales in China.Medifast (MED)A person receives a delivery of groceries in a paper bag from other person.Source: Hananeko_Studio / Shutterstock.comMedifast (NYSE:MED) is a nutrition and weight loss company.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.45% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.05%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 5.88%.Coming into today, shares of the industrial conglomerate had lost 5.57% in the past month. In that same time, the Conglomerates sector lost 1.29%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.68%.General Electric will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, General Electric is projected to report earnings of $1.12 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 21.74%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $21.88 billion, up 7.79% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.54 per share and revenue of $75.86 billion. These totals would mark changes of +19.81% and +2.33%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. General Electric is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, General Electric is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 32.7. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.73, so we one might conclude that General Electric is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that GE currently has a PEG ratio of 4.67. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. GE's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.75 as of yesterday's close.The Diversified Operations industry is part of the Conglomerates sector.

For more brands, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Brands That Are Great Investments Now.Cover even a basic course in finance and you are likely to come across several different ways to value a company. These range from simple ratios to complex methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis which involves projecting a firm's cash flows into the future and then discounting them back to gain a sense of its fair value. Another popular, and easy, method is market capitalization, which simply multiplies the firm's outstanding shares with its share price.However, capturing the non-intrinsic value of a company - one that is determined by customer goodwill, corporate practices, and brand strength - is more difficult simply due to the qualitative nature of these factors. Calculating this value becomes crucial at the time of mergers or acquisitions, as the acquiring firm often ends up paying a premium for the target if the latter is a strong brand. This premium is called synergy during the acquisition phase, and its value is reflected as goodwill on the balance sheet of the acquiring entity. The balance sheet adjustment has to be made because the price paid for a firm is often higher than the value of its assets, and an adjustment is necessary to balance the 'balance' sheet.Today's piece will look at some of the most valuable brands in the world, and determine if they are also popular with hedge funds.

Despite its solid prospects, the industry has been grappling with escalating costs resulting from continued investments to bolster digital capabilities. Shortage of nurses and inflationary pressure continue to hamper the efficacies of HMO industry players. In spite of the prevailing challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, Cigna Corporation CI, Humana Inc. HUM and Centene Corporation CNC are better placed to navigate the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of its subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO IndustryTechnology Investments Amid a Growing Digital Era: Players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay abreast with the ongoing digital trend. These investments are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms through which the operational efficiencies of healthcare providers receive a boost. Telehealth platforms have exhibited solid demand since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as these offered healthcare services within the comfort of one’s home. There are no signs of the demand receding and therefore it seems prudent on the part of HMO players to undertake digital investments. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Story continuesNursing Shortage: A notable headwind that has been troubling the U.S. healthcare industry for quite some is an acute shortage of nurses. Health insurers collaborate with several hospitals, as a result of which health plan members of the former can avail hospital treatments at discounted rates. Thereby, health insurers have to depend on nurses and other medical personnel for providing quality managed care services at hospitals per the unique needs of their clients. In the absence of a sufficient nursing workforce, a hospital’s ability to deliver quality services might get affected, which, in turn, may indirectly impact the customer base of a health insurer. A McKinsey report, forecasting that the United States might witness a shortage of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025, further highlights the dismal scenario that awaits health insurers.Well-Performing Government Business: The health insurers devise affordable Medicare, Medicaid and Marketplace plans as part of the government business. Frequently, health plans are upgraded with attractive features to retain existing customers as well as attract new ones. Additionally, the HMO players remain on a spree to come up with advanced health plans as that might win them federal or state contracts from time to time. This, in turn, bolsters the customer base and leads to a steady rise in premiums. Increasing premiums bode well for the top line. However, amid the continued inflationary headwind that often takes a toll on the spending habits of consumers, the ability of consumers to continue paying for health plan premiums remain uncertain to some extent.An Aging U.S. Population: While an aging U.S. population might have been one of the factors contributing to the nationwide nursing scarcity issue, it has definitely been a blessing in disguise for health insurers offering Medicare plans. Meant to benefit people aged 65 or above, Medicare plans are expected to remain in solid demand on account of a growing aging population across the United States. According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, around 16.9% of the American population was aged 65 years or above in 2020 and the percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. In an effort to bolster the Medicare customer base, the industry participants even operate senior-focused centers for delivering quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical  sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #217, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can buy or retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 5.5% against the S&amp;P 500’s 20.2% decline and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 20.1%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 19.33X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.01X and the sector’s 22.45X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.48X and as low as 19.32X, with the median being at 20.2X.Forward 12-Month Price/Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research4 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye onWe are presenting four stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The healthcare provider has a solid telehealth platform in place that it has developed through continuous partnerships and significant investments. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained 6.5% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s 2022 EPS indicates a 15.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure.

It remains on track to achieve 10-13% average annual adjusted EPS growth on a long-term basis. CI’s Government business is driven by continuous product expansions, rising membership and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. Its shares have surged 47.5% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2022 EPS indicates a 13% increase, while the same for revenues suggests 3.2% growth from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. CI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 9.84%.Price &amp; Consensus: CIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana: Growing premium revenues arising from an increasing customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses continue to drive revenues of Kentucky-based Humana. The strength of the cost-effective Medicaid and Medicare health plans devised by HUM has fetched numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from Ohio, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin for the company. The CenterWell brand, together with Conviva, is part of Humana’s Primary Care Organization, which is one of the largest senior-focused primary care providers in the United States. The stock has rallied 10.3% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM’s 2022 EPS indicates a 21.4% increase from the prior-year reported number, while the same for revenues suggests growth of 11.9%.

In December 2022, reflecting one of its growth-related investments, CNC collaborated with Community Health Development (CHDI) to establish a new community center in Texas for providing primary medical care and behavioral health services across the state. Even though its shares have lost 3.2% in a year, CNC’s strong fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene’s 2022 EPS indicates an 11.1% increase from the year-earlier reading.

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-automatic-data-120109962.html,1671796869,STORY,['ADP'],"[How far off is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.39bUS$4.83bUS$5.15bUS$5.08bUS$5.37bUS$5.52bUS$5.65bUS$5.79bUS$5.92bUS$6.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.50%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$109bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$109b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$52bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$88b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$239, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Automatic Data ProcessingStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the IT industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Procter &amp; Gamble:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$19b ÷ (US$116b - US$37b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Procter &amp; Gamble compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEProcter &amp; Gamble is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 48% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, we're delighted to see that Procter &amp; Gamble has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 90% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.If you want to continue researching Procter &amp; Gamble, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

He also runs the CNBC Investing Club and is the co-founder of finance publication The Street. His net worth, as of the end of November 2022, was in excess of $150 million. Cramer is considered a leading expert on the US stock market as he has been involved in stocks for the best part of three decades and finished his hedge fund career with returns of over 24%, becoming a finance guru between 1987 and 2001. Cramer recently underlined recent comments from Jerome Powell, the chief of the central bank, and noted they had given investors the green-light to invest in stocks. Cramer reminded investors who were worried about the economy tipping into recession that a crisis was still avoidable and there were many segments of the market that could be potential winners in 2023. Some of the stocks that Cramer is bullish on heading into 2023 include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Our MethodologyThese were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Cramer made on these equities on his Mad Money show aired by news platform CNBC. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This WeekJim Cramer Stock Picks This Week10.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”9. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 76 Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) operates as a health and well-being company in the United States.  On December 20, during his Mad Money show on CNBC, Jim Cramer outlined his bullish position on the health and well-being firm, noting that the stock was a great turnaround story. On December 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Nathan Rich upgraded Humana Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) has held up well amid volatile markets given the characteristics of the Medicare Advantage market and expectations that it can return to market growth in the 2023 annual enrollment period. We are confident in Humana’s value creation plan and ability to get back to market enrollment growth in addition to an increasing contribution from its health care services businesses. Shares of Texas Instruments outperformed as the COVID lockdowns eased in China, and customers could accept the product shipments leading to an upside in expectations.”8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) researches and develops, manufactures, and sells various products in the healthcare field.

The majority of the group’s sales come from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)7. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43     Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines. On December 20, during his Mad Money show on CNBC, Jim Cramer gave a bullish thesis on the firm, noting that the stock had much more exposure to infrastructure, and also had a boost coming from the oil and gas industry.

(NYSE:CAT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large-cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large-cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”6. Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57  Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) manufactures and distributes various equipment worldwide. On December 20, Jim Cramer gave his take on the firm during his Mad Money show on CNBC, placing it among a basket of stocks that he thought would be winners in 2023 and also end 2022 as outperformers of the broader market. On December 19, investment advisory Stifel maintained a Buy rating on Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) stock and raised the price target to $477 from $475. Analyst Stanley Elliott issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is a leading shareholder in Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) with 3.9 million shares worth more than $1.3 billion.Along with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer is bullish on. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) was one of them.

The company has also demonstrated excellent execution, highlighted by capturing market share and maintaining margins despite dealing with a labor strike and elevated supply chain costs.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This Week. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy. A widow and orphan stock refers to an equity investment that pays a steady dividend and is generally considered to be low-risk, defensive, and non-volatile. These are usually large-cap, stable, and old-economy companies in non-cyclical business sectors. Dividends provide investors with a margin of safety despite the challenging environment for the capital markets, and dividend equities have outperformed non-dividend equities and bonds year-to-date.Investing in dividends, primarily those firms that increase their payouts on a year-over-year basis, can make massive contributions to long-term portfolio returns in an otherwise volatile market. Looking for the highest-yielding dividend stock is usually associated with higher risk. Investors should focus on picking up stocks which have a consistent track record of growing their dividends year after year. Nick Lentini of the Morgan Stanley Equity Strategy team said on November 9: “The investing backdrop of the past year, driven by macroeconomic conditions and combined with the rising risk of recession, have fueled outperformance for many dividend-paying stocks.”Sectors which are positioned to grow their dividends consistently include Energy, Packaged Food, Beverages and Household Products, Utilities, and Banks. Some of the best widow and orphan stocks to buy include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Our Methodology We selected the following widow and orphan stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and growing dividends over the last 30 years or more. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To BuyPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashBest Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy10. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of December 21: 4.98%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) was founded in 1901 and is based in Deerfield, Illinois. The company operates as an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retailer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and internationally. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has three segments – U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International, and U.S. Healthcare. The company paid a $0.48 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on December 12 and has 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. On December 14, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $36 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The analyst believes managed care and drug distributors' earnings visibility remains attractive, but she thinks hospitals have the most improved outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) at the end of September 2022, compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 6 million shares worth $186.5 million. In addition to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the best widow and orphan stocks to consider for a safe portfolio. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9. Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of December 21: 2.52%Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is a Texas-based company that engages in the marketing and distribution of various food products to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industries in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and internationally.

(NYSE:EMR) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 47 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 2 million shares worth $145 million. 7. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Dividend Yield as of December 21: 2.39%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational manufacturer of consumer products, operating through two segments – Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition. The company markets and sells its products under the Colgate, Darlie, Palmolive, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, EltaMD, Filorga, PCA SKIN, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, and Murphy brands, among others.

Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.55 million shares worth $811.3 million. Here is what Third Point specifically said about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)6. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Dividend Yield as of December 21: 1.89%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an Illinois-based company that discovers, develops, and manufactures healthcare products worldwide. It operates in four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On December 9, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, an 8.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.47. The dividend is payable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 13. 2022 marks the company's 51st consecutive year of dividend growth.On December 12, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch raised the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $125 from $114 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Looking into 2023, ""many headwinds remain"" for the North America medical supplies and technology group, but these should ease in the second half of next year, alleviating operating margin pressures, the analyst wrote in a research noteAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 62 hedge funds were long Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a premier widow and orphan stock to buy. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Travel Stocks To Buy13 Best New Tech Stocks To Buy12 Best Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $78.25, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Stericycle’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Stericycle?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Stericycle's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SRCL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SRCL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SRCL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Stericycle at this point in time.

What We Think,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflacs-afl-dividend-hikes-sustainable-144302115.html,1671720182,STORY,"['AFL', 'MTG']","[Aflac Incorporated AFL hiked its dividend for the first quarter of 2023 to 42 cents per share from the previous level of 40 cents, maintaining its dividend growth history. Along with the update on Nov 8, the company also announced an addition of $100 million in its share buyback program.Over the last five years, the company increased dividends six times and has an annualized dividend growth of 10.8%. The dividend yield, based on the latest payout and Dec 21 closing market price of $71.46, is approximately 2.4%, which is safe and a bit higher than the industry average of 2.2%.Now the question arises if the hike is sustainable and whether the momentum will be retained.The company’s earnings cover the dividends. Even though the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings suggests an 11.6% decline from the year-ago period to $5.25 per share, Aflac will still cover annual dividend payments of $1.60 per share. For next year, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $5.37 per share, which will cover the annual dividend payments of $1.68 per share.So, the company is expected to earn enough to not only cover its dividend payments but also grow the business in the future. The latest hike is reflective of its confidence in the stability of the base business, long-term prospects and solid financial position.Aflac exited the third quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4,710 million and adjusted debt of $6,762 million. Adjusted debt to adjusted capitalization came in at 22.4%, which improved 160 basis points year over year. While it had no debt maturities in less than a year, total debt maturities worth only $1,732 million were expected within the next five years.Even though free cash flows declined 26.4% in the trailing 12-month period, robust business recovery is expected to boost the metric going ahead. Courtesy of growth investments and productivity gains, Aflac’s U.S. segment continues to perform well.Factors like product innovations and new introductions, the build-out of virtual sales channels, an increase in face-to-face interactions, and the recruitment of agents are likely to drive the segment’s sales going forward. Also, productivity improvements at Japan Post Group are expected to support sales in the Japan business.Story continuesConsidering the factors stated above, it is quite likely that Aflac will continue its dividend growth momentum in a safe and sustainable manner. Even with a hiccup in earnings in the short-term, long-term prospects remain lucrative.Price PerformanceShares of Aflac have jumped 25% in the past year compared with the 17.6% increase of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAflac currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.45%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.05%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 5.88%.Coming into today, shares of the food and beverage company had lost 1.39% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector gained 1.66%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.68%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PepsiCo as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 9, 2023. In that report, analysts expect PepsiCo to post earnings of $1.64 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 7.19%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $26.71 billion, up 5.78% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.76 per share and revenue of $85.1 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.99% and +7.08%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.72, so we one might conclude that PepsiCo is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that PEP has a PEG ratio of 3.51 right now.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Companies that Sponsor H1B Visas. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and among the most popular nations in the world. It is home to one of the best education systems in the world and also has pioneering companies that lead - and in some cases have created - their own industries. Consequently, the U.S. is a dream for millions of students and workers.In order to work in the U.S., one visa that a nonimmigrant has to obtain is an H1-B visa. This is a company-sponsored ticket stamped on the passport and is tightly controlled by Homeland Security and the State Department. The U.S. economy is fueled by these visas, as the H1-B workers often work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas where U.S. citizen workers are often in a shortage. Data backs up this conclusion, as H-1B workers are 8.4% of the U.S. population. They are not classified US citizens, but the percentage figure is derived by dividing the 28 million foreign workers by the 334 million U.S. population.The largest sponsors of foreign workers are Indian and U.S. technology firms. Most H1-B workers have obtained a U.S. degree, and a STEM designated degree also allows them to search and work for years before their student visa expires. The biggest H1-B visa sponsors are Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NSE:TCS.NS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Photo by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) which includes new applications, new approvals, rolling approvals, and rolling denials.
