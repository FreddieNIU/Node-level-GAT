We'll use ROE to examine Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verisk Analytics is:52% = US$1.0b ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.52 in profit.Does Verisk Analytics Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Verisk Analytics has a higher ROE than the average (16%) in the Professional Services industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for Verisk Analytics.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Verisk Analytics' Debt And Its 52% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Verisk Analytics, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.70. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

1,8491252c-d806-37a5-8f1e-cb7703bc1322,SCHW,2023-02-13,Is Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund (LGILX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-select-large-cap-growth-120012949.html,1676289612,STORY,['SCHW'],"[If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds, you might want to consider passing on by Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund (LGILX) as a possibility. LGILX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerLaudus is based in Boston, MA, and is the manager of LGILX. The Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund made its debut in July of 2009 and LGILX has managed to accumulate roughly $1.90 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. LGILX has a 5-year annualized total return of 6.9% and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 1.06%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of LGILX over the past three years is 24.73% compared to the category average of 23.87%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 21.84% compared to the category average of 21.12%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. LGILX has a 5-year beta of 1.09, which means it is likely to be more volatile than the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. LGILX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -2.5, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsInvestigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.This fund is currently holding about 90.06% stock in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $327.46 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyRetail TradeTurnover is 50%, which means, on average, the fund makes fewer trades than the average comparable fund.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, LGILX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% compared to the category average of 0.99%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, LGILX is actually cheaper than its peers.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Select Large Cap Growth Fund ( LGILX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on LGILXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

Client organic asset growth also remained strong with $115 billion of net new assets, a 7% growth rate.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and FCF in the years to come. Moreover, although the historically low level of interest rates has been a drag on profitability in recent years, the combination of steadily rising short-term rates (which should benefit net interest income), plus acquisition synergies from the AMTD deal, gives us confidence that SCHW is poised to generate continued double-digit earnings growth for the foreseeable future.”Story continuesCharles Schwab, bank, financePhoto by Brendan Church on UnsplashThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds list.

3,fc5c3618-d832-336a-a971-02ba04fbc080,TXN,2023-02-13,Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 86% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-incorporated-nasdaq-txn-110016995.html,1676286016,STORY,['TXN'],"[If you want to know who really controls Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Texas Instruments. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Texas Instruments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Texas Instruments' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Texas Instruments. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$196m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Texas Instruments. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Texas Instruments is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those don't sit too well with us...If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

4,55537d02-89ed-3e7b-a607-49997e1c7b9b,WDC,2023-02-13,‘Cyclical bottom is approaching’: Top analyst explains why you should ‘buy’ these 3 chip stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cyclical-bottom-approaching-top-analyst-235230209.html,1676245950,STORY,"['MU', 'WDC', 'STX']","[Booms and busts are familiar to any student of economics – they form the underlying patterns of long-term performance, for whole economies and for individual sectors. A recent report on the semiconductor chip industry helps to show the pattern – and sheds some light on where and how investors can position themselves now for maximum advantage.To begin with, the report, based on global chip sales data, places the start of the current cycle in early 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic crisis. While a hard blow to economies generally, this period also saw the start of a boom in chip sales; demand increased as office workers moved to remote connections, and as consumers upgraded home computer systems to meet the burden of increased work-from-home, online school, and e-commerce shopping. A surge in smartphone and tablet purchases also helped fuel demand for chips. That momentum held through the first half of 2022.We’re in the bust phase now, and have been for at least half a year. Sales numbers reached record high levels in the first half of last year, but tumbled in the second half. The question now is, have we hit bottom, or are nearing the bottom, in this cycle?5-star analyst Vijay Rakesh, of Mizuho Securities, says that we are approaching a bottom, and he predicts a turn for the better in the near future.“We see improving structural trends driving an accelerated path to supply/demand balance for Memory,"" Rakesh noted. ""Near-term headwinds remain with high inventories and 1Q23E PCs/ Handsets/Servers expected down 20%/20%/10% q/q, and Memory pricing down 10% YTD; however, we are close to a cyclical bottom. 1Q23 could see the peak in inventories and a trough in revenue, with fundamentals set to recover in 2H23E/2024E.”To prepare for that coming upturn, Rakesh has upgraded three chip stocks from Neutral to Buy. Using TipRanks’ database, we wanted to see if other Wall Street analysts agree with Rakesh's calls. Here’s what we found out.Story continuesMicron Technology, Inc. (MU)The first chip giant on our radar is Micron Technology, a $65 billion player in the memory chip segment. Micron is well known for its data storage products, including DRAM, flash storage, and USB drive semiconductor chip lines. The company’s 1-beta DRAM chip is most advanced currently on the market, and the firm has recently announced upgrades to its data server memory portfolio line-up.While Micron has been active in keeping its chip lines at the forefront technology, the company has seen its sales decline in recent months. In the most recent reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal year 2023 – the quarter ending on December 1, 2022 – Micron showed a top line of $4.09 billion. This was down sharply from the $6.64 billion reported in 4Q22, and down from the $7.69 billion reported in 1Q22. The company’s earnings, which had been running positive despite the sales decline, turned to a negative 4-cents per share in 1Q23.Unsurprisingly, the company’s share price has also been declining over the past year. Over the last 12 months, MU stock has fallen 33%, more than double the 15% drop in the NASDAQ over the same period.Checking in with Mizuho’s Rakesh, however, we find that the analyst is upbeat for the long term. As noted, he has upgraded his stance on MU from Neutral to Buy, and backing that, Rakesh writes: “While we could continue to see some near-term weakness with inventory digestion at PC/smartphone/data center, we believe capex cuts, supply a multi-year low, and 2H rebound along with improving investor sentiment position MU well as we see a FebQ/MayQ trough.”Along with the Buy rating, Rakesh also gives MU stock a $72 price target, implying ~20% upside for the coming year. (To watch Rakesh’s track record, click here)Leading tech firms like Micron will always pick up attention from Wall Street, and this company has 23 recent analyst reviews on record. These include 16 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See Micron stock forecast)Western Digital (WDC)Next up is Western Digital, a major player in the chip industry. Western, based in San Jose, California, is another specialist in computer memory – but its focus is on hard disk drives and other primary data storage, as well as SSDs and flash drives. Western has built a solid position in the data center and cloud storage niches, and its product lines feature well-known brand names including WD and SanDisk.Western Digital shows the same pattern in revenue and earnings that we saw above in Micron: a top line decline starting in the latter half of calendar year 2022, accompanied by a dropoff at the bottom line turning to negative earnings. The most recent reported quarter, Q2 of fiscal year 2023 (the quarter corresponding to calendar 4Q22), Western reported $3.11 billion in total revenue. While this was at the high end of the previously published guidance, it was still down almost 17% from the previous quarter, and was down 35% year-over-year.On the bottom line, Western reported a fiscal Q2 earnings loss of 42 cents per share, by non-GAAP measures. In GAAP terms, the quarterly EPS loss was $1.40. These figures were down from profits in the previous quarter, of 8 cents by GAAP measures and 20 cents by non-GAAP.Despite the losses in earnings/revenue, Western Digital still holds a strong position in its niche – and is aiming to improve its standing. The company has recently been sounding out talks with Japanese chip maker Kioxia on a potential merger. While this remains at the rumor stage (neither company has confirmed anything), such a move would create a combined entity with control over one-third of the market for NAND flash chips.In the eyes of Mizuho’s Rakesh, this gives support to the recently upgraded Buy rating on WDC stock. Rakesh writes: “We believe WDC is positioned for upside in HDD [hard disk drive], and undervalued given a potential 2H23/24E NAND rebound and a possible strategic NAND spin with Elliot activism and possible Kioxia merger talks... While near-term we see some challenges in 1H23E with inventory corrections and softer demand, we see an improving HDD/NAND market as suppliers focus on lowering capex and supply growth to help normalize inventories, setting up for a better 2H23E/2024E recovery.”Based on all of the above factors, Rakesh gives WDC shares a $50 price target to back his Buy rating. That figure implies ~16% upside from current levels.Overall, there have been 14 analysts sounding off lately on WDC, and their reviews include 7 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See WDC stock forecast)Seagate Technology (STX)The last chip stock we’re looking at is Seagate Technology, long a leader in hard disk drive (HDD) tech. Seagate developed the first 5.25-inch hard drives back in the 80s, and over the years has followed a successful course of growth through acquisition. Today, Seagate is a $14 billion player with a line of products in three areas: Cloud &amp; Data Center; Specialized Drives; and Personal Storage.Following the same pattern like Micron and Western Digital, Seagate has seen its top and bottom lines fall off over the past several months. It’s last quarterly report was for fiscal 2Q23 (the quarter ending this past December 30), and showed revenues of $1.89 billion. This was down 7% sequentially – and 39% year-over-year. Earnings have fallen to a just 16 cents per share by non-GAAP measures; the GAAP EPS came in at a loss of 16 cents per share. Looking forward, however, analysts are forecasting a fiscal 3Q non-GAAP EPS increase to 26 cents.Against this backdrop, Mizuho’s Rakesh got one thing to say: don't throw the towel just yet. The analyst believes this company has sound prospects for getting out of the doldrums sooner rather than later.“STX has managed significant ~25% q/q inventory reduction with 2H demand positioned better, and a margin accretive HAMR roadmap into 2024E for 30TB+ mass capacity drives... We see HDD inventories normalizing post-1Q23E with potential for a return growth earlier than as inventories are flushed out at key enterprise customers, setting STX up for a strong 2HC23E,” Rakesh opined.This is another chip stock that Rakesh has upgraded to Buy, and his price target here, $82, indicates potential for a 15% upside over the course of this year.All in, all, this stock shows an almost-even split among the Street’s analysts; of the 22 recent reviews on file, there are 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and a single Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

NTR is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings after the closing bell on Feb 15.The company surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters while missing it twice, the average surprise being a negative 6.3%. It posted a negative earnings surprise of 36% in the last reported quarter.NTR is expected to have benefited from strong demand across its segments. However, higher natural gas prices are expected to have posed a headwind in the fourth quarter.The stock has gained 9.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 8.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $7,549 million, which indicates a rise of 3.9% from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the Potash segment currently stands at $1,630 million, implying a year-over-year jump of 14.8%. The consensus Estimate for its Phosphate segment is currently pegged at $636 million, which indicates a rise of 7.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTR’s Nitrogen segment currently stands at $2,055 million, suggesting an increase of 24.6%.Some Factors to WatchNTR is likely to have benefited from solid demand and higher prices for fertilizers in the fourth quarter, backed by the strength in the global agricultural market. The company is expected to have gained from strong potash sales volume backed by pent-up demand and actions to boost production. Strong grower economics are also expected to have increased sales of Phosphate and Potash in North America.    Potash prices are likely to have been supported by tight supply in the December quarter. Tight inventory, along with healthy demand, is also expected to have driven phosphate prices. Lower global supply availability stemming from reduced operating rates, strong demand and a spike in energy prices are likely to have aided nitrogen prices in the quarter to be reported.However, natural gas curtailments in Trinidad are expected to have adversely impacted the company’s nitrogen business, affecting volumes. Higher natural gas costs are also likely to have led to a rise in the company’s cost of goods sold per ton for nitrogen. Higher gas costs might have affected the company’s nitrogen margins in the fourth quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nutrien this season.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and our outlook for 2023. 2022 was a terrific year for Equity Residential. We finished the year, as we expected, producing same-store revenue growth of 10.6%. We continued to see good demand during the fourth quarter, but certainly saw a return of seasonality to the business. Our strong 2022 same-store revenue growth combined with modest expense growth of 3.6% resulted in same-store net operating income growth for the full year of 14.1%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 17.7% increase in year-over-year normalized FFO. I want to take a moment, thank all my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work and dedication in delivering these terrific results.Story continuesIn a moment, Michael Manelis will take you through our 2022 highlights and how we expect 2023 to shape up on the revenue side; and Bob Garechana will comment on bad debt and review our 2022 expense results and 2023 expense expectations, as well as recent balance sheet activities and then we will take your questions. We have provided guidance for same-store revenue growth at a midpoint of 5.25%, which would make 2023 another good year for Equity Residential and produce same-store revenue growth well above our long-term average. We do admit to finding 2023 harder to predict than usual. On the positive side, we go into the year, expecting a benefit from embedded growth of about 4.2% from leases written in 2022 and we also carry into the year and above average loss to lease, both of which will contribute to positive momentum for us, particularly in the first half of 2023.We also feel good about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. There still appears to be plentiful employment opportunities for the highly skilled workers that formed the bulk of our residents as evidenced by last week's blowout January employment and job openings reports. We saw big increases in employment in the professional and business services category, a smaller gain in financial activities and only a modest decline in information services, all big employment categories for our residents. So far the announced layoffs at tech and some financial firms while certainly creating a negative environment have not manifested themselves much in the government's reported numbers, or thus far in our internal numbers.We've only seen a handful of residents terminating leases early due to job loss. Possibly the impact is delayed due to severance and other factors. But it is at least equally possible that the workers in these categories are being quickly reabsorbed into the job market. Our renter demographic has proven resilient in the past, and we expect them to continue to be highly employable. As to renter incomes, according to the Atlanta Fed wage tracker, college graduates wages accelerated in the fourth quarter, outpacing wage gains achieved by hourly workers despite the higher base. Looking at competition from home ownership and new apartment supply in 2023, we also generally see a favorable picture. Homeownership costs and down-payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making our product to better value.According to the National Association of Realtors, for their affordability index to return to pre-COVID levels, one of three things will need to occur: The 30-year mortgage rate will need to decline to 2.6%; home prices to fall by 1/3, our family incomes to increase by 50%. This is all very consistent with our internal data, which shows the percentage of residents leaving us to purchase a home fell to 9.4% in the fourth quarter from 15.8% a year ago. On the apartment supply side, we expect 2023 national new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the direct level of competition that we will face given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. The Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets, in which we are increasingly investing and Denver, will see higher relative supply numbers in our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that's coupled with a job slowdown.In terms of supply in our coastal established markets, where we still have 95% of our properties. Our internal research indicates that new apartments delivered near to our properties create significantly more short-term pressure on our results. As we look at 2023's expected deliveries through that lens, new supply within close proximity to our properties in our coastal established markets is actually forecasted to be below pre-pandemic levels with only the Washington D.C. and Orange County market screening as delivering above average supply close to our properties relative to these pre-pandemic supply averages. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across the country sets us up for good long-term demand. We do, however, fully acknowledge that despite what was good GDP growth in the fourth quarter and full year and continuing strong employment reports, the Federal Reserve's rate actions are likely to pressure job growth and economic growth as 2023 progresses.We took this into account in our guidance by assuming a lower rate of rental rate growth during 2023 than usual and a decline in occupancy. But whether there is or isn't a technical recession is of considerably less importance to us than whether job growth substantially declines and if so when. A decline at the beginning of our spring leasing season will be considerably more impactful than a slowdown later in the year. We also now expect that the elevated post-pandemic level of bad debt in some of our California markets does improve in 23 but at a slower rate than we previously hoped, as poor public policies encouraging delinquency continue. Bob will discuss all this in a moment. In sum, we make no prediction about a recession but have assumed some impact to our 2023 results from a job slowdown and flawed government policy and evictions, while continuing to see sources of strength in our business in the form of modest forward competition from home purchases and new apartment supply, the high employment ability of our residents even if the job market deteriorates from its current lofty levels, and the positive forward momentum from our strong 2022 results.On the transaction front, there was not much activity in 2022 for us. We only purchased one deal and we sold three others, two in New York City and one in Washington D.C. We did start a handful of new developments. These were mostly in our Toll joint venture structure. As we head into 2023, the transaction markets remain unsettled, but we see higher than usual supply in the Sunbelt and Denver markets in which we wish to expand as hopefully creating buying opportunities for us later in the year. For now, our guidance does not assume any acquisition or disposition activity, but remain committed to our strategy of shifting capital out of California, New York and Washington D.C., and into our expansion markets of Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta, as well as the suburbs and markets like Seattle and Boston, assuming appropriate opportunities present themselves.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.Michael Manelis: Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. This morning, I will review key takeaways from our fourth quarter 2022 performance, expectations for 2023 and provide some color on the markets before I turn it over to Bob to walk through our financial guidance. 2022 same-store revenue growth of 10.6% was the best in EQR's history of nearly 30 years as a public company. Reported turnover for both the full year and the fourth quarter was the lowest in the Company's history, reflecting great demand that produced high occupancy and significant pricing power. In most of our markets, we had a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier than usual in the year. Rents peaked in August, which is typical and then started to seasonally moderate, which is also typical.The seasonal moderation was a little more pronounced than we originally expected and likely due to a combination of rents reaching such a high peak, along with less pricing power than expected as we ended the year. Given current uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, this moderation isn't surprising, though the January employment report that Mark just mentioned was very encouraging. Sitting here today, we have good occupancy with solid demand across our markets. Our dashboards and current leasing momentum continue to signal a normal spring. Let me take a minute and walk through the building blocks of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6% revenue growth. This is an updated look to what we provided in our third quarter management presentation.House, Room, InteriorPhoto by Sidekix Media on UnsplashSo first, we start with an embedded growth of 4.2% for 2023. This is slightly below the midpoint of the range we talked about in the third quarter of 4% to 5%, but mostly consistent with expectations and takes into account the additional concessions used in the fourth quarter. Next, we expect strong occupancy for 2023 at 96.2% which includes a continuation of low resident turnover but is 20 basis points lower than that of 2022. Finally, we're assuming blended rates in 2023 will average approximately 4% for the full year. This assumption incorporates capturing our 1.5% loss to lease along with approximately 2.5% intraperiod growth in rates. This intraperiod growth assumes a positive impact from less overall pressure from competitive new supply and acknowledges some potential headwinds for a softening economy.For your reference, in a normal non-recessionary year, we would expect intraperiod growth to be about 3% to 3.5% with us capturing about half of that gain in same-store revenue. The first half of 2023 will benefit from the momentum we had last year, while the back half of the year faces tougher comps and could feel the impact of the economy, as the year progresses. The contribution of this blended rate growth to revenue will be approximately half, as we capture it over the 2023 leasing season. Add all of that up and the implication is revenue growth over 6%, which would be exceptional after a remarkable 2022. The midpoint of our guidance range however is 5.25%, which is lower because we do not expect bad debt net to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and it continues to work against us this year, due to a lack of expected government rental assistance and the extension of the eviction moratoriums in both LA and Alameda counties.Bob will go into more detail on bad debt net, including our assumption in his prepared remarks. The outlook I just described is based on a belief that, while the economy may be slowing, our business continues to demonstrate a number of favorable drivers and resiliency. As we have often said in the past, we focus on our dashboards while also acknowledging the headlines. While keeping in mind that this is very early in the year, when we look at our dashboards today, the portfolio is demonstrating sequential improvement in both pricing trends and application volume, as we would expect, which by all indications is a typical pre-pandemic setup for the spring leasing season. New York and Boston will be two of our top performers in 2023, after delivering strong results in 2022.In San Francisco and Seattle, we are seeing good demand and sequential improvement in pricing with slight reductions in both the quantity and value of concessions being offered since the beginning of the year. Even with this modest improvement, the overall level of concessions are still elevated, resulting in weaker-than-anticipated pricing power. San Francisco and Seattle have been slower to recover than the other markets, but both posted really good revenue growth in 2022. Both cities have been balancing a combination of quality of life issues in their downtown, which are getting better and a delayed return to the office from large tech employers. In addition, there have been some layoff announcements from companies based in these two cities.These layoffs are a direct result of excessive hiring during the pandemic. This excess was spread across multiple markets and countries, not just Seattle and San Francisco. The remote nature of work in tech during the pandemic along with these hiring sprees, likely means that the layoffs are more geographically dispersed than in prior periods. Both of these cities remain hubs of the tech industry and share an entrepreneurial spirit that will continue to incubate the next big idea, be it AI or other innovations we find changing our lives a decade from now. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes that these markets continue to improve modestly as we get into the spring leasing season but overall weakness persists, which is why our intraperiod growth assumptions for the company overall are somewhat lower than the typical 3% to 3.5% range.If San Francisco and Seattle get some traction this year, that could have a significant positive impact on our same-store revenue growth as could a more rapid improvement in bad debt net, leading us to the higher end of our range. Reaching the bottom end of our range would require either rate growth to slow much earlier in the year than expected or occupancy to dip to the mid-95% range for a sustained period of time. And lastly, before I turn it over to Bob to discuss our guidance, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation. On the revenue side, we will continue to focus on other income items like Wi-Fi, parking and amenity rate optimization. We will also leverage data and analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margin.We have been a sector leader in limiting same store expense growth, and this is attributable to our team's willingness to embrace innovation and initiatives focused on centralized activities. We are driven to get the most out of the portfolio and continue to have great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions. In 2023, we will complete the centralization of onsite activities such as application processing, and our move-out and collection process. On the service side, we will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to share our resources across multiple properties. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results.With that I will turn the call over to Bob.Bob Garechana: Thanks, Michael. Let me start with bad debt, which should round out our thought process on same-store revenue guidance, followed up with a little commentary on same-store expenses, normalized FFO and the balance sheet. As Michael mentioned, the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance assumes a 90 basis-point reduction in revenue growth due to the impact of bad debt. As we mentioned during last quarter's call, the biggest driver of this drag is the lack of rental relief payments in 2023 relative to 2022. Specifically, we received a little over $32 million in rent relief in 2022 that isn't in the numbers in 2023. And while we ended last year with more residents paying their rent than when we started the year, a trend that we would expect to continue, our forecast doesn't assume this will be significant enough to offset this lack of rental assistance.Unfortunately, recent delays in lifting eviction moratoriums and slow processing within the courts led us to this more cautious forecast that reflects a more modest improvement coming later in the year than we had initially hoped for. We're hopeful that this caution might be unwarranted, in which case we could achieve the top end of our guidance range. But for now, we still expect delinquency to return to pre-pandemic levels, but more likely in 2024 than in 2023. Turning to expenses, I'm proud to report that in 2022, we once again continued to execute on our strategy of using technology and centralization to reduce exposure to labor pressures. Same-store payroll expense growth was negative for the second year in a row, and even when combining payroll with repairs and maintenance, a line item with significant labor exposure and product inflation, growth was below 3% for the second year in a row again.Combine that with low real estate taxes and we were able to deliver industry low expense growth. For 2023, the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance is 4.5%. This forecasted growth rate is about 100 basis points higher than what I just described for 2022 but well below both inflation and our revenue guidance, meaning we expect 2023 to be another year of operating margin expansion for the Company. Of the four major categories of expenses, repairs and maintenance and utilities should grow at a pace slower than 2022, while real estate taxes and payroll should be faster. These latter two categories face challenging comparable periods given 2022's remarkable performance in addition to the following drivers: For real estate taxes, we expect municipalities will recognize the great strong income performance for multifamily in 2022 and as a result take a more aggressive approach to assess values and rates.Total tax growth should be around 4%, up from 1% in 2022 with California continuing to benefit from Prop 13 at the low end of growth and expansion markets like Colorado, Texas and Georgia towards the higher end. These expansion markets are a small part of our same-store portfolio and the expected growth is consistent with what we underwrote on acquisition. For payroll, we expect 2023 growth to be around 3.5%, up from the decline of 2% that I just mentioned in 2022 and still well below typical wage inflation. We believe we can achieve this target through our continued discipline around staffing and optimization of our workflow. Turning to normalized FFO, page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth.Our midpoint of $3.75 per share includes a $0.01 of forecasted casualty losses from the California rainstorms that we mentioned in the release, and results in over 6% year-over-year NFFO growth, a very solid year for the Company. Finally, some comments on our planned financing activity for 2023 and the balance sheet. We mentioned in the past that we have an $800 million secured debt pool coming due, most of which needs to be refinanced in the secured market later this year. The current rate on the pool is 4.21% and the maturity is in November. The pool is very financeable, given it is roughly 50% levered and covers debt service nearly 2 times. We have favorably hedged more than half the treasury risk on the financing and would expect to be able to refinance later in the year at a 5% rate or better, which is also incorporated in our guidance.After that, the Company has no maturities to speak of until June of 2025. We have low floating rate exposure, the lowest leverage in our history, significant debt capacity and ample liquidity supported by our recently recast revolver that will support our future capital allocation activities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks.Despite a population of just 3.7 million people, if all U.S. states were countries, Connecticut would be the 67th largest country in the world, bigger than Finland, Czech Republic, Portugal and New Zealand, with a 2021 GDP of nearly $300 billion.Connecticut has been a manufacturing state since the colonization era, with its factories providing stiff competition to those in England. Through the decades, the state has given the world many new inventions including steamboats, lollipops, corkscrews and vulcanized rubber among others. This is why you will also see manufacturing companies among the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. Meanwhile, insurance companies are also a huge contributor to the state's economy with Connecticut being known as an insurance state for close to 200 years now. Agriculture may not have the same influence it did in previous centuries, but it is also still an important contributor to the economy of the state.25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocksSean Pavone/Shutterstock.comEven though Connecticut had the highest per capita personal income of any state in 2013, it also had the second-largest disparity in income between the top 1% and the bottom 99%, which showed a high level of inequality and standard of living for people in the state. Currently, Connecticut's unemployment rate is 4.2%, with only 11 states recording worse unemployment rates. This is still a significant improvement from November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.2% while the pre-pandemic unemployment rate was 3.4% in February 2020. Even though the unemployment rate is relatively high, the state has seen ten consecutive months of job growths but still trails the national average.Like most states in the U.S., Connecticut provides significant support to businesses in the state to encourage more companies to incorporate or initiate in the state and possibly even join the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. These incentives include providing grant-in-arrears equal to the value of 25% of withholding taxes from net new employees for eligible companies which have at least 25 employees. Specific eligible employers can receive a grant of up to 50% and these grants are available for up to 9 years. The state also operates tax credit programs which provide nonrefundable corporate income tax credits to eligible companies who invest at least $5 million in facilities in eligible areas. Meanwhile, several tax exemptions can also be availed based on specific situations including sales and use tax exemption, real and personal property tax exemption, and data center tax exemptions. In addition, businesses located in an enterprise zone could be eligible for ""an abatement on real and business personal property taxes of up to 80% for 5 years and a 10-year, 25% tax credit on the portion of the Connecticut corporation business tax that is directly attributable to the company relocation, expansion or renovation project. The credit may increase to 50% based on the number of new jobs created.""Story continuesThe 20 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks have combined revenues of around $420 billion and a market cap of around $550 billion. To determine these companies, we first extracted the biggest Connecticut companies by revenue from Fortune 500 and confirmed their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. Where a company wasn't listed, we used its ranking based on revenue alone. For the rest, we assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap.

""In this regard, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will help restore market relations.""Story continuesOil futures jumped over 2% after the news broke — but these gains have been partly reversed. On Monday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were 0.9% lower at $79.04 a barrel while international benchmark Brent crude was 0.8% lower at $85.74 a barrel 3.08 a.m. ET.""The weakness that we are seeing in prices in early morning trading today likely reflects the market coming to the realization that these cuts are already largely priced in,"" wrote the ING strategists in their Monday note.Despite Moscow's retaliatory measures, the sanctions seem to be working: Russia's oil revenue has already crashed by nearly 50% in January 2023 from a year ago, Russia's finance ministry said on February 6.Russia's flagship Urals crude is trading was trading at a discount of $38 a barrel against Brent oil on February 8, according to S&amp;P Global Platts. This discount is more than three times that of the $11 a barrel witnessed on February 24, 2022 — the day Russia invaded Ukraine — according to the price reporting agency.The prices of Russian oil have been depressed even though the country has been redirecting seaborne exports to Asia — in particular to India and China — after the loss of EU, its single largest energy customer.However, the two price-sensitive countries have been demanding huge discounts, according to a Bloomberg report on November 27.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

19,f183b9d3-9af3-3754-99f8-aaeaea1bc1a8,CRM,2023-02-13,The 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-tech-stocks-buy-203716124.html,1675975036,STORY,"['NFLX', 'MSFT', 'PI', 'META', 'CRM', 'STX', 'PODD']","[Tech stocks continue to be a major player in the stock market in 2023. Driven by ongoing innovation and investment, big-name turnarounds suggest that Feb. could be the beginning of a sharp upward trend for tech stocks. In fact, here are seven of the best tech stocks to consider for the year.PIImpinj$126.80METAMeta Platforms$178.17PODDInsulet Corporation$286.67MSFTMicrosoft$264.03STXSeagate Technology$69.43CRMSalesforce$172.56NFLXNetflix$362.79Best Tech Stocks: Impinj (PI) a visual representation of the internet connections crisscrossing the sky above a citySource: ShutterstockImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a technology company specializing in providing solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its products and services include radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems and software. Impinj’s tracking chips connect items and devices to the cloud. The RFID technology that underpins its products and services are especially useful for retail, logistics, and transportation sector firms that need to track physical assets for analytical and other purposes. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOne of the primary reasons to believe that PI stock will rise this month is its sales guidance. The company recently revised its current quarter guidance upward. Impinj had given a prior guidance range for this quarter between $71.5 to $73.5 million. However, it recently raised that guidance to at least $76 million for the quarter. That positive development, in combination with the positive Fed news of lower interest rate increases, should be a  powerful catalyst for Impinj. Best Tech Stocks: Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a prime example of how quickly fortunes can change for the better. The Facebook parent company had been largely jeered for its hard pivot to the metaverse during 2022. The tech company has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) solutions. The company is focused on creating immersive experiences through its hardware and software products. These products include AR smart glasses and VR headsets. But screenshots of its metaverse have become meme fodder. Detractors have gone so far as to suggest that the rebranding would be the death of the company. Story continuesBut the stock market is a place where a ‘what have you done for lately’ mentality rules. So Meta’s recent upbeat outlook, a $40 billion share buyback plan, and a renewed focus on efficiency are benefiting its shares in a big way. Meta’s revenues were dealt a blow when Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy measures reduced data access in early 2021. In response, Meta developed AI-based tools to improve ad targeting. Revenues could soon be higher than they were prior to Apple’s privacy changes. That strongly suggests that Meta is back and the story of its pivot is still being written. Insulet (PODD) image of the word diabetes surrounded by medical equipment.Source: Minerva Studio / Shutterstock.comInvestors should also consider Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD), a medical device company that specializes in insulin pump systems for people with diabetes. The company is well known for its ‘Omnipod’ insulin delivery system that offers a discreet and user-friendly option for people with insulin-dependent diabetes.Insulet won’t report earnings again until Feb. 23 but investors should understand that the firm’s growth has been impressive thus far. Q3 earnings, released in early Nov., showed revenues of $340.8 million. That represented a 23.7% increase on a year-over-year basis. Insulet’s Omnipod product accounted for $326.1 million, or 95.7% of the firm’s total revenues in Q3. Omnipod revenues grew 25.3% YoY. Insulet’s international Omnipod sales decreased 5.5% in Q3, to $88 million. But the company also received CE Mark approval in Q3 which opens up its international market access. It should be able to rebound and increase international sales while continuing its already strong top-line results. Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is still in limbo following its earnings release on Jan. 24. Analysts are digesting its weak overall sales growth, the lowest in six years. The result is trepidation that growth has stagnated at the company. Microsoft’s guidance for $51 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which would represent 3% growth, doesn’t help to reduce pessimism. But I think there’s good reason to believe that Microsoft is on the cusp of a new paradigm in which it is able to achieve a lot more with a lot less. The reason to believe that lies in its Azure cloud platform. Microsoft is heavily leveraging AI models into its cloud which grew 22% in the quarter with $27.1 billion in revenue. The company laid off 10,000 workers as tech firms seek greater efficiency. Overhead is shrinking while Azure and its AI investments promise greater productivity overall. Lower overall headcount reduces expenses. And AI investments could turbocharge Azure’s growth. The combination could fundamentally improve MSFT stock in a major way. Seagate Technology (STX) An image of different overlaid data chartsSource: solarseven/ShutterstockInvestors should also consider Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which specializes in data storage solutions. The company is one of the largest manufacturers of hard disk drives (HDD) in the world serving individuals and businesses. Its products are used in a wide range of end applications ranging from desktop computers to data centers. Seagate Technologies has already shown significant positive momentum in 2023. Shares have increased in price from $51.88 to $72.31 as of writing. Although STX shares are currently fully priced, meaning they trade at or above their target price, they can move higher.A high-level overview of Seagate Technologies suggests that its late 2022 business restructuring is being well received by the markets. While revenues dropped to $1.887 billion in the quarter, down from $3.116 billion a year ago, share prices are surging. The company is launching a 30-plus terabyte HAMR-based product family in the June quarter and it seems market anticipation is enough to keep prices rising. Salesforce (CRM) Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a technology company specializing in customer relationship management software. Its flagship product, also called Salesforce, is one of the most widely used CRM platforms in the world, offering a range of tools and services for sales, customer service, marketing, and more.  That said, Salesforce continues to face the dual threat of increasing competition and an economic downturn. Internally, Salesforce has suffered from a mix of low growth and profitability that decreased share prices substantially in 2022. Salesforce anticipates reaching $50 billion in revenues and 25% margins by early 2026 though skeptics remain. However, CRM stock has the might of powerful institutional investors behind it. Both Elliot Management and Inclusive Capital have taken significant positions (1)in the company. Salesforce remains the big dog in the customer relationship management software sector by far and that cannot be disregarded. Its dominant position is being challenged but sector leaders have a way of rebounding due to scale. Netflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) looks like one to consider this month and beyond. On the revenue front, Netflix reported $7.85 billion, up slightly from the $7.71 billion it recorded a year earlier. But the particularly positive news was that its subscriber growth of 7.66 million new users well exceeded the 4.5 million management had earlier projected. Netflix users have largely adopted its new ad-supported pricing updates without killing subscriber growth in the process. That’s the main takeaway investors should understand about Netflix. Its crackdown on password sharing hasn’t had the effect of slowing subscribership. And Netflix’s content continues to draw critical acclaim with titles like Wednesday, Glass Onion, Troll, and Harry and Meghan remaining popular. In short, it looks like Netflix may have weathered the worst of the storm and come out pretty strong as a result. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Realtor.com® Survey Finds that Housing Costs Impact Romantic Decisions,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/love-money-realtor-com-survey-110000597.html,1676286000.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Eighty percent of Gen Z respondents who have moved in with a romantic partner say that finances and/or logistics contributed to their decisionSANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Moving in with a romantic partner is a big step, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. However, when it comes to taking the next step in their relationship, 63% of people who have moved in with a romantic partner said that their decision was impacted by finances and/or logistics. Realtor.com® and HarrisX surveyed 3,009 consumers to highlight how today's expensive housing market is impacting people's love lives.""Living with a romantic partner might bring a couple closer together, but it can also magnify potential issues in a relationship,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor, Realtor.com®. ""While the idea of splitting the rent or mortgage can be very attractive, it's important to have tough conversations with your partner and think through how living together will work before you take the plunge.""Younger respondents were significantly more likely to be persuaded by money/logistics with 80% of Gen Z and 76% of Millennials saying that one or both of these things were a factor in moving in with a romantic partner. This is compared to 56% of Gen X, 44% of Baby Boomers who said the same thing.Will you be my… roommate?Unsurprisingly, among those who factored finances and/or logistics into their decision to move in with a partner, Gen Z respondents (56%) – who have faced notoriously high housing costs in their lifetime – were the most likely to say that saving money by splitting the rent/mortgage was a contributing factor. Additionally, 70% of all respondents who have moved in with a partner reported that they were able to save money by moving in. The most common amounts saved per month were:$1- $500 (27%)$501 - $1,000 (20%)$1,001 - $2,000 (13%)$2,001 - $5,000 (6%)More than $5,000 (4%)A significant percentage of respondents who have moved in with a partner moved into a home that one person already rented (37%) or owned (21%), while 30% decided to start fresh with a new rental and 9% took the leap directly into buying a home together.Story continuesDon't go breaking my heartNot all relationships work out and living with a partner isn't always easy. Forty-two percent of people who have moved in with a romantic partner ended up regretting the move. Reasons included:The relationship didn't work out (48%)We moved too fast/rushed the decision (31%)Realized we weren't compatible for co-living (27%)It made it harder to break up (26%)When we broke up it was stressful to divide the things that we had purchased together (22%)The stress of living together hurt our relationship (22%)The logistics of moving out after a breakup were too difficult (19%)We broke up soon after moving in together (17%)""When you're renting or purchasing real estate together, it's important to make sure you're both financially protected,"" said Trapasso. ""For example, if you're buying a home together as an unmarried couple, it may be a good idea to chat with a real estate attorney first to figure out what would happen with the home in the event that you broke up.""Will you accept this contract?Nearly a third (31%) of survey respondents who have moved in with a partner signed a contract outlining what would happen in the event of a break-up. Younger respondents were significantly more likely to have signed a contract, with 54% of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials doing so. This suggests that younger generations might be more financially and/or legally savvy and understand the importance of protecting their investments.MethodologyThe survey was conducted online from Feb. 1-4, 2023 among 3,009 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of this poll is +/- 1.8 percentage points and larger for subgroups (including those who have moved in with a partner at +/- 2.3 percentage points). The results reflect a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Results were weighted for age by gender, region, race/ethnicity, and income where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The latest announcements however fell short of investor expectations and Google's share price plummeted by more than seven percent on February 7 amid growing doubts that the company will fend off its rival. (Photo by NOAH BERGER / AFP) (Photo by NOAH BERGER/AFP via Getty Images) - NOAH BERGER/AFP via Getty ImagesLast week Google invited the world to marvel at how clever its latest artificial intelligence (AI) software is, but it all went horribly wrong.Over $100bn was wiped from the share price of Google’s parent company Alphabet overnight as a result. Executives no doubt wish they’d kept the product to themselves.Interestingly the software actually did OK, as these things go. The haphazard answers spewed out by Google’s new AI chatbot, Bard, were just as poor as those generated by the software it sought to eclipse: ChatGPT.In just a few weeks, OpenAI’s chatbot has captured the imagination of the media, and created a minor speculative bubble in the tech world. Last week Microsoft began to introduce this automatic text generator into its search engine and its Office products like Word.“Microsoft and OpenAI have introduced pretty much the same product – with worse flaws – but were met with adulation as opposed to derision,” notes the former Nomura Securities analyst Richard Windsor, wryly.One reason is that journalists and analysts are not really dispassionate – they see what they want to see. Much like audience members at an illusionist’s show, they become part of the performance, and in a sense, complete the magic trick. Later participants can’t believe how easily they were bamboozled when the misdirection was so obvious.Critics who were thrilled by ChatGPT in December simply saw through the sleight of hand when the same trick was performed by Google.For a misdirection it surely is. ChatGPT faithfully churns outs pastiche text based on statistical models of material it has ingested. Similar services churn out amazing pictures too. Think of it as a spectacular, but completely dumb, version of the Autocomplete feature that’s built into your word processor that completes your letter with a “Yours sincerely” and your name.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a keynote address announcing ChatGPT integration for Bing at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, on February 7, 2023. - Microsoft's long-struggling Bing search engine will integrate the powerful capabilities of language-based artificial intelligence, CEO Satya Nadella said, declaring what he called a new era for online search. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) - JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty ImagesIn reality, it has no idea of what it’s doing. Windsor accurately calls it “a clever innovation capable of creating the illusion of sentience, that is easily shattered with even a small dose of reality.”Story continuesThese bots are not only very expensive to run, they are creating downstream social costs to which their makers seem oblivious.In 2023, our digital world is awash with spam and fakes, and we must navigate vast amounts of derivative and unoriginal material. Why would we want to unleash a tool that creates even more rubbish?Ah, say the AI advocates – that’s missing the point. ChatGPT will be useful because so many of our everyday exchanges already follow a predictable pattern or a template, and the bot recognises these patterns, and mimics them. An example often cited is generating the covering letter of a resume, which assuredly is not the place a job applicant should be getting funky and creative.But generating this filler may not be necessary at all. The author and education blogger John Warner captures the limitations of the latest generative AI very well in an essay entitled “ChatGPT can’t kill anything worth preserving”.Right now, if generative AI can do something, he points out, that something probably isn’t worth doing in the first place.Does the resume need a cover letter? Probably not. Could that two page analysis be condensed into three bullet points? Very probably. No wonder the waffling classes – such as futurists and consultants – are fascinated by it.  AI automates the creation of waffle and piffle brilliantly – and so demonstrates that organisations can do away with huge swathes of their consultants.Nevertheless, tech companies persist and AI chatbots are already racking up substantial social costs. Last week France’s elite university Sciences Po – which has incubated six of the eight Presidents of the Fifth Republic – became the latest institution to ban students from using ChatGPT to generate their essays without transparent referencing.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a keynote address announcing ChatGPT integration for Bing at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, on February 7, 2023. - Microsoft's long-struggling Bing search engine will integrate the powerful capabilities of language-based artificial intelligence, CEO Satya Nadella said, declaring what he called a new era for online search. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) - JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images“The sanctions for use of the software may go as far as exclusion from the institution, or even from French higher education as a whole,” an administrator warned.If schools and universities need to, they’ll disable Word, or uninstall it altogether – a consequence that the market has not yet factored into Microsoft’s share price.Institutions are already thinking about how to redesign courses to reduce the amount of home learning – where cheating is easy –  and rely more on in-hall exams, where they can be better invigilated. That isn’t cheap.So this is pollution and it has a cost. Fortunately, economists know exactly what to do. The cost is what it is referred to as an externality. In 1920, the Cambridge economist Arthur Pigou, a winner of the Adam Smith Prize, introduced the idea of taxing these externalities – so the polluter pays.Paul Sanders, a digital music entrepreneur, who like Pigou approaches the problem from a classical liberal perspective, explains it so: “The external costs from ChatGPT are the teachers’ time and effort, and pupils’ lack of learning caused by cheating at school, incorrect advice followed, and the extra efforts human creators need to compete. A tax is the simplest and most effective way to deal with gains and losses that fall to those outside of a transaction.”Big Tech will doubtless baulk at such a proposition. The industry is unable to acknowledge the pollution it creates. But we have an elegant and liberal solution to such digital effluence: It’s time to tax the bots.]"

Unlike the metaverse which faces huge difficulty in finding real-life application, ChatGPT has suddenly helped us achieve human-computer interaction,"" said Ding Daoshi, an independent internet analyst and former director of Beijing-based consultancy Sootoo. ""The changes it will bring about are more immediate, more direct and way quicker.""OpenAI or ChatGPT itself is not blocked by Chinese authorities but OpenAI does not allow users in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia and parts of Africa to sign up.OpenAI told Reuters it is working to make its services more widely available.“While we would like to make our technology available everywhere, conditions in certain countries make it difficult or impossible for us to do so in a way that is consistent with our mission,"" the San Francisco-based firm said in an emailed statement. ""We are currently working to increase the number of locations where we can provide safe and beneficial access to our tools.""Story continuesIn December, Tencent Holdings' WeChat, China's biggest messaging app, shut several ChatGPT-related programmes that had appeared on the network, according to local media reports, but they have continued to spring up.Dozens of bots rigged to ChatGPT technology have emerged on WeChat, with hobbyists using it to make programmes or automated accounts that can interact with users. At least one account charges users a fee of 9.99 yuan ($1.47) to ask 20 questions.Tencent did not respond to Reuters' request for comments.ChatGPT supports Chinese language interaction and is highly capable of conversing in Chinese, which has helped drive its unofficial adoption in the country.Chinese firms also use proxy tools or existing partnerships with Microsoft, which is investing billions of dollars in its OpenAI, to access tools that allow them to embed AI technology into their products.Shenzhen-based Proximai in December introduced a virtual character into its 3D game-like social app who used ChatGPT's underlying tech to converse. Beijing-based entertainment software company Kunlun Tech plans to incorporate ChatGPT in its web browser Opera.SleekFlow, a Tiger Global-backed startup in Hong Kong, said it was integrating the AI into its customer relations messaging tools. ""We have clients all over the world,"" Henson Tsai, SleekFlow's founder said. ""Among other things, ChatGPT does excellent translations, sometimes better than other solutions available on the market.""CENSORSHIPReuters' tests of ChatGPT indicate that the chatbot is not averse to questions that would be sensitive in mainland China. Asked for its thoughts on Chinese President Xi Jinping, for instance, it responded it does not have personal opinions and presented a range of views.But some of its proxy bots on WeChat have blacklisted such terms, according to other Reuters checks, complying with China's heavy censorship of its cyberspace. When asked the same question about Xi on one ChatGPT proxy bot, it responded by saying that the conversation violated rules.To comply with Chinese rules, Proximai's founder Will Duan said his platform would filter information presented to users during their interaction with ChatGPT.Chinese regulators, which last year introduced rules to strengthen governance of ""deepfake"" technology, have not commented on ChatGPT, however, state media this week warned about stock market risks amid a frenzy over local ChatGPT-concept stocks.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the internet regulator, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.""With the regulations released last year, the Chinese government is saying: we already see this technology coming and we want to be ahead of the curve,"" said Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University.""I fully expect the great majority of the AI-generated content to be non-political.""CHINESE RIVALSJoining the buzz have been some of the country's largest tech giants such as Baidu and Alibaba who gave updates this week on AI models they have been working on, prompting their shares to zoom.Baidu said this week it would complete internal testing of its ""Ernie Bot"" in March, a big AI model the search firm has been working on since 2019.On Wednesday, Alibaba said that its research institute Damo Academy was also testing a ChatGPT-style tool.Duan, whose company has been using a Baidu AI chatbot named Plato for natural language processing, said ChatGPT was at least a generation more powerful than China's current NLP solutions, though it was weaker in some areas, such as understanding conversation context.Baidu did not reply to Reuters' request for comments.Access to OpenAI's GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first launched in 2020, an update of which is the backbone of ChatGPT.Duan said potential long-term compliance risks mean Chinese companies would most likely replace ChatGPT with a local alternative, if they could match the U.S.-developed product's functionality.""So we actually hope that there can be alternative solutions in China which we can directly use... it may handle Chinese even better, and it can also better comply with regulations,"" he said.($1 = 6.7875 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Sam Holmes)]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Cloud Stocks Under $10 According To Hedge Funds.Major Cloud players in the market, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), are facing massive headwinds amid slowing demand and spending as companies cut back on expenses amid rising interest rates. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares fell sharply in January after investment firm UBS in a note highlighted some concerns related to the growth of the company’s Azure Cloud platform. UBS said that Microsoft Azure is entering a growth deceleration phase that would worsen in FY23/FY24. What alarmed investors was UBS concern that this growth slowdown might be related to growth maturation instead of the global macro environment.UBS note came after Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) gave soft guidance for Azure’s revenue growth. Interestingly, when Microsoft posted quarterly results — which showed Azure’s strong growth in the period — several Cloud stocks, including MongoDB Inc., Datadog Inc. and Snowflake, jumped. But later, these stocks retreated as investors digested Microsoft’s weak guidance.Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn’t the only company facing headwinds in the Cloud industry. Major players in the market including Amazon and Google are facing a slowdown in growth. A Bloomberg report on February 8 said that rate of growth for each of the three market leaders in the Cloud industry — Amazon, Google and Microsoft — fell at least 10 percentage points from the previous nine months. The report also cited Rikin Shah, founder and chief executive officer of Slower.ai, who thinks that the growth is slowing down because companies are cutting back on spending and are trying to cut costs.The report said that most of the Cloud services charge customers based on usage. So, when times are tough, companies can easily cut back on Cloud spending by decreasing their usage. Some other important factors adding to the growth worries of Cloud companies are a rapid slowdown in some markets that were previously major users of the industry. The report said that the slowdown in the crypto market and mortgage lending industry is negatively affecting the growth in the Cloud industry.Story continuesBut just because the market leaders in the industry are facing a slowdown doesn’t mean the broader Cloud industry is on a decline. In fact the opposite is true. The Cloud industry is rapidly growing as small businesses continue to migrate to Cloud platforms to decrease their costs and increase performance. A research report estimates that the global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% in the forecast period of 2023-2028 and reach $810 billion in value by 2026.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayThat’s why in this article we decided to focus on small Cloud stocks that have long-term growth catalysts.Our MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds’ holdings and picked top 10 Cloud computing stocks that are trading under $10 and have Forward PE ratios less than the software industry’s PE ratio as of February 9.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Promising Small-Cap Stocks According to Analysts.Investing in small-cap stocks can be a great way to diversify your portfolio and get in on the ground floor of a promising company. Small-cap stocks are stocks with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion, and are usually considered to be more volatile than large-cap stocks. But, with the potential for higher returns, small-cap stocks can be attractive investments for those willing to take on a bit more risk.Before investing in small-cap stocks, it’s important to understand the risks involved. Small-cap stocks are usually less liquid than your typical blue chips which include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Additionally, since small-cap stocks are typically less well-known and researched, they can be more susceptible to price manipulation or market volatility.BofA Analyst Bullish on Small-CapsOn January 7 BofA's Head of US Small/Mid Cap Strategy, Jill Carey Hall, appeared on CNBC where she made the bull case for owning small-cap stocks in 2023. Hall noted that small-caps are discounting an economic downturn and that they are trading at attractive valuations. Hall said ""valuations today are very compelling"" and that ""if you look at what happened in the 70s to early 80s, which was another backdrop when the Fed was trying to tame inflation, small-caps were the best-performing asset class from the mid-70s to the early 80s"".Hall sees a similar macroeconomic backdrop today and sees small-caps driving outperformance relative to large-caps. Hall noted that ""CapEx is going to remain more resilient"" into a downturn and ""small-caps typically benefit from CapEx"". Moreover, Hall said that historically small-caps have shown to have had more pricing power than large-caps in ""environments where inflation's remained sticky"". Here are some comments from Jill Carey Hall about what she sees ahead for U.S. equities in 2023:Story continues""We do see more downside risk to U.S. equities overall, near-term, given our view that we will have a mild U.S. recession. But we do think that large-caps may actually have more downside risk than small-caps, near-term. And then once the market bottoms, that obviously tends to be the best time to own small-caps.""Investing in small-cap stocks can be a risky endeavor and there is no guarantee of success. As with any investment, investors should exercise due diligence, evaluate their risk tolerance, and understand the potential risk and reward associated with the investment before committing capital. Let's now look at some of the most promising small-cap stocks to invest in according to Wall Street analysts.12 Most Promising Small-cap Stocks According to AnalystsOur MethodologyWe screened for small-cap stocks that held consensus positive ratings among Wall Street analysts.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:18% = US$4.4b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Archer-Daniels-Midland's exceptional 20% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Archer-Daniels-Midland's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is ADM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether ADM is currently mispriced by the market.Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Archer-Daniels-Midland's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 35%, meaning the company retains 65% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Archer-Daniels-Midland is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Additionally, Archer-Daniels-Midland has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 31%. However, Archer-Daniels-Midland's future ROE is expected to decline to 10% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

To skip our detailed analysis of inflation-resistant companies and sectors, you can go directly to see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.The worst economic recession recession recorded in recent history was the 2008 global financial crisis. The crisis began within the US housing market, with home prices rising rapidly in the late 1990s and exceeding income growth by 2000. This created a housing bubble consisting of record-breaking prices for housing in the US, which eventually burst and led to a market collapse for subprime mortgages. In the aftermath, the whole world was forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, with the after-effects of the crisis leaking into the global economy. By analysing the market in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, and later with additional market research post-COVID-19, financial researchers and analysts have managed to pinpoint several industries that fare well during an economic downturn.As a result, companies operating within these industries like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are often considered to be money-makers in times of recession. According to McKinsey report published in 2009, recession-resistant industries include consumer staples, healthcare, telecommunication services, and utilities, among more. In 2008, the total returns to shareholders fell for all sectors by over 20%, but consumer staples was an exception to this.A look at the utilities industry, another traditional recession-proof sector, clarified that companies operating in this area were also able to perform much better than others. KPMG's report on European power and utilities, published in 2021, showed that the deal value of the European power and utilities sector rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021. This came about as a result of higher power prices in the aftermath of the COVID-19 economic downturn. Another example of a fairly recession-resistant industry is the healthcare sector. Research shared by Cushman &amp; Wakefield shows that between 1967 and 2019, American spending on healthcare has been on the rise, even during the recessionary years of 2007-2009. Healthcare spending has been roughly doubling every 13 years, with it accounting for about 18% of the US GDP in 2019, up from 13% in 2000. Consumer spending also steadily rose in the healthcare industry for over 60 years. Between 1959 and 2019, the average annual growth rate was calculated at 3.7%. This stands in stark contrast to the general belief that consumer spending always drops during recessions, and goes to show that some industries can conversely benefit in times of recession, as they offer products and services that cannot be cut out of everyday life for most people.Story continues10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.Let's now take a look at 10 companies and industries that make money during a recession.Our MethodologyWe have combined data from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis and Bloomberg to pick 10 companies that have proven to perform well during the global recession in 2008. To measure their resistance to recessions, we have considered their stock performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 during 2008, using Yahoo Finance's historical stock price data where needed. We also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the company's stocks. They are ranked based on their outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008, from the lowest to the highest percentage.Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 8.8%The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a world-renowned entertainment company. It operates through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments. The company is based in Burbank, California.On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall reiterated an Overweight rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares, alongside a $125 price target.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has diversified its business to include not only media entertainment but also recreational theme parks and experiences. One result of such diversification has been the company's resilience in times of economic turmoil. During the 2008 financial crisis, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 8.8%. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while Disney's theme parks and cruise business were shut down, Disney+ streaming subscriptions surged to include 73.7 million subscribers by November 2020, relative to the company's goal to reach between 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024. Such growth allowed the company to outperform the S&amp;P 500 by 9% in 2020 as well.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a recession-resistant company investors should look at today.9. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)Industry: Information TechnologyS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 9.9%Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is an application software company providing electronic design automation software products used in the design and testing of integrated circuits. The company is based in Mountain View, California.Peter Sazel at Atlantic Equities re-initiated coverage of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) shares on January 17 with an Overweight rating and a $390 price target.Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a leading technology company that offers a platform for the testing of semiconductor chips and software applications. Analysts consider the semiconductor industry to be a secular growth market, meaning the demand for chip testing and designing services is likely to remain constant even during recessions. This belief is supported by the performance of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) during the 2008 recession when the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 9.9%. Even during the market downturn in 2020, the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 70%.TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, mentioned Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“New to the strategy this quarter was Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), a provider of electronic design automation software products used to design and test integrated circuits. The electronic design automation market is a essentially a duopoly with one other major player in the space. As such, the barriers to entry are very high and will likely remain that way due to rising chip complexity.”8. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS)Industry: Communication ServicesS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 14.8%T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is a wireless telecommunication services company providing mobile communications services in the US, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company is based in Bellevue, Washington.An Overweight rating was reiterated on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) shares on January 5 by analyst Philip Cusick at JPMorgan. The analyst also placed a $200 price target on the stock.T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) has become the second-largest US wireless provider after its merger with Sprint. The company managed to beat the odds during the global 2008 recession by outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by 14.8%. It also outperformed the benchmark index by 55.7% in 2020. Since T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is now an even more significant player in the communication services industry, it may prove to be recession-resistant in the coming years as well, due to its ability to outgrow its primary competitors.7. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 21.37%Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another entertainment and streaming company on our list. It offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and more on its platform. The company has recently also added mobile games across different genres and languages to its arsenal of products.Joseph Bonner at Argus holds a Buy rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares as of January 23. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $340 to $390.Between October 9, 2007, and March 9, 2009, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) brought in a total return of 68.9%, according to Bloomberg. The company is also a lower-cost entertainment option compared to peers like The Walt Disney Company, ensuring that during recessions, consumers on the lookout for cheaper entertainment options would gravitate toward it. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 21.37% in 2008, and its subscriber growth increased by 26% to 9.3 million during the same year. This shows that the company was able to actually perform better during an economic downturn.Polen Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has nearly doubled since its May 2022 lows and was our top performer for both the quarter and the year. In the summer, we added to our position meaningfully after our research indicated that the company’s two new monetization levers (requiring fees for shared passwords and the introduction of an advertising-supported subscription) would be very additive to the company’s revenue and profits beginning in early 2023. The company has since announced plans to disallow password sharing, which should provide a boost to revenue and profit growth nearly immediately as account holders or those that are borrowing passwords are required to pay to continue to watch Netflix content. The ad-supported subscription tier should also be a clear positive, not only for the company’s financials but also for consumers and marketers alike. While the subscription fee for the ad-supported tier is only about $7/month in the U.S., the ad revenue per subscriber that Netflix earns for consumers choosing this option could easily add another $15 per month or more in the U.S., potentially making Netflix’s ad-supported subscription tier the company’s most revenue generative and profitable. Even if more premium subscribers than expected downgrade to the adsupported option, we think there should be significant revenue uplift for Netflix. It appears market participants have been doing this math as well, driving the stock price higher over the last seven months.”6. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Industry: Home Improvement RetailS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 23.9%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a consumer discretionary company operating Home Depot stores across the US. The company sells home improvement products, maintenance, repair, and operations products, and much more. It is based in Atlanta, Georgia.On December 13, Max Rakhlenko at Cowen reiterated an Outperform rating on The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $350 to $379.Typically, sales for a company like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) would fall during a recession because of decreased consumer spending. However, the company is well-versed in allocating capital in a way that grows its value. Over the past 10 years, the company's profit margin increased from 6% to 11%. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 23.9% in 2008. Additionally, in 2020 it was seen that interest rate cuts and a lack of entertainment activities in 2020 actually led to a boom in the housing and home improvement markets. So in 2020, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) outperformed the benchmark index by 5.3% as well.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a company that has managed to beat the odds during recessions in the past, making it a safe option for investors as well.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession. Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for RecessionJim Cramer's Recession-Proof Stocks14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A RecessionDisclosure: None. 10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:PM) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 9, 2023Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2022 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.James Bushnell: Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for the smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly-comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until November 11, 2023.As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022 and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.Jacek Olczak: Thank you, James and welcome everyone. We had a remarkable year for our smoke-free transformation in 2022. Despite the exceptional challenges of the war in Ukraine, severe supply-chain disruptions and global inflation, we delivered very strong financial performance and took two major strategic strides towards a smoke-free future. I would like to express my deepest thanks to all my colleagues who spared no effort to drive excellent business results during these unprecedented times. Our thoughts also continue to be with those affected by the war in Ukraine and the recent tragedy in Turkey and Syria. In 2022, PMI delivered its second consecutive year of total volume growth, reflecting continued IQOS progress and broadly stable cigarette volumes.Story continuesFull-year smoke-free net revenues reached almost one third of total PMI and over 50% in 17 markets. This is impressive progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by net revenues in 2025. IQOS outstanding results continued with over 21% full-year growth in both shipment volumes and in market sales excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects broad-based momentum in the European Union Region, Japan and emerging markets. IQOS ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth in its launch markets with upgrades from existing users and new user acquisition outperforming our initial expectations. The success is supported by the increasing deployment of a two-tier heated tobacco units portfolio providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high quality alternatives to cigarettes.In combustibles, we delivered a robust performance with a 3.7% growth in organic net revenues and 0.3 percentage points higher share of segment excluding Russia and Ukraine despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free products. We also achieved two critical strategic milestones this year, reaching an agreement to take full control of IQOS in the U.S. in 2024 and successfully completing the acquisition of Swedish Match. These achievements will accelerate our smoke-free journey and further position us to lead the transformation of the wider industry. Clearly currency headwinds were extremely strong and weighed on our U.S.s dollar performance but although volatility remains, I am pleased that they seem to significantly abate in 2023.Overall, 2022 was a pivotal year and we look forward with confidence to 2023 and beyond. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for the coming year. With the acquisition of Swedish Match and securing the rights to IQOS in the U.S., we are now a global smoke-free champion. The addition of the world's biggest market and the leading nicotine pouch brand ZYN alongside IQOS provides us with significant untapped opportunities to further accelerate the growth of smoke-free products. As the strength of our IQOS business continues to grow rapidly, the full global rollout of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority and we expect to make substantial progress on this in 2023. The success of ILUMA in launch market so far demonstrates the importance of groundbreaking consumer-centric innovation and we continue to broaden our portfolio with new science backed offerings.This includes BONDS by IQOS, our latest heat-not-burn device aimed at low and middle-income adult smokers. Pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines in the last quarter of last year show encouraging early results and we intend to take the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale. Following a successful first three years of partnership with KT&amp;G, we also recently extended our long-term s their innovative smoke-free portfolio outside South Korea. I am very pleased to welcome Swedish Match to the PMI family. In particular, the fast-growing potential of ZYN is an incredibly exciting addition to our company. We are focused on supporting the Swedish Match team to continue and accelerate ZYN's outstanding success in the U.S. while also leveraging PMI commercial capabilities to prepare for the international expansion of nicotine pouches.IQOS and ZYN are premium brands, leading the global categories. In the U.S., ZYN is helping the American smokers leave cigarettes behind and offers great growth prospects. For IQOS, the world's biggest smoke-free market is a fully untapped opportunity and our plans are well underway in anticipation of our commercialization in the second-quarter of 2024. We will be leveraging the sales and distribution capabilities of Swedish Match and deploying our commercial model digital engine organization and infrastructure for a successful rollout. We continue to expect to file an FDA application for ILUMA in the second half of 2023. Logically, the international expansion of pouches, U.S. IQOS preparation and the replacement of IQOS 3 with ILUMA entail additional investments this year, which combined with inflationary pressures will weigh temporarily on our margins.Indeed, many of the ILUMA related costs are one-off in nature as Emmanuel will explain shortly. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions. As we have explained previously, maintaining our leadership in combustibles helps us maximize switching to smoke-free products through the connection to adult smokers and the retail trade. In terms of our financials, the strength of our business provides a robust operating cash flow, which we intend to maximize to provide reinvestment in our smoke-free business, deleveraging and growing the dividend. Finally and importantly, shaping tobacco harm reduction by providing better alternative to smokers and advocating for science-based regulation is critical to accelerate the end of smoking.Harm reduction is also at the core of our transformation, as we lead on sustainability to achieve a positive impact. We will be expanding on some of these topics at the CAGNY conference on February 22nd and we also plan to host an Investor Day in September this year, where we will go into greater detail on our strategies and future vision particularly with regard to --with regards to the U.S. Now, I will hand it over to Emmanuel, to discuss our results in 2023 and outlook in more detail.Emmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. Our business driven by the strength of our innovative and expanding smoke-free portfolio generated excellent top and bottom-line 2022 growth despite a very difficult operating environment, and currency headwinds. Our full-year net revenues grew organically by plus 7.7% excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 7.1% for total PMI, despite the impact of hyper-inflationary accounting in Turkey. This reflect the continued strength of IQOS, accelerating pricing and the recovery of combustibles in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison, notably in H1. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of our full-year smoke-free net revenue, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Our net revenue per unit grew plus 4.4% organically, excluding Russia and Ukraine and by plus 5.5% in total.This was driven by combustible pricing of plus 4%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 5% overall and the positive mix impact of an increasing proportion of HTUs heated tobacco unit in our overall volumes at higher net revenue per unit. Our 2022 operating income margin contracted organically by 60 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine, and by 70 basis-points in total due to a number of headwinds, which I will come back to. These headwinds were partially mitigated by the growth of IQOS, pricing and ongoing cost-saving. In 2022, we delivered gross saving of $800 million, with over $1.6 billion in the first two years of our cost-efficiency program. This puts us well on track to exceed our target of $2 billion over 2021, 2023 and mitigate recent inflationary pressures.Despite margin pressures, our excellent top-line growth and diligent cost management enabled us to deliver currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11.9% to $5.34, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes unfavorable currency of $0.85 and a small contribution from Swedish Match net of financing cost for the 50 days of consolidated results. For total PMI, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98. We also had a strong finish to the year. We delivered excellent Q4 organic net revenue growth of plus 7.9%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Again, reflecting continued strong IQOS performance and robust combustible pricing. Our Q4 operating income margin expanded organically by 80 basis-points, excluding Russia and Ukraine mainly due to a favorable comparison.On the total PMI basis, organic margin were flat including the impact of a challenging comparison in Ukraine and shipment timing in Russia. Fourth quarter currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 20.8% to $1.23, excluding Russia and Ukraine and plus 15.3% in total to $1.39, an excellent performance. Before discussing our 2023 guidance, I would like to provide an update on our Ukraine and Russia businesses. We continue to support our employees in Ukraine. I would like to personally thank them for their tremendous efforts to secure our business continuity during these extremely difficult times. In Russia, the environment for divestment has become increasingly challenging and complex, especially given recent December 2022 regulatory developments.To provide more clarity to investors on the full extent of our business, we will now include both Ukraine and Russia in our 2023 outlook and reporting. Now turning to the 2023 outlook, we expect to deliver very strong organic net revenue growth of plus 7% to plus 8.5%, supported by a step-up in combustible pricing and another year of rapid progress from IQOS. This would represent the third consecutive year of organic top-line growth above plus 7% and excludes the impact of Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Including Swedish Match, we expect our reported currency-neutral net revenues to grow into the teens as its business continue to deliver strong performance. We expect excellent IQOS momentum to increase our HTU volume growth on the total PMI basis supported by the growing presence of ILUMA across our key markets.We forecast between 125 billion and 130 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 15% to plus 19% growth. This reflects an acceleration compared to the total PMI growth rate in 2022 despite an expectation of no significant progress in Russia given our decision to restrict investment and innovation. As mentioned previously, the pace of ILUMA launches has also been constrained by supply-chain disruption and the outstanding take up in initial launch markets. We expect these constraint to gradually improve through the first half as we progressively roll-out to more geographies. We expect organic smoke-free net revenue growth to have an aligned progression with the rate of HTU volume growth this year with less distortion from device revenues.Including Swedish Match and at constant-currency, we expect to deliver around $13.5 billion in smoke-free net revenue compared to $10 billion in 2022 and to approach 40% of total PMI net revenues this year. While our topline outlook is very strong, like many other global companies, we are facing significant margin pressure from the intensifying inflationary environment in addition to a number of specific transitory factors and investment, which I will come back to shortly. As a result, we expect our adjusted operating income margin to contract between 50 to 150 basis-points organically. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This includes a full year's positive contribution from Swedish Match net of the related interest expense.However, this benefit is offset by the increased interest cost on our non-Swedish Match debt and planned investments. This translate into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.25 to $6.37, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. This forecast notably, does not factor any potential favorable court ruling in Germany regarding the legality of the surcharge on the existing excise tax on heated tobacco product effective in Germany. as of 2022. We continue to account for the excise surcharge in our results and outlook. However, the obligation to pay the surcharge is currently suspended. If favorable the difference to our forecasted 2023 excise payment would increase our net revenue by around 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth by around three point, thereby increasing our forecast currency-neutral growth range to plus 10% to plus 12%.In this scenario, we would expect our operating cash flow would move towards the upper half of our forecast range. We expect a judgment towards the end of the year. There are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook, we expect total international industry volumes of cigarettes and heated tobacco units excluding China and the U.S. to decline by minus 1% to minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product and the growth of the category, we expect to gain share and target total PMI shipment volume to be flat to plus 1%, which would represent the third consecutive year of growth. While we seek to maintain our share of the combustible category, given the current inflationary environment, we assume combustible pricing will accelerate to around plus 6% on an organic basis compared to the plus 5% realized in 2022.Cigarettes, Industry, SmokePhoto by Irina Iriser on UnsplashWe also expect full-year capital expenditure of around $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2022, reflecting increased investment behind our smoke-free platform including ILUMA and Swedish Match portfolio. Let me now come back to the various factors impacting our margins. In 2022, total PMI gross margin contracted by 220 basis points organically. While growing inflationary pressures were a drag, the largest impact came from the combination of the rapid growth of ILUMA and transitory factors such as supply-chain disruption and the need to use air-freight. ILUMA drove accelerated device replacement from existing user in Japan and other launch market. Such devices sales are positive for acquisition, retention and full conversion. However, devices are margin-dilutive and this dynamic is likely to continue on a temporary basis, as we roll out to more markets this year and consumers upgrade from IQOS blade.The initially higher weight and cost of ILUMA consumable also played a role and this meant that the overall impact of our heat-not-burn business including devices was margin-dilutive in 2022. Importantly, average gross margin on HTUs remain around 10 percentage points higher than for cigarettes on the higher net revenue per unit. This is a fundamental long-term positive margin driver through the growing HTU volume mix in our business and this had a plus 110 basis-point favorable impact in 2022. Our two other key long-term margin drivers of pricing and productivities also continued to contribute favorably. Gross margin headwinds were mitigated at the operating income margin level by SG&amp;A cost which declined by 150 basis-points of net revenues, due primarily to cost-efficiency, operating leverage and comparison effect.The picture for 2023 is quite different while our gross margin will face increased inflationary pressure, this is now primarily due to COGS for the cigarette business as leaf, acetate tow, salaries and energy cost increase. An acceleration in combustible pricing and lower air freight cost will serve to mitigate this exceptional inflation. However, a time lag is built into our projections. Importantly, while cost inflation is also headwind for IQOS, the 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business is expected to be favorable due to the positive impact of increased HTU volume at higher net revenue per unit, planned ILUMA efficiencies and a more measured increase in device volumes. Overall, this underlying strength from IQOS combined with pricing will not be sufficient to offset combustible cost inflation in 2023, however, we expect a lower organic gross margin decline compared to last year and for our heat-not-burn business, to have an increasingly visible positive impact as we approach 2024.2023 SG&amp;A cost would include incremental investments to drive future growth, including in the commercialization of ILUMA. Also included is around $150 million with a broadly even split between the U.S., where we are preparing our organization capability for the launch of IQOS and wellness and healthcare investment in product development and clinical trials. In addition to inflation, this mean an SG&amp;A cost increase more in line with net revenue growth is likely with limited margin impacts. A few words now on 2023 phasing. We expect margin pressures to be weighted to the first half, particularly given the challenging Q1 2022 comparison and a progressive decrease in airfreight cost throughout the year. In addition, investment are expected to be front loaded and we know that the rollout to ILUMA can lead to a short period of slower user acquisition as consumer wait for the launch.Combined with the timing of shipment and cost saving, we expect our 2023 top and bottom line delivery to be heavily H2 weighted. Indeed, we expect the first quarter to be the most challenging with low-single digit organic topline growth and soft margin. Shipment timing and ILUMA launch impact are expected to be pronounced and we accordingly expect HTU shipment volume of around 26 billion to 28 billion HTUs. We also face a comparison with a significantly lower impact from war related disruption. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.33, including $0.10 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. Importantly, we expect margin to improve as we approach 2024 as headwinds relent and the fundamental margin-accretive driver of our smoke-free transformation continue in the form of heated tobacco unit growth, pricing and cost optimization on ILUMA.Our cash flow generation remains strong. We delivered $10.8 billion in 2022 operating cash flows representing plus 3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This include a favorable timing of certain financing item of around $0.3 billion. Given nonrecurring item and working capital movement benefited 2021 by around $1 billion, this was an excellent result. In 2023, we forecast $10 billion to $11 billion in operating cash-flow despite the notable expected impact from higher working capital requirements due to growth, global inflation and the reversal of one-off timing benefits. This put us on track to deliver our '21, '23 target of around $35 billion given in February 2021 at then prevailing rates. While our net debt is 2.9 times adjusted EBITDA on a 12 months trailing basis, this reflects only 50 days of Swedish Match results, including a full-year contribution for Swedish Match would clearly result in a lower ratio.We target robust EBITDA growth, which combined with strong cash flow allows us to focus on deleveraging, while continuing to invest in innovation and the growth of our business. In addition, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our 2022 results, both our HTU and in-market sales volume increased by around 21.5% supporting total volume growth of plus 3.2%, excluding Russia and Ukraine. Q4 HTU shipment volume grew by plus 37.5%, partly reflecting the replenishment of inventory for ILUMA in Japan, following lower shipment earlier in the year and favorable shipment timing in the EU, notably in advance of new ILUMA launches. Supported by very solid cigarette performance, we delivered total volume growth for the second consecutive year, both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine.Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of plus 3.7% for the full-year excluding Russia and Ukraine. Combustible pricing increased in H2 as we continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. This resulted in Q4 organic pricing of plus 4.8%, excluding Russia and Ukraine and yielded full-year pricing in line with our expectation with notable contribution from Germany, the Philippines and Turkey, despite the impact of hyperinflationary accounting. In 2022, our share of the cigarette category increased by plus 0.3 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine following category share declines in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by the pandemic. This includes sequential growth in every quarter of 2022.Marlboro remains extremely resilient despite pressure on disposable income and the impact of IQOS cannibalization with plus 0.2 percentage point share of segment growth. In addition, while we have not yet seen any meaningful acceleration in down trading, our share in the low price segment increased by plus 0.6 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine. As Jacek mentioned earlier, maintaining our leadership in the cigarette category is a key enabler in accelerating smokers switching to better alternative. Our robust cigarette share combined with the growth of IQOS delivered an overall market-share gain of plus 0.6 point in 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, with notable contribution from Egypt, Italy, Japan and Poland. PMI heated tobacco unit continue to strengthen the position towards becoming the largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present and reached the number two position in 2022 with a record-high share of 8.5% in Q4.Now focusing on IQOS user growth, there were an estimated 20.3 million IQOS user as of December 31st, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflect growth of around plus 3.5 million for the full year. For total PMI, we estimate there were almost 25 million IQOS users as of year-end. Consistent with comments in our recent disclosures, user growth in October and November was slower due to higher-than-expected impact from commercial activity and lower acquisition for IQOS brand product in anticipation of the launch of ILUMA in certain key markets. However, we saw a strong rebound in December as ILUMA launches continued delivering robust user growth of plus $0.8 million for the quarter. This actually was close to our initial expectation and we look forward with confidence to 2023 as ILUMA continues to be deployed.ILUMA is driving volume and share growth across its market supporting our strong position in heat-not-burn category. We launched in eight new markets in Q4, including the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, and South Korea, bringing the total to 16 markets with ILUMA launched now represent more than half of our total HTU volume. ILUMA delivers a superior consumer experience as evidenced by net promoter scores which on average increased by more than 10 points across its different market archetypes and higher conversion rate compared to IQOS. While the rate of acceleration differ by market in both Switzerland and the more recently launched United Arab Emirates offtake share has almost doubled since launch. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of scale and optimization should allow us to bring down the cost of ILUMA overtime starting in the second half of 2023.Focusing now on the European Union where smoke-free net revenue exceeded 40% of the region for the full year. Our fourth quarter HTU share increased by plus 2.4 points to reach 8.8% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume with a modest flattering effect from timing factor. IMS volumes continue to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 9.3 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects success across many markets and key cities including Vilnius with over 43% share, as well as Athens and Rome with over 25%. In Japan the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 35% of total tobacco with IQOS increasingly driving its growth In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.6 points to 24.5% with offtake share in Tokyo surpassing 30%.Our two-tier consumable portfolio continued to deliver strong results. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record-high of 8.8 billion units on a four-quarter moving average as the number of Japanese IQOS users crossed a remarkable 7.5 million adult consumers. In addition to strong IQOS gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income market. In 2022, our HTU shipments grew by almost 50% excluding Russia and Ukraine. This robust performance reflects success across many markets, including Egypt where Urban Cairo exit offtake share surpassed 7% Bulgaria and Malaysia where Q4 offtake share reached 14% in both capital cities. Let's now move on to Swedish Match which finished the year strongly further confirming our belief that this combination will be accretive to our growth and margin profile over the coming years.Please note for housekeeping purposes, that my comments on Swedish Match Financial Results are based on publicly available information through September 30th and from November 11th when it was consolidated in PMI's financial statements. Swedish Match delivered excellent performance following the acquisition, with strong net revenue and adjusted operating income. Most impressive was the phenomenal U.S. growth of ZYN which I will come back to on the next slide. In other U.S. smoke-free products, moist snuff also performed well gaining almost one percentage point share of segment and growing 2022 volumes within a declining category. In Scandinavia, the overall smoke-free market and Swedish Match continued to grow, albeit helped by year end trade inventory movements ahead of a January excise tax increase in Sweden.The cigar business delivered robust performance to end a challenging year with growth in volume and category share. We are very pleased with the strong 2022 results from Swedish Match, which also included positive pricing across all smoke-free category. We look forward to reporting our combined results going forward. Now let's discuss ZYN's recent U.S. performance in more detail. Excellent progress continues with shipment volume growth of plus 37% in 2022 and plus 35% in Q4, reaching a record quarterly high. ZYN category volume share grew sequentially by one percentage point compared to the third quarter and by 2.2 percentage points compared to the prior year, further strengthening its position as the clear number one nicotine pouch brand despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings.Importantly retail value share for ZYN remains strong at 75.7%, highlighting its premium positioning and high brand equity. 2023 promises to be a very exciting year. We are thrilled to have welcomed Swedish Match employee and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI, family to create a global smoke-free champion. And we will look we will work together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of the smoke-free future. In particular, bringing in ZYN and IQOS together in both the U.S. and international markets present a significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth and switching of adult smoker to better alternative. As a well-run and successful business we expect continued strong performance from Swedish Match existing operation.A key focus this year will be supporting and further driving strong in growth in the U.S. In addition, we are now preparing for the international expansion of nicotine pouches leveraging Swedish Match rich product portfolio and PMI's extensive smoke-free commercial infrastructure. In parallel, we will be actively Swedish Match U.S. distribution and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in 2024. Moving to sustainability. As we transform our company our business and sustainability strategies are advancing hand-to-hand with increasing momentum. PMI and Swedish Match have a shared vision and values. The combination helps us further accelerate towards achieving our purpose, transforming for good to make cigarettes obsolete and maximize the benefit of smoke-free products.Our goal for best in class ESG performance is aligned as we seek to address the environmental impact of our product, eradicate child labor, reduce our carbon footprint and provide a more inclusive and empowered working environment for all our employees. In December, we published a standalone report detailing our new biodiversity and water ambitions. For biodiversity we aim to achieve no low net loss on ecosystem connected to our value chain by 2033 and contribute towards to a net positive impact on nature by 2050. For Water Stewardship we aim to scale solutions towards a positive impact on water resources by 2033 and contribute towards a positive impact on water resources by 2050. I am also proud to share that for the third consecutive year we have been awarded CDP's Triple A.CDP scored nearly 15,000 companies on their climate change forest and water security disclosures, of which only 12 received this strategic prestigious score. In addition I am excited to share that we are included in the 2023 Bloomberg GenderEquality Index for the third year running. I'll now turn back to Jacek for concluding remarks.Jacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. Overall, our business delivered both a strong fourth quarter and full-year performance despite many challenging headwinds. We achieved excellent top and bottomline growth with double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and almost $6 of adjusted EPS for total PMI. The consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottomline delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last three years. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of IQOS, which is now complemented by the remarkable growth of ZYN. Combined with Swedish Match we will have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest-growing category of oral nicotine.We expect 2023 to be a landmark year for our smoke-free transformation with smoke-free net revenues of around $13.5 billion at constant currency, approaching 40% of our company. We have exciting opportunities for growing nicotine pouches in the U.S. and internationally, along with the U.S. commercialization of IQOS next year. We expect margin headwinds will persist in 2023 before improving in 2024. However, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with - and we look forward with confidence. With an excellent performance over the past two years and our strong 2023 outlook, we expect to comfortably exceed our three year minimum CAGR targets of more than 5% organic net revenue growth, more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and broadly stable shipment volumes.Finally, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business enables us to deleverage while maintaining our steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. Thank you for your attention, Emmanuel, and I will be happy now to answer your questions. See also Most Expensive Countries in Latin America and 25 Biggest Minnesota Companies.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Yes. He wishes he had done it sooner, apparently.“As the environment was growing more complicated in Q2 of last year, every bone in my body believed we should be much more aggressive in slowing hiring and reducing headcount,” Solomon said Sunday at a closed-door gathering with about 400 Goldman Sachs partners in Miami, according to the Financial Times.The bank saw net profits tumble by nearly half in 2022 compared to the year before. It's been scrambling to cut costs, with partner bonuses taking a hit and the use of private jets coming under scrutiny.On what came to be known internally as “David’s Demolition Day,” a large number employees were let go on Jan. 11. Some employees were fired after showing up for what they thought was a routine meeting, for which they had been emailed a calendar invite.Solomon reportedly said in Miami that the layoffs and cost-cutting would have been less severe had he acted sooner, and he took responsibility for not moving faster.Solomon has taken heat for living a glamorous life amid the bank’s woes, leading some Goldman Sachs insiders to question his focus on leading the company. In addition to hobnobbing with celebrities and taking private jets to the Bahamas, he’s known to DJ for live audiences as DJ D-SOL at clubs and events around the world.The board announced last month that Solomon’s pay for 2022 was $25 million. That was down 29% from 2021, but partners as a group saw their bonuses slashed in half.Some Goldman Sachs insiders are restive and have discussed who might replace Solomon, according to Insider. That hasn’t been helped The Economist running a cover story entitled ""The humbling of Goldman Sachs” a few weeks ago.Meanwhile many workers who were laid off last month received no bonus, a major chunk of employee pay at Goldman Sachs.“I was really looking forward to that bonus… That would have helped me with some of my expenses with school and things of that nature that I’m currently paying for,” a former analyst at Goldman’s Salt Lake City office told Fortune. “Everybody deserves to get their bonus.

You can skip our detailed analysis of recent developments in fusion energy and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Nuclear Fusion.Energy is the engine of the global economy and fossil fuels make up most of the energy supply. However, carbon emissions from fossil fuels have been wreaking havoc on the climate, pushing the world further into existential crisis. The world needs to transition to net zero emissions conservatively by 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Despite the hype around energy sources like wind, hydro and solar, they are not remotely energy-dense for the needs of a civilization of our economic scale, even as they’ve become more cost competitive. The fact that fossil fuels’ share in the global energy mix reduced by just 0.1% from 2009 to 2019 is a clear indication of this. Some stakeholders have pushed for nuclear fission, which is much more energy-dense than fossil fuels, as a viable and clean alternative. However, nuclear fission comes with problems of its own. For instance, fission energy costs an average of $150 per MegaWatt Hour (MWh), compared to $81 for gas power plants and $74 for coal-fired power plants, according to numbers from Bloomberg.In addition to cost, the nuclear fission is not exactly emissions-free when secondary emissions from uranium mining and refinement are accounted for. Moreover, the risks of accumulative radioactive waste, nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear meltdowns cannot be ignored.Why Fusion is The Holy Grail of Clean Energy?This brings us to nuclear fusion, which is much more cost competitive and energy-dense than nuclear fission, fossil fuels, as well as solar, hydro and wind energy.  For instance, inertial-confinement-fusion cost could be as low as $25 per MWh, according to research published in Philosophical Transactions of-the Royal Society journal.When it comes to energy density, nuclear fusion is four times more energy-dense than nuclear fission and almost four million times more dense than fossil fuels. Story continuesAnother advantage that fusion has over sources of energy like nuclear fission, coal, oil and gas is that it is orders of magnitude more sustainable, with no carbon emissions or toxic nuclear waste. Moreover, there is no resource-constraint on fusion’s reactants. Investment in fusion energy has seen a huge surge in recent years and real progress has been made in the field, with the most significant breakthrough coming in late 2022, as the National Ignition Facility successfully achieved a net positive gain of energy in a fusion reaction, a first in the history of fusion energy. Public-Private Investments in Fusion EnergyThe public and private investment in the fusion energy sector is rapidly growing, with private sector investment surpassing public funding for the first time in 2022. According to the Global Fusion Industry survey of 2022, public funding for the year stood at $4.7 billion, while private investments increased by 139% from 2021, reaching $4.8 billion.The sector has seen the emergence of eight new companies since the 2021 Global Fusion Industry survey, bringing the total number of fusion energy companies to 33, with six of them having raised more than $200 million.When it comes to the public sector, the US, EU, UK and Japan are heavily focusing on fusion. The EU accounts for 45% of the funding for the ITER project, and has decided to provide $6 billion for it for the period 2021-2027. Further, the EU is working with Japan on three Japan-based fusion projects aimed to complement the ITER.The noteworthy development in the US is that the country has decided to invest significantly in the private fusion sector, in line with the Bold Decadal Vision. The first major investment of $50 million was announced by the Department of Energy in September, 2022. The US invests roughly $0.7 billion every year on fusion energy research, and the money mostly goes to ITER, national labs and universities. This is the first major investment aimed towards the commercial development of fusion energy technology.In the private sphere, the US-based TAE Technologies is among the most notable startups, and has raised $1.2 billion to date. The development comes after the $250 million the company raised in the latest Series G round in mid-2022. Among the company's prominent investors are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been in partnership with TAE Technologies since 2014. However, the July, 2022 Series G round marked the first time Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has significantly invested in the startup.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), on the other hand, has invested in the company through its venture capital arm known as Chevron Technology Ventures. It is the first time Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has invested in the company.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) oversaw the advisory in relation to the Series G funding of the company. The company itself has been a prominent investor in TAE Technologies in the past. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was part of the Tae Technologies’ Series C-2 funding back in 2007. Photo by Dan Meyers on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list, we have defined ‘advanced countries in nuclear fusion’ as ones that have the highest number of fusion research projects as well as startups. For this purpose, we first ranked them based on the number of projects and then for the number of startups. We then calculated the average ranking for each country based on their two rankings in startups and research projects. For countries with the same averaged-out rankings, we’ve used their ranking in startups as the tiebreaker.For research projects, startups and their investors, we have sourced the data from Fusion Energy Base, a fusion energy database. For the latest funding rounds for startups, we’ve sourced data from Pitchbook. Here are the 10 most advanced countries in nuclear fusion. 10. AustraliaStartups Ranking: 3Research Projects Ranking: 9Average Ranking: 6Australia is the biggest economy in Oceania and is considerably advanced in energy technologies. The country has one fusion energy startup called HB11, based in Sydney. The company follows the laser-boron-fusion approach and its latest funds came from a grant of $6 million in late 2022, as per Pitchbook. Australia currently does not have publicly funded fusion research projects.9. RussiaStartups Ranking: 4Research Projects Ranking: 7Average Ranking: 5.5Russia is considered the nuclear superpower of the world, with the highest number of nuclear weapons. It is pertinent to mention that Russia has also made strides in nuclear fusion. The country has four fusion research projects, with three in Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics and one in Kurchatov Institute.Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics is most prominently known for projects like Globus-M2 and Gol-3, with the former being a spherical tokamak, and the latter having the mirror fusion approach. Russia does not have fusion energy startups as of 2023.8. ItalyStartups Ranking: 4Research Projects Ranking: 6Average Ranking: 5Italy’s fusion research projects make it one of the most advanced countries in nuclear fusion, despite it having no startups in the sector. The country has five research projects in two different institutes, with four of the projects being carried out at Consorzio RFX, using the reversed-field-pinch approach to fusion. Its FTU tokamak is operated at ENEA, or the Italian National Agency for new technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development.7. United KingdomStartups Ranking: 2Research Projects Ranking: 8Average Ranking: 5The UK is one of the leading countries in fusion energy. There are currently three fusion startups based in the UK, namely, First Light Fusion, Tokamak Energy and Fusion Reactors, with the first two being the most prominent. First Light Fusion uses the inertial-confinement-fusion approach. The company achieved fusion in April, 2022, as confirmed by the UK Atomic Energy Authority. The company achieved fusion using less than $54 million. According to Pitchbook, First Light Fusion has raised $480 million in later-stage venture capital, with the funding round still in progress.Tokamak Energy, on the other hand, has built several spherical tokamaks, with the latest prototype to be built at UKAEA’s Culham Campus. The UK is also one of the most advanced countries in nuclear fusion with regard to research projects in universities and labs, with three projects. Its Imperial College London and University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology are known for the projects MAGPIE and SPHEX Spheromak, respectively, while the UKAEA operates ZETA, a fusion reactor following the stabilized-pinch approach.6. FranceStartups Ranking: 3Research Projects Ranking: 5Average Ranking: 4France is known for the startup Renaissance Fusion, which has so far raised $16.1 million in the latest seed round, which concluded in late January, 26, 2023. Renaissance Fusion is developing stellarators that use high temperature superconductors.While France only has one startup in the fusion energy domain, it makes up for that with its six publicly funded research projects at institutes like Ecole Polytechnique and CEA.  Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Nuclear Fusion. Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Have Nuclear Weapons or Nuclear Power Technology18 Countries That Produce the Most Nuclear Energy15 Countries That Produce the Most Wind EnergyDisclosure: none. 10 Most Advanced Countries in Nuclear Fusion is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Now I will turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Winnie. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and calendar 2022 in what was an unprecedented year by nearly any measure with heightened worldwide macroeconomic uncertainties caused by persistent inflation, dramatically rising interest rates, significant foreign exchange volatility, a war in Europe and lingering impacts from the pandemic early in the period. Yet the consumer remained resilient throughout the year and we enabled a record over 64 billion transactions, culminating in a successful holiday season with multiple all-time high peak days. We delivered record results for 2022. While it's certainly in the New Year, internal metrics indicate more of the same. Where we have seen any discernible change, it is in some macro weakness in limited geographies like the United Kingdom and parts of Asia-Pacific.Having said that, those items already are reflected in our fourth quarter results and our guidance assumes no meaningful change in operating environments for 2023. We are pleased with our preliminary January results. For the fourth quarter, our Merchant business delivered 9% adjusted net revenue growth excluding dispositions and our Issuer segment achieved 5% adjusted net revenue growth, each on a foreign exchange neutral basis. Importantly, our core Issuer business again generated sequential financial and operating improvement, consistent with our expectations and the best performance since our merger with TSYS in 2019. For the full year, our performance was consistent with our September 2021 cycle guidance despite multiple black swan disruptions that emerged in 2022.Our Merchant business delivered 13% adjusted net revenue growth, excluding dispositions and our Issuer business generated 5% growth, each on a constant currency basis. For calendar 2022, we produced 10% total adjusted net revenue growth, again excluding dispositions, expanded margins by 200 basis points and generated 17% adjusted earnings per share growth on an FX-neutral basis, all right lined with our raised cycle guidance from 18 months ago despite all the incremental challenges of the macroeconomic environment. At our investor conference, we outlined our four-pillar strategy and focus on a simpler model more geared toward our corporate customers with enhanced growth and margin prospects. We detailed our capital allocation priorities that balance building the leading technology-enabled, software-driven payments business worldwide with efficient return of capital.And we highlighted our commitment to advancing our strategic partnerships with leading global technology companies, investors and share gaining financial institutions to further expand our competitive moat. We anticipate closing the acquisition of EVO Payments no later than the end of this quarter. With EVO, we have reinforced our position as a preeminent payments technology company with extensive scale and unmatched global reach. EVO enhances our target addressable markets, increases our leadership in integrated payments, expands our presence in new and provides further scale in existing geographies and augments our B2B software and payments solutions. We look forward to welcoming EVO's valued team members to the Global Payments family. We also remain on track to close the divestiture of Netspend's Consumer portfolio by the end of the current quarter, a key element of our strategic pivot.We believe that this transaction will best position Netspend's Consumer business for future success and we wish its team members the best of luck in the future. Additionally, we have reached an agreement to sell our Gaming Solutions business to Parthenon Capital Partners for $415 million. This transaction, much like the sale of Netspend B2C is consistent with our efforts to refine our portfolio toward our core corporate customers in a way from consumer-centric businesses. These three transactions further our strategic objectives, simplify our businesses and provide us with enhanced confidence in our growth and margin targets. We expect each of them to close by the end of March, providing us with core businesses from which to grow for many years to come.Our unique ability to provide differentiated vertical market software, payments and other technology solutions continues to resonate with customers. Our vertical market segment again delivered low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter with our QSR and School Solutions businesses, notable standouts. We are delighted to announce today that both the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Braves have chosen Global Payments to serve as their official commerce technology provider for State Farm Arena and Truist Park. The Hawks and the Braves ranked comprehensive RFPs to select their partner for the future. And they chose Global Payments because of our ability to deliver distinctive cloud-based software and payment solutions to create enhanced frictionless experiences that increase fan engagement, drive loyalty, provide cloud-based data and improve operational efficiency.We are proud to be the commerce technology partner for all of Georgia's major professional sports and entertainment venues. And our pipeline in this channel remains robust. In addition to the Hawks and the Braves takeaways, Xenial produced record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Recent wins also include A&amp;W Restaurants, Jack in the Box and Panda Express. What do these new customers all have in common such that they chose us in recent competitive takeaways? In short, consumer expectations for the sports and entertainment and QSR channels are high and the pace of technological change in those markets plays uniquely to our competitive strengths. Our technologies are winning everyday in the marketplace with more than 51,000 restaurants in over 65 countries choosing our purpose-built ecosystems to deliver positive experiences back to their customers.Other standouts in our Merchant business for the fourth quarter include our integrated and worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, which both again delivered mid-teens growth in the period. We are excited to combine the best of these businesses with EVO as our integration activities commenced in the near-term. In addition, we are now live with our acquiring relationship with Google across North America on the heels of the success of our initial launch in Asia-Pacific in 2021. Turning to our Issuer business, we produced the best performance we have experienced since the TSYS merger in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2022. We ended last year with a record 816 million traditional accounts on file, an increase of 15 million AOS sequentially, driven by double-digit account growth with industry-leading customers as our strategy of aligning with market share winners, shows gains.Our commercial card business continued to perform well, with transactions growing 20% in the fourth quarter as cross-border and domestic corporate travel continued its recovery trajectory. We lead in the issuer market with cutting-edge technologies, worldwide scale, terrific customer service and a partnership mentality. While the issuing business has always been and we expect will always remain highly competitive, those partners seeking to compete digitally know where they need to invest to be competitive in the marketplace. Much like in the Merchant business, issuing businesses in growth challenged markets without the wherewithal to make cloud-centric technology investments for the digital future will be increasingly challenged to compete.Thankfully, that's not our target market. We are very pleased to announce that TSYS signed a multiyear extension with Bank of America, one of our largest customers and relationship that spans consumer and commercial card portfolios in North America and the United Kingdom. We also extended our successful partnership with Deutsche Bank, our largest client in the DACH region into the next decade as TSYS remains their partner of choice for scheme branded card portfolios across international brands, including Deutsche Bank and Postbank, also good timing in light of our pending entry into the acquiring business in Germany through EVO. Other recent multiyear extensions with longstanding customers include P&amp;C for its commercial business. Our durable relationships with some of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally speak to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade.We currently have 9 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process. This includes a recent LOI for new business with TSYS in Mexico, well timed in relation to EVO and a competitive takeaway conducted via RFP. Another 12 of our recent LOIs, including 5 competitive takeaways, have gone to contract since the beginning of 2022, providing further future growth opportunities. We recently entered the Swedish market through a contract we executed with Entercard during the quarter spanning both its consumer and commercial portfolios. And we have got a contract with Scotia Chile portfolio, which is being added to our agreement with Scotiabank, a partnership that spans multiple markets across the Americas.Money, Dollar, FinancePhoto by alexander grey on UnsplashThis marks our second win in Chile, following the long-term agreement we reached with market leading retailer, Cencosud, signed earlier this year. Our issuer conversion pipeline stands at a record post-merger of over 75 million accounts, providing further confidence of our growth trajectory well into the future. We are pleased to report that we have now reached business agreement on ahead of terms with CaixaBank, one of the largest issuing institutions across Europe. Post implementation, we expect to become one of the largest debit technology providers in Europe. We are the beneficiaries of technological innovation, continued share shift and market share gains is just one example while we have been providing market-leading technologies for buy now, pay later initiatives for decades.We continue to innovate and deliver installment products as BNPL demand grows. This includes launching a successful BNPL program with one of our longstanding partners, NatWest, to aid customers with longer term purchases and special events. This product was designed to enable payments to be easily tracked and incorporates the robust fraud protections provided by FCA-regulated purchases. Other issuer highlights include a new partnership with Mastercard, leveraging Ethoca consumer clarity to improve the dispute resolution process and digital experiences for more than 25 million car owners in the U.S. and the UK. We also are collaborating with fintech software-as-a-service platform, Mondu, to provide next-generation capabilities for financial services customers across a number of strategic use cases, including credit cards BNPL, prepaid cards and a range of deposits and lending solutions.Finally, we have now combined the TSYS commercial card business, MineralTree and Netspend's B2B assets into a single unified B2B organization within the Issuer Solutions business as we focus on driving cross-selling opportunities. Across MineralTree and our core TSYS virtual card capabilities, total spend grew more than 50% in 2022 over the prior year as we remain focused on bringing the industry's best virtual card capabilities to our FIs, enabling B2B transactions, mobile wallet provisioning and online travel capabilities. MineralTree had a terrific fourth quarter of 2022 with growth in excess of 30%, and it is well positioned for gains heading into 2023. Josh?Josh Whipple: Thanks, Jeff. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which highlights the durability of our business model. Starting with the results for the full year 2022, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $8.09 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 10% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the full year improved 190 basis points to 43.7%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $9.32, an increase of 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the full year 2021, which includes the impact of the exit of our Russia business during the second quarter.These results were consistent with our guidance expectations and with our September 2021 cycle guidance from our investor conference despite all the challenges Jeff highlighted earlier. Moving to the fourth quarter results, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.02 billion, an increase of 4.4% from the same period in the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points to 44.4%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, an increase of 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period in 2021. Taking a closer look at performance by segment, Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.41 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting constant currency growth of 9% excluding dispositions.This performance was led by the ongoing strength of our U.S. and technology-enabled businesses. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.4% in the segment, an increase of 20 basis points year-on-year as we continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business mix. We saw double-digit growth across a number of our U.S. businesses in the quarter, including our integrated channel, vertical markets portfolio, POS solutions and HCM and payroll businesses, while our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses also delivered growth in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis this quarter. This strength was partially offset by ongoing headwinds from adverse foreign currency exchange rates along with macro softness in limited geographies like the UK and continued COVID-related restrictions in parts of Asia-Pacific.We are pleased with the fundamental performance of our Issuer Solutions business in the fourth quarter. Notably, core Issuer grew 5% this quarter, excluding the impact of FX, which was an 80 basis point acceleration sequentially and positions us well heading into 2023. As Jeff highlighted, traditional accounts on file increased by 15 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong account growth from our major consumer portfolio customers. Transactions also grew high single-digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 with strong contributions coming from commercial card transactions, which were up roughly 20% for the quarter. Our total Issuer business including B2B delivered $501 million in adjusted net revenue, also a 5% improvement on a constant currency basis for the same period in 2021.Excluding the impact of our PayCard business, which faced headwinds from both employment trends due to the macro environment and the lapping of pandemic subsidies, Issuer Solutions grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margins of 48.3%, an increase of 560 basis points from the prior year, fueled by our accelerated growth and focus on driving efficiencies in the business. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $723 million and $2.3 billion for the year, consistent with our target to convert roughly 100% of adjusted earnings into available cash, excluding the impact of the expired federal research and development tax credit. We invested $152 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and $616 million for the year in line with our expectations.Further, this quarter, we repurchased approximately 7.3 million of our shares for approximately $790 million. And for the full year, we repurchased 23.3 million shares for $2.9 billion or approximately 8% of our shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains healthy and our leverage position was 3.2x on a net debt basis at quarter end. We made further progress on our strategic priorities during the fourth quarter and remain on track to close our acquisition of EVO Payments and the divestiture of Netspend's Consumer assets by the end of the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we also reached an agreement to sell our Gaming business to Parthenon Capital Partners. We are pleased to have received HSR approval for this transaction and have submitted all other required regulatory filings.We also expect to close the Gaming Solutions divestiture by the end of this quarter. As a result, our business mix as of April 1 of this year will reflect our future state composition for three quarters of 2023 and beyond. We have ample financial flexibility, including our $5.75 billion revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn. And following the completion of all of these transactions, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 3.75x, below our prior estimates. We continue to expect to return to current leverage levels by year-end 2023 while maintaining existing investment-grade ratings. We are pleased with how our business is positioned as we enter 2023 and the resulting financial outlook for the year. We currently expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.575 billion to $8.675 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2022.We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. This is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement and the divestiture of Netspend, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization. To provide color at the segment level, we expect our Merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 15% to 16% for the full year. This includes growth of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of the acquisition of EVO Payments and dispositions. We expect the EVO Payments acquisition to contribute approximately $475 million of adjusted net revenue in calendar 2023, which assumes the transaction closes at the end of the current quarter.We expect more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion from the existing Global Payments Merchant business, excluding dispositions in 2023, ahead of our cycle guide. This expansion will be more than offset beginning in the second quarter with the absorption of the lower margin profile of EVO Payments. We expect this impact will be mitigated by synergy realization as the year progresses. As a result, we are forecasting margin expansion in Q1, contraction in the middle of the year and then margin expansion in Q4 as synergies ramp for our Merchant business. The net result will be a modest decline in our total Merchant business reported adjusted operating margin for the year. Moving to Issuer Solutions. We expect to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% range, including Netspend's B2B assets for the full year compared to 2022 as we benefit from our strongest conversion pipeline since the TSYS merger.Specifically, we expect core Issuer to grow roughly 5% and for MineralTree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to expand up to 60 basis points as we continue to benefit from operating leverage in the business as growth continues to accelerate, offset somewhat by faster growth in our lower-margin B2B businesses. Finally, while the disposition of our Consumer Solutions business is naturally expected to be a headwind for the full year, this transaction enhances the overall growth and adjusted operating margin profile of the business going forward. In terms of quarterly phasing, there are several items to note. First, while we expect foreign exchange rates to be roughly neutral for the full year, we anticipate the currency headwind to adjusted net revenue of up to 200 basis points in the first quarter and a headwind of up to 100 basis points in the second quarter.Second, we expect the timing of our EVO Payments acquisition and the dispositions of Netspend Consumer and Gaming to naturally impact quarterly growth rates during the year. We anticipate the impact of the disposition of the Netspend Consumer business to be offset for the most part by the addition of EVO, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter. Given the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures as well as foreign exchange rates, on our expectations for 2023, we have provided greater detail regarding our adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share assumptions for the year and by quarter in our slides posted today on our website. Moving to a couple of non-operating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be roughly $540 million and for adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5% for the full year.We also expect our capital expenditures to be around $630 million in 2023, consistent with our long-term targets. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to again be in a comparable range of 100% of adjusted earnings per share in 2023. For modeling purposes, we have assumed excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness in 2023 until we return to our current leverage levels towards the end of the year with minimal share repurchases until then. Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.37, reflecting growth of 10% to 11% over 2022. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth would have been 15% to 16% for 2023. Finally, we anticipate and assume a stable worldwide macro backdrop throughout the calendar year in 2023, reflecting the current environment.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Josh. I could not be more proud of all that we accomplished in 2022 despite the incremental challenges we faced throughout the year. These achievements have given us increased confidence in the accelerated growth trajectory we outlined at our investor conference. Simply put, we built a better, a more durable business model. Our expectations for 2023 are for a return to normalcy with businesses across our markets delivering a typical financial and operating levels. The consumer remains resilient with anticipated spending patterns reflected in our recent results and our guidance. The imminent closing of the acquisition of EVO and the sales of Netspend B2C and Gaming mean that three quarters of calendar 2023 will reflect results of the businesses that we intend to manage well into the future. We've completed the strategic pivot set forth in September 2021, and we are very much the better for it. Winnie?Winnie Smith: Thanks, Jeff. Thank you. We will now go to questions.See also 16 Most Valuable Beverage Brands in the World and Lithium Battery Production by Country.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.Darrin Peller: Guys, thanks. Nice results. But look, just still a lot of moving parts. So Jeff, my first question would just be if you can help us understand, when you look past all these  the Gaming divestiture, the EVO deal, in the Merchant business, number one, I guess, if you can give us a sense of what the  some of the main moving parts were in the quarter again in terms of the  some of the verticals you're operating in, in the software-centric businesses, the tech-enabled areas, a little bit more granularity. But more importantly, when you look beyond this, what is this growth profile of this business, again, including EVO, including the divestiture of Gaming? And how do we think about Merchant going forward for the next year or 2?Jeff Sloan: Darrin, it's Jeff. I'll start, and I'll ask Cameron to jump in, too. So I think we've described that over the last number of calls. We're going to end up with  in the aggregate, if you step back, a Merchant business is three quarters of the revenue of the company and an Issuer in B2B business that's 25% of the revenue of the company. That's reflected in our September 21 cycle guidance expectations, and if anything, makes us feel better about achieving those expectations. That was covered in our press release in our prepared remarks this morning where, excluding dispositions on an FX-neutral basis, we actually hit those targets despite all the incremental challenges and uncertainties in a lot of the markets that we're in.I'd also say that we expect all the transactions that we've announced previously and now Gaming today that closed by the end of this quarter, So three quarters of 2023, as I said in my prepared remarks, I expect to reflect the businesses that we will have for many years in the future and the future to come. I also touched on  I'll turn to Cameron in a second, but I also touched on some of the pieces that have generated fantastic growth, the 9% that we announced this morning in Merchant, the 13% for the year, 9% for the quarter, the 9% volume growth I announced in my prepared remarks. Some of the pieces that added into that namely our integrated business, which again grew into the mid-teens, our e-comm and omni businesses. which again grew into the mid-teens meaningfully in excess of the Visa, Mastercard kind of e-com reporting, and of course, meaningfully in excess of what PayPal announced last night in terms of their volumes and the like.So I think those growth drivers that we've described historically at our last investor conference in probably the last 4 or 5 years of calls in our Merchant business, I expect to continue to drive the business forward. Cameron, do you want to provide more detail on merchant to take it?Cameron Bready: Yes, Darrin, I'm happy to. Maybe I'll start with the quarter and then I'll spend a little bit of time on the outlook as well. So for the quarter, as Jeff highlighted, I think we're pretty pleased with the overall growth we saw in the business. Obviously, that was led by the U.S. business, which again produced double-digit growth in the quarter. Jeff highlighted a couple of, I think, the outstanding businesses from a performance perspective. But I'd also note, our point-of-sale, ATM and payroll businesses also grew in the double digits. Our vertical market business grew in the double digits. So our U.S. business overall was double digits for the quarter. North America in total, including Canada, was right at 10%, exactly what we did in Q3.So again, I think good strength across kind of the U.S. and North American businesses. Where we saw a little bit of headwind was from our Asian and European businesses. We do see some macro headwinds in the UK. I think we talked about that in our prepared remarks. And Asia continues to be impacted by COVID-related restrictions, although as we get early into 2023, we're starting to see those lift, and January results obviously reflect a lifting of those restrictions, which is encouraging to see heading into the year. So really, our performance in Q4 was largely the same as Q3, but for international businesses. They were a point of tailwind in Q3, and there were a point of headwind in Q4. I think when you look at the business overall, fundamentally, 9% constant currency volume growth, I think, compares very favorably against what you saw from Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Fiserv.So I think we feel very good about the momentum and the underlying fundamental performance of the Merchant business as we head into 2023. As we talked about this morning, our highlights for 2023 from a growth perspective start with Global Payments sort of core business at 9% to 10%, again, relatively consistent with the cycle guidance that we provided for that business reflecting a macro environment that we expect to be largely consistent with kind of what we've seen exiting 2022. So fundamentally, I think we feel really good about how the business is performing and the component parts in the technology-enabled aspects of the business that we expect to drive growth are continuing to do just that.Jeff Sloan: Yes. And we see that trend, as I said, just to finish off on that point from Cameron, Darrin. As I said in the prepared remarks, we saw the same trends continue into January. So really with the preliminary results that we have for January, we are pleased with the metrics that we have into January and into February. So we really haven't seen  as Cameron just alluded to, really haven't seen much of a change. Bank of America came out this morning with some comments about a healthy consumer. So we continue to be pleased with where we are.Darrin Peller: That's great, that's great. One quick follow-up on the Issuer side. You obviously have  you showed the acceleration we hoped for, for the fourth quarter, which is great. Think you have 75 million accounts on file that are scheduled to be able to come on over the course of the year and more maybe in 24 with Caixa, if I remember correctly. And so just thinking about the guidance for Issuer, it seems like it's roughly  I think it was 4.5% to 5.5%, if I'm not mistaken. Between all the tailwinds, could it have been a little higher? Is that conservative? Can you just touch on that? Thanks, guys.Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Darrin. Yes. So look, I think we're really pleased with where the Issuer business is, and it's really issuer and B2B now. So look, I would tell you that in the back half of calendar 2022, for Issuer in particular, we exceeded our expectations almost every month and certainly for the two quarters. So we've got our fingers crossed that we will do better and what that it will accelerate further. As I mentioned a minute ago, the metrics to January  preliminary results in January and metrics and issuance of February also look very healthy. So look, we're hopeful we can do better than that. I would say though that the fourth quarter of 22 itself represented 80 basis points of sequential acceleration in core Issuer just from Q3, Darrin, into Q4 sequentially in terms of revenue.So look, I'm hopeful we can all look back and say that was a low bar, but you're talking about a business that had its best performance in the month of December that adds since the merger expect performance in the quarter that it had since the merger, Darrin, be delighted to talk to you in May about how good the performance is in the first quarter if that will continue. But I think we've got multiple tailwinds in that business. We're really excited about where it is. Obviously, part of our goal is to get B2B larger. So as Josh said in his prepared remarks, B2BX Paycard added about 60, 70 basis points to the growth rate. We'd obviously like to get that bigger and that's part of our plan to get to mid to high over time single-digits in that business, but that's reflected in our guide today, up to 5.5% growth.So I think we've got every avenue of opportunity available to continue to build on the sequential acceleration that we saw in calendar 2022. And hopefully, Darrin, can look back later in the year and laugh about how easy it was.Darrin Peller: Alright. It's great to hear. Thanks, guys.Jeff Sloan: Thanks, Darrin.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.James Faucette: Great. Thanks. I wanted to touch quickly on the expense side and expectations for margin expansion. I wonder if you can just give a little more detail there, particularly around like labor. And just wondering if wage pressures have largely subsided at this point? And is that part of what you're expecting to help contribute to margin expansion?Jeff Sloan: Yes, James, it's Jeff. I'll start and I'll ask Josh to jump in too kind of at a macro level. I wanted to give you a little bit more of the micro detail. So look, our job is to manage the business. Wage inflation, rent inflation, that's part of the operating company. Our job is not to blame that for misses. Our job is to absorb that and move on. And I think that's what we've been able to do, not just in the fourth quarter or the guide but over the last number of years. I certainly would say, just speaking for us, that the employment market has changed. I would say, as you've seen the tech layoffs come from other folks around the country and around the world, there is no doubt there is been a change in perspective.I wouldn't say though that's changed the wage inflation expectations of people in our company or in the market, more broadly valued team members our value team members. And we need to be and we are market competitive. The last time I looked, which admittedly, James was probably a little bit ago, I think headcount and tech in our company was up 10% versus 19, and comp was up similarly or even a little bit more. As I mentioned a minute ago, our job is to manage those numbers, absorb them and still move on, which is kind of what we've done. So, ongoing wage inflation is reflected in our expectations for margin expansion this year. It was reflected in our actual results for margin expansion last year. And obviously, we offset that with good growth, we offset it with leverage and everything else.Josh, you want to be more specific on some of the margin stuff?Josh Whipple: Yes, absolutely. So James, as I said in my prepared remarks that we expect margins to expand approximately 120 basis points in 2023, which is if you think about our cycle guide at 50 to 75 basis points, that is ahead of our cycle guide. And we expect to see outsized margin expansion in Q1 of approximately 200 basis points, which is similar to the levels that we saw in Q4, and then we expect to see more normalized expansion of 100 basis points to the balance of the year. And I would say that the primary driver of the benefits of this margin expansion is really a business mix shift towards technology enablement and the divestiture of Netspend, which we had talked about, which we expect to be partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO before we start to go ahead and realize synergies. So that's a little bit more color as it relates to margin outlook for 2023.James Faucette: Really appreciate that. And then you guys are obviously basing your outlook on kind of relatively stable macro environment. I guess I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't try to pressure test that a little bit. If we look at some of the segments, whether  in your exposure, whether it be the SMB and e-commerce, I've heard kind of mixed feedback recently from other companies in the space. Can you just give a little bit of insight into what you're seeing in SMB? Are you seeing points of weakness, etcetera, similarly on e-commerce? Thanks.Jeff Sloan: Yes. I'll start, James, and then I'll ask Cameron to give more detail. So I would just say, as we said in our prepared remarks, look, the fourth quarter and Cameron said this, in certain of our markets, United Kingdom, Asia Pacific, they moved from a tailwind to a headwind. And I think a lot of that is macroeconomic-related. Some of that obviously is COVID, as Cameron alluded to, kind of coming in and out. I mentioned before that January preliminary results are favorable and that we see those metrics kind of trending and continuing, so that doesn't appear shifted from the fourth quarter. But the point I was trying to make in my prepared remarks, James, is whatever macro disruption we've kind of seen from higher rates, FX, COVID, whatever you want to call it, UK, already in our results from the fourth quarter and certainly our annual results from January and guide our expectations.So I would say that's kind of early in the cake, so to speak, as we think about kind of where we are. Cameron, you want to be a little bit more detailed on SMB and mix?Cameron Bready: Yes, I'm happy to. I mean I think what we're seeing right now is relative stability across the SMB markets that we target in our vertical market businesses and our Merchant business overall. And the best example I can probably provide is just where we stand as it relates to booking and new sales trends kind of exiting 2022, heading into 2023 because I think that's a good barometer as to where we see the health of that overall market. Believe it or not, we had our best sales month of the year in our U.S. Merchant business in December. And it was our second best all time. So I think from that perspective, we're seeing very good momentum across new sales, which I think is a good  obviously, a good canary in the coal mine for what we anticipate in 2023.We had a record payroll sales month in December, and we continue to see near 20% bookings growth in our vertical market businesses, again, all targeted largely towards the SMB segments of the market here in the U.S., by and large. E-comm and omni continues to produce really good results. As we highlighted on the call, mid-teens growth again yet this quarter, we continue to benefit, I think from digitization trends that obviously help blend the physical and virtual world. But I think again, we are uniquely positioned to solve this complexity for our merchant customers, and we see great adoption of those capabilities from our merchants in virtually all markets around the globe in which we are operating today. So, look, I think we are fairly confident as we head into 2023 to the guide that we provided today.Obviously, macro can evolve over the course of the year. I don't think we are assuming perfect macro. We didn't see perfect macro in Q4, as Jeff highlighted. So, I think some of that is obviously reflected in the guide today. I think the guide doesn't assume it gets meaningfully worse nor does it assume it gets meaningfully better from where we are. And I think again, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on the results that we forecasted in our call earlier this morning.James Faucette: Thanks everybody.Jeff Sloan: Thanks James.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Jason Kupferberg: Good morning guys. Thanks. So, we are talking about 9% to 10% organic growth in merchant, 4.5% to 5.5% in issuer. I just wonder if I try to understand Slide 10, where you pulled together some of the pieces here. I see the divestiture adjustment there, but I don't see anything explicitly talking about the EVO acquisition. So, you showed 8% to 9% here. So, that, I guess is essentially the organic overall? I don't know, I am still confused that we don't see the adjustment for EVO?Jeff Sloan: Yes. Jason, it's Jeff. So, I will start. So, we will start with our GAAP guide, which is the first row, and then we have got our normal GAAP adjustments, which is the second row, the home adjustments to get adjusted net revenue. That's what we report, the 6% to 7%. We said currency was roughly neutral. The truth is it's a 20 basis point headwind. We are just going to absorb that. We didn't think calling that out and trying to back out 20 basis points based on what we know is really worth anyone's time. Our job is to manage those things. The reason we call it net divestiture, if that's net of EVO. So, as I mentioned a minute ago, Netspend B2C and EVO are roughly similar in size. They are going to close, our expectation, is on around the same day.So, there is no timing discontinuity of those things. Those offset more or less, I would say there is a little bit of leakage. So, there might be something like 50 basis points, 60 basis points of leakage on the sale of Netspend Consumer relative to the acquisition of EVO. But then remember, we were forced to exit the Russia business April 29th, Jason, of last year, so we have overlap there for a period. And then we obviously also announced today from a revenue point the sale of gaming, which is earnings-neutral, but obviously revenue-dilutive. So, the net effect of that is minus 1.7%. If you get the lot together, the acquisition of EVO, the sale of Netspend Consumer, the forced divestiture of Russia, the sale of gaming does net to minus 1.7%.So, if you add back currency and get back the net effect, which is why it says net there on Slide 10, you get to the 8% to 9%, which to your point, and we call it core here. That's our view of what the core business is really doing. If you want to take that to earnings, and Josh actually put this in his quote in press release. If you back out the divestiture because it's not our  our cycle guide doesn't include divestitures. If you back that out, core earnings growth would have been 15% to 16%. That's not what we were guiding to, because that's not what we are going to report. But the 8% to 9% correlates to the 15% to 16%. Then if you say, well, what about EVO's run rate of expense synergies because we only get 1 point or 2 points of accretion this year because we only own it for nine-twelfth of the year.But if you look at our guide from August 1st, there is another 3% of accretion to EPS at full run rate  incremental free at full run rate phase in full expense synergies, which is from August 1st of last year. You put that in, and we are actually at 17% to 20% earnings guide. So, the way we think about it, Jason, is 8% to 9% is the run rate of what the quarter is doing. We are not guiding to that because we are going to report which is what Pages 7, 8, 9 do, what our press release does. We don't want to have any confusion. But for those who are interested in what's really going on, what's the core revenue growth rate of the company, whatever it is, it's 8% to 9%. What's the core earnings growth of your company, it's 15% to 16% and with full phase in EVO synergies, it's 17% to 20%.So, right on top again  and Josh already said, it's 120 on the margin, so right on top again of our cycle guide despite all the uncertainties of the world.Jason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. And then just as a follow-up, I know the primary use of balance sheet this year is to pay down debt, but do you potentially see room to do deals if something particularly interesting pops up? And then just a quick housekeeping thing, can you just clarify how much interest income benefit you expect this year from the solid financing on the Netspend side? Thanks guys.Josh Whipple: Yes, absolutely. So, our primary focus this year is to go ahead and pay down debt. And so we are currently 3.25x levered. Today, with the  once we close, EVO will be about 3.75x levered. And then we will focus on paying down debt for the balance of the year, and we expect to get back to our current leverage levels at the end of the year. If you think about interest income, it's approximately $75 million for the year.Jason Kupferberg: Thanks.Jeff Sloan: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Bryan Keane: Hi guys. Good morning and congrats on the solid results. Jeff, I wanted to ask about yields. A lot of chatter on looking at the merchant side. If you look at your volumes, they look very favorably versus peers. On yields, you guys are about flat. Others are showing large increases. Can you just give some comments on how you think about yields and yields going forward in the merchant business?Cameron Bready: Yes. Bryan, it's Cameron. Maybe I will jump in, and I will ask Jeff to add any other additional comments if he would like to. So, look, I would just say our philosophy around pricing really hasn't changed very much. We do want to ensure we are getting paid fairly and appropriately for the level of service and capabilities we are providing to our customers and our pricing strategies, I will say, are generally aligned with this. We are not really positioning ourselves to be the low-cost provider in the market. I think we are price competitive. But obviously, we strive to differentiate ourselves based on our capabilities and the service that we deliver to the customers that we have the benefit of serving in the marketplace.So, like everybody else, as we talked about earlier on this call, I mean we have inflationary pressures that we have to absorb around wage, goods, services, etcetera. Obviously, we have reflected that in pricing plans kind of accordingly. But I would say, to your point, our volume growth continues to track relatively consistently with our overall revenue growth. And our spreads have remained relatively consistent. I would say, over time, we continue to expect to see spreads overall increase as we continue to pivot towards more technology enablement in the business, as we continue to scale our point-of-sale business, our vertical market businesses continue to grow, e-comm and omni continues to be a tailwind for the growth. All those businesses generally have higher spreads because we are selling more technology, obviously, than sort of traditional merchant acquiring in general.So, I think there is a lot of tailwinds around our spreads as we move forward in time. But we have been fairly I would say, sanguine as it relates to our pricing strategies as we have been able to generate good revenue growth in the business on the back of really solid fundamental volume growth across the globe.Bryan Keane: Got it. Great. And just on some of the renewals, the larger renewals. I guess the worry always is on a renewal basis, you will have to take significant kind of discounts to renew those businesses in a competitive environment. Jeff or Cameron, obviously, could you just talk a little bit about the renewal cycle because it sounded like with BofA and others, you have signed quite a bit of business, just thinking about pricing there. Thanks.Jeff Sloan: Yes. Thanks Bryan. I think what you said is accurate. So, look, BofA is one of our largest customers. They just renewed for a multiyear period. That renewal started January 1st, this year and it's in our guidance, right. So, our 5% at the midpoint, 4.5% to 5.5% on the page reflects all that. So, we are growing, and I would say generally growing right through those things. So, I think that really hasn't changed. What has changed in the issuer business, right, somewhat Cameron described, I think in response to Jason's comment is we are leading with technology, right. So, if it's not  most of the RFPs we get now are cloud centric. And I think if you don't have a cloud-centric cloud-native solution, then I don't think all the pricing in the world is not really going to move the needle there.So, we think that's what we announced today with BofA, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Post. Deutsche Post, that was a takeaway in Europe, double the size  it doubles the size of our business in Germany. Well timed with EVO, which obviously that closing is imminent, but they are in Germany on the acquiring side. And of course, we announced I think TSYS is already in Mexico, but probably our biggest new customer in Mexico and LOI. That was the competitive takeaway from one of our peers. We are very excited about that too. Those are RFPs, those are all competitive takeaways. So, you have to be competitive on price. But I would say leading technology in the issuer business has become table stakes. So, if you are not cloud-centric, you have a partner like we do in AWS, I think it's very difficult to compete.So, I think the answer to your question at the end of the day, Bryan, is, yes, BofA, P&amp;C, all these other things is Citi renewal from a year ago on the commercial side, the recent win in Mexico and everything else we are seeing is in the fact that we accelerated 80 basis points sequentially in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And our expectation is for more growth and more acceleration in 2023. And the way our math works and issuer is the way it's worked forever. In the merchant business, if you give an x percent discount over a 5-year term, you are pretty much with volume growth surpassed that within the first 18 months of doing it in the first place. And that's been our experience in merchant, predates me and can go back 30 years.So, maybe it's  I can't speak in the 70s and 80s that predates me and merchant. And certainly, that's been my experience on the issuer side. Cameron, do you want to comment on merchant?Cameron Bready: No, the only thing I was going to add to that, Bryan, as it relates to renewals and issuer. It's a little bit like the merchant business and that we are not trying to be all things to all people. We target very specific segments of the market, and we are really targeting winners in the market. Those issuers who are growing, they are acquiring more portfolios, they see good organic growth from a card deployment perspective in their business today. So, you can afford to give, to some degree, those discounts on renewals because you are going to grow through them over a short period of time, to Jeff's point. So, it speaks to a little bit around how we position the issuer business in the marketplace, the target market for us from a growth perspective. And again, the organizations we like to partner with, those that are winning in the marketplace and give us the opportunity to grow through any sort of discount we may have to provide on a renewal over time.Jeff Sloan: Look, it sounds like the Braves, the Hawks, the Falcons, stuff we announced today, with the states, like those are all RFPs, too. Those are RFPs with the existing providers. Those are RFPs with new fintech entrants. We are winning those too. Some of those guys know how to run RFPs at the NFL, the NBA, MLS right, etcetera. So, I would say what we are leading with is technology and that's not cells. If you don't care about the quality of tech and the quality of the service that quality support, as Cameron said, you would probably go look elsewhere.Bryan Keane: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks guys.Jeff Sloan: Thanks Bryan.Cameron Bready: Thanks Bryan.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW. Please proceed with your question.Vasu Govil: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is just on the macro and the EVO business. I guess could you talk a little bit about the defensiveness of the book of business that you are acquiring with EVO? And to the extent macro does slowdown, how would your outlook on the accretion change there, if at all?Cameron Bready: Vasu, it's Cameron. I will start and I will ask Jeff to jump in. I think what we like about the EVO portfolio overall is their exposure to faster growth markets around the globe. So, obviously, I think EVO, part of the strategy that they have pursued and it's one that's consistent with us is to have those exposures to geographies with strong secular growth trends. Obviously, where we see good favorable macro environment as it relates to card adoption, in digitization of payments over time, notwithstanding what the underlying macro environment in those markets may be. So, I think we feel, obviously, that our guide for EVO today  that we provided today, which is around $475 million for 2023 for three quarters of the year, which run rates to about 630, 635, something like that.Obviously, I think it reflects a pretty consistent view of the macro environment globally that we have here at Global Payments, but obviously does, to some degree, benefit from the fact that they are in secular growth markets. That obviously create tailwinds and good opportunities for us to continue to grow over longer periods of time. So, yes, you may see a little bit of macro softness in some of these markets. But again, the strong underlying secular growth trends more than offset that and I think as leave us well positioned to see good growth in EVO business year-over-year, apples-to-apples for 2023 as well as kind of the years beyond.Jeff Sloan: Yes. I mean at that point, Vasu, as Josh in his prepared remarks, that 430ish, 435 number, which is like 630, whatever the math is, for the full year reflects double-digit growth over EVO period-over-period. So, that's the number ready. Then on your earnings question, what we showed today was consistent with what we said on August 1st is really no change. That 1% to 2% of accretion for nine-twelfth of the year for EVO, if you fully phased in, as I said, as a response I think to James' question, you fully phased in the synergies for EVO. You would get to 4% to 5%, which basically offsets completely the Netspend B2C Consumer disposition. That's what we guided to in August 1st of 22. Vasu, we said, nothing has changed.Vasu Govil: Thank you very much. And just my quick follow-up was on issuer. I know you got a lot of questions on that already. But just high level, if you think about what's your medium-term guide or cycle guide for that business was sort of in the mid-single digits. And it seems we are trending towards the low end now for a couple of years. Can you help us think visit the commercial portfolio that's still weighing on it or something beyond that? And is this sort of a more sustainable growth rate going forward?Jeff Sloan: Yes. I will take that Vasu and Josh can jump in. So, look, our cycle guide for that business has been, I think TSYS was 2%, 4% to 6%. The good news is in our guide, we go up to 5.5%, right, today. So, we have 4.5% to 5.5%. Obviously, 5% in the midpoint, 5% is the midpoint of 4% to 6% also. But notice the 4.5% to 5.5% relative to the 4% to 6% historical cycle guide. So, I think that's good news. I think the difference in that business is really twofold. One, as I mentioned in response to Bryan's question, I think the cloud-centricity and the advent of new technology business, look, we wouldn't have won the deal in Mexico. I don't think we would have won  I know we would have won CaixaBank and the other things we described, if we weren't cloud-centric and cloud native in that business, which is obviously what we have been working on since our announcement in August of 2020 with AWS.So, the first thing I think it's changed is what people are buying, which is really technology and look, price is always an issue, but I think as I mentioned a minute ago and Cameron too, I think we are always price competitive. That's kind of point number one. Point number two, obviously, is the mix with B2B assets that we made the pivot on with MineralTree in September of 2021 and now with elements of Netspend B2B. And I think what we said in the back half of last year, Vasu, is that should over time, and now I am talking about including B2B, right, that's kind of a new item. That takes you from the 4% to 6% and it's going to take you higher to this x as B2B becomes a bigger point. As I think Josh said in his prepared remarks today, excluding Paycard, which is more macro sensitive and had lot of COVID subsidies in it.For employment, if you back that out, B2B added 60 bps to the core. So, if the quarter is growing 5%, I think we just said it was growing 5% in the fourth quarter. If the quarter is growing 5% and you are adding 60 bps, now you are close to 6%. And as those mixes change and as we burn through the pipeline, you are going to get to that mid to mid to high, which obviously is an enhancement with B2B over the traditional 4% to 6%. So, the high end of our guide right now is 5.5%. That's higher than 5%. We hope, obviously, that continues over time. But the business is in a very healthy place. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had record after record during the peak in particular, in our issuer business. And I don't see any signs currently of our expectations changing.Vasu Govil: Great. Thank you for the color. That was very helpful.Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question this morning will come from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Will Nance: Hey guys. I appreciate you taking the question. Jeff, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the earlier question on kind of the run rate growth as you guys are exiting in the year. I mean, I am kind of looking at Slide 9 at the 7% to 8% growth or on a segment basis kind of 9% to 10% standalone GPN and/or standalone merchant and mid-single digits on issuer. I guess just how do you kind of bridge what the sum product of those two growth rates gets you towards sort of the low-double digit cycle guide on top line? And kind of what needs to improve from here to kind of get to those numbers? Thanks.Jeff Sloan: Yes. So, what I would say is our cycle guide, I would like to start with that Will and just work in reverse. So, our cycle guide of low-double digits includes M&amp;A in it. For example, on the revenue side as well as the expense side, capital deployment has always been a part. And what we have said historically, Will, even before 21, probably going back to 15, 18, is that M&amp;A, for example, can add up to a couple of hundred basis points of revenue in any given period. And capital deployment generally gets 2 to 3 points kind of earnings growth and has historically for a company, whether it's buybacks or M&amp;A or anything else. So, that's the overall generality. Then if you go to your question, on Pages 9 and 10.So, what we are trying to get at is we only have three quarters of EVO in 2023. Obviously, we have a disposition coming in 2023, where our cycle guide doesn't assume we are selling 10% of the revenue of the company, which is what's in the disposition. So, we tried to back that out to give you a better sense of the 8% to 9%. And then obviously, the exit period also has a currency assumption, as I mentioned a minute ago, and there is a bit of a currency headwind over the year. So, I think the answer to your question is as we accelerate merger integration with EVO, we expect to see revenue acceleration, 125, Will, is just an expense number. So, as we integrate EVO towards the end of the year, as we look at revenue opportunities when it closes beyond expense opportunities, if you add those 1 to 2 points, which is back to our cycle guide over the last number of cycles, you are exiting the year at 8% to 9% on Page 9.Obviously, it's a bit of a currency thing there, 7% to 8%, add 1 to 2 points, just on EVO alone, and you are going to get to double digits of revenue. I mentioned a minute ago in response to Jason's question that on earnings ex dispositions this year were 15% to 16%, and EVO were 17% to 19%. So, I think we are kind of at the earnings number with a full year effect of EVO ex the disposition. And I think we are within sharing distance on the revenue side. Then lastly, I would say, we kind of alluded to this in the investor conference, the shifting business mix on the issuer business towards more B2B, I just mentioned a minute ago in response to Vasu's question, our 4.5% to 5.5% of 5% in the middle, I think it's right in line with what we said historically.But obviously, that 5.5% is towards the high end of 6%. So, it's still like we would have said 4% to 6%, like here it is 5.5%. And obviously, it was a lower number in 21 and for most of 22 to end up the year at 5%. As that mix continues to shift, we see another 50 basis points, 60 basis points coming from B2B as the wins continue to roll in from things like CaixaBank, etcetera. That business should accelerate. Now, you are on top of 10% to 11%, which is our cycle guide with M&amp;A in it. So, I think Will, exiting this year, we are kind of right on track to be where we would like to be from a cycle guide point of view. I would also say, as we said both in the press release and our prepared remarks today, we hit the sight for calendar 22, let's not lose sight of that, constant currency neutral and ex dispositions.So, I think we are right, we are at we want to be despite all the uncertainties in the current macro environment.Will Nance: Got it. Appreciate all the detail there. So, I guess that's M&amp;A mix shift towards B2B and maybe some core acceleration in the issuer business, that's very helpful. I appreciate all the details on the slide deck, by the way, very clear. I have a very quick follow-up. On the gaming business, could you just provide any details on the contribution of that business to 2022 results, just so we have a clean number there?Cameron Bready: Yes. I can give you a little bit of color there, Will. It's Cameron. The gaming business got about $100 million a year or so. And I think we sold that business at around kind of an 8x multiple level, 7.5x, 8x. Can give you a sense of sort of the EBITDA contribution that it would deliver. So, as we look at 2023, we will have one-quarter of the business, so about $25 million of revenue. You can see that highlighted on Page 9 of our disclosures today. And then we will lose about $75-ish million plus of revenue kind of relative to what we had in 2022 from that business.Will Nance: Got it. Very helpful. Appreciate you taking the questions guys.Jeff Sloan: Thanks Will.Cameron Bready: Thanks will.Jeff Sloan: Well, on behalf of Global Payments, thank you very much for joining us this morning. Have a great day.Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

You can skip our detailed and historical performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Retirement. Millions of American households are behindhand when it comes to retirement planning. According to a study conducted by Northwestern Mutual, Americans expect that they need approximately $1.25 million to retire comfortably. This figure shows a 20% growth from the $1.05 million recorded in 2021. Another data from Natixis Investment Managers shows that 58% of the high net worth individuals mentioned that they’ll have to extend their working years instead of retiring at the age of 63.Retirees around the world search for ways to increase their earnings through investments as inflation notched its highest mark in nearly 40 years. In this regard, the Social Security Administration provided relief to retirees with the announcement of increasing benefits by 8.7% this year to weather this inflationary environment, as reported by Bloomberg. Through this increase, the average retiree benefit has grown to $1,827 per month, up $146 from the last year. However, with average annual household expenses for ages 65-74 of approximately $53,000, these social security benefits are not sufficient to cover living expenses smoothly. For this purpose, retiree investors are showing a renewed interest in the stock market, loading up steadily on dividend stocks.Historical analysis of dividend stocks shows that these securities generated stable returns for shareholders over the years. According to a paper published by Jefferson Research, dividend stocks accounted for 85% of the market’s total returns from 1926 to 2010. The paper also cited Goldman Sachs’ 2013 report which mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 9.6% through this period with a 16.2% volatility. Whereas, the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.1% with a volatility of 18%.Story continuesStocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are popular among retiree investors as these companies have solid free cash flow generation and hold long dividend growth track records.

(NYSE:JEF) is a New York-based multinational independent investment bank that provides related financial services to its consumers. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.07%, as of February 9.

(NYSE:JEF) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor, and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”29. Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)24. Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Bad debt expense is likely to rise from the unusually low levels we’ve been experiencing, but we believe the company is well-positioned to absorb this normalization.

To skip our detailed analysis of inflation-resistant companies and sectors, you can go directly to see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.The worst economic recession recession recorded in recent history was the 2008 global financial crisis. The crisis began within the US housing market, with home prices rising rapidly in the late 1990s and exceeding income growth by 2000. This created a housing bubble consisting of record-breaking prices for housing in the US, which eventually burst and led to a market collapse for subprime mortgages. In the aftermath, the whole world was forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, with the after-effects of the crisis leaking into the global economy. By analysing the market in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, and later with additional market research post-COVID-19, financial researchers and analysts have managed to pinpoint several industries that fare well during an economic downturn.As a result, companies operating within these industries like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are often considered to be money-makers in times of recession. According to McKinsey report published in 2009, recession-resistant industries include consumer staples, healthcare, telecommunication services, and utilities, among more. In 2008, the total returns to shareholders fell for all sectors by over 20%, but consumer staples was an exception to this.A look at the utilities industry, another traditional recession-proof sector, clarified that companies operating in this area were also able to perform much better than others. KPMG's report on European power and utilities, published in 2021, showed that the deal value of the European power and utilities sector rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021. This came about as a result of higher power prices in the aftermath of the COVID-19 economic downturn. Another example of a fairly recession-resistant industry is the healthcare sector. Research shared by Cushman &amp; Wakefield shows that between 1967 and 2019, American spending on healthcare has been on the rise, even during the recessionary years of 2007-2009. Healthcare spending has been roughly doubling every 13 years, with it accounting for about 18% of the US GDP in 2019, up from 13% in 2000. Consumer spending also steadily rose in the healthcare industry for over 60 years. Between 1959 and 2019, the average annual growth rate was calculated at 3.7%. This stands in stark contrast to the general belief that consumer spending always drops during recessions, and goes to show that some industries can conversely benefit in times of recession, as they offer products and services that cannot be cut out of everyday life for most people.Story continues10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.Let's now take a look at 10 companies and industries that make money during a recession.Our MethodologyWe have combined data from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis and Bloomberg to pick 10 companies that have proven to perform well during the global recession in 2008. To measure their resistance to recessions, we have considered their stock performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 during 2008, using Yahoo Finance's historical stock price data where needed. We also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the company's stocks. They are ranked based on their outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008, from the lowest to the highest percentage.Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 8.8%The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a world-renowned entertainment company. It operates through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments. The company is based in Burbank, California.On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall reiterated an Overweight rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares, alongside a $125 price target.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has diversified its business to include not only media entertainment but also recreational theme parks and experiences. One result of such diversification has been the company's resilience in times of economic turmoil. During the 2008 financial crisis, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 8.8%. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while Disney's theme parks and cruise business were shut down, Disney+ streaming subscriptions surged to include 73.7 million subscribers by November 2020, relative to the company's goal to reach between 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024. Such growth allowed the company to outperform the S&amp;P 500 by 9% in 2020 as well.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a recession-resistant company investors should look at today.9. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)Industry: Information TechnologyS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 9.9%Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is an application software company providing electronic design automation software products used in the design and testing of integrated circuits. The company is based in Mountain View, California.Peter Sazel at Atlantic Equities re-initiated coverage of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) shares on January 17 with an Overweight rating and a $390 price target.Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a leading technology company that offers a platform for the testing of semiconductor chips and software applications. Analysts consider the semiconductor industry to be a secular growth market, meaning the demand for chip testing and designing services is likely to remain constant even during recessions. This belief is supported by the performance of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) during the 2008 recession when the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 9.9%. Even during the market downturn in 2020, the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 70%.TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, mentioned Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“New to the strategy this quarter was Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), a provider of electronic design automation software products used to design and test integrated circuits. The electronic design automation market is a essentially a duopoly with one other major player in the space. As such, the barriers to entry are very high and will likely remain that way due to rising chip complexity.”8. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS)Industry: Communication ServicesS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 14.8%T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is a wireless telecommunication services company providing mobile communications services in the US, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company is based in Bellevue, Washington.An Overweight rating was reiterated on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) shares on January 5 by analyst Philip Cusick at JPMorgan. The analyst also placed a $200 price target on the stock.T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) has become the second-largest US wireless provider after its merger with Sprint. The company managed to beat the odds during the global 2008 recession by outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by 14.8%. It also outperformed the benchmark index by 55.7% in 2020. Since T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is now an even more significant player in the communication services industry, it may prove to be recession-resistant in the coming years as well, due to its ability to outgrow its primary competitors.7. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 21.37%Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another entertainment and streaming company on our list. It offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and more on its platform. The company has recently also added mobile games across different genres and languages to its arsenal of products.Joseph Bonner at Argus holds a Buy rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares as of January 23. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $340 to $390.Between October 9, 2007, and March 9, 2009, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) brought in a total return of 68.9%, according to Bloomberg. The company is also a lower-cost entertainment option compared to peers like The Walt Disney Company, ensuring that during recessions, consumers on the lookout for cheaper entertainment options would gravitate toward it. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 21.37% in 2008, and its subscriber growth increased by 26% to 9.3 million during the same year. This shows that the company was able to actually perform better during an economic downturn.Polen Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has nearly doubled since its May 2022 lows and was our top performer for both the quarter and the year. In the summer, we added to our position meaningfully after our research indicated that the company’s two new monetization levers (requiring fees for shared passwords and the introduction of an advertising-supported subscription) would be very additive to the company’s revenue and profits beginning in early 2023. The company has since announced plans to disallow password sharing, which should provide a boost to revenue and profit growth nearly immediately as account holders or those that are borrowing passwords are required to pay to continue to watch Netflix content. The ad-supported subscription tier should also be a clear positive, not only for the company’s financials but also for consumers and marketers alike. While the subscription fee for the ad-supported tier is only about $7/month in the U.S., the ad revenue per subscriber that Netflix earns for consumers choosing this option could easily add another $15 per month or more in the U.S., potentially making Netflix’s ad-supported subscription tier the company’s most revenue generative and profitable. Even if more premium subscribers than expected downgrade to the adsupported option, we think there should be significant revenue uplift for Netflix. It appears market participants have been doing this math as well, driving the stock price higher over the last seven months.”6. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Industry: Home Improvement RetailS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 23.9%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a consumer discretionary company operating Home Depot stores across the US. The company sells home improvement products, maintenance, repair, and operations products, and much more. It is based in Atlanta, Georgia.On December 13, Max Rakhlenko at Cowen reiterated an Outperform rating on The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $350 to $379.Typically, sales for a company like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) would fall during a recession because of decreased consumer spending. However, the company is well-versed in allocating capital in a way that grows its value. Over the past 10 years, the company's profit margin increased from 6% to 11%. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 23.9% in 2008. Additionally, in 2020 it was seen that interest rate cuts and a lack of entertainment activities in 2020 actually led to a boom in the housing and home improvement markets. So in 2020, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) outperformed the benchmark index by 5.3% as well.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc.

Fans of Happy Valley have been treated to a look at the opening scene of the new series ahead of it airing on New Year's Day. The BBC One drama is set to return for a third and final series on January 1 and will once again follow Sergeant Catherine Cawood as she unearths a gruesome crime in the Yorkshire countryside.

Photo credit should read: Matt Squire/PA Wire - Matt Squire/PABritain’s TV industry will make fewer hits like Happy Valley under planned changes to the tax system, Jeremy Hunt has been warned.Proposed changes to tax breaks for high-end TV (HETV) would give production companies less reason to film in the UK and drive productions abroad, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Netflix have all warned in a joint letter to the Chancellor.Broadcasters are raising the alarm after the Government outlined plans to increase the threshold at which productions qualify for tax breaks.Currently, productions must spend £1m to qualify for tax relief but the Government wants to raise that level to ensure that only high-end programmes qualify for support. It says the changes are necessary because of recent inflation.In a letter to the Treasury, seen by the Telegraph, the industry warned that many shows “have budgets which are just above the current threshold and any increase would reduce the incentive to produce the programme in the UK, or make it at all”.One industry source warned of a “global arms race” for content and said the sector was “inherently mobile”, meaning that productions could quickly be moved to more attractive destinations.A higher threshold would “go against the original intention behind introducing the HETV tax relief and be self-defeating on a variety of fronts”, the letter to the Treasury claimed.The Crown Season 5, , Netflix drama about the British Royal Family, , Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth IIAnnus Horribilis - Keith Bernstein/NetflixThe tax relief scheme for high-end TV production was introduced in 2013 by then-Chancellor George Osborne amid concerns that many British TV shows were being made abroad.£397m of tax relief was awarded to 355 programmes in the year to March 2022. Series that have qualified for the support in recent years include The Crown, Ghosts, A Very British Scandal, Bridgerton and Friday Night Dinner.The Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact) and Coba, which represents the commercial broadcasters and streamers, signed the letter to the Treasury alongside the individual companies.John McVay, chief executive of Pact, warned that the proposed changes would hit domestic productions hardest as many shows that take advantage of the tax credit are “uniquely British” – in particular comedy.Story continuesMany foreign countries offer substantial incentives for the film and TV industry. Ireland offers tax credits of up to 34pc, while Spain recently invested €1.6bn to attract foreign productions.Broadcasters called for the Government to instead differentiate high-end TV shows through clearer legal definitions – in particular for documentaries - rather than adjusting thresholds.A Treasury spokesman said: “Our world class creative industry is a key growth sector in the UK’s economy, which is why last year we invested £397m in high-end TV tax relief alone, supporting 355 programmes.”]"

50,5106a561-44ac-3b2b-ad23-5d5473f83ba5,AMGN,2023-02-13,Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) investors will be pleased with their notable 52% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgens-nasdaq-amgn-investors-pleased-120021029.html,1676289621,STORY,['AMGN'],"[While Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 14% in the last quarter. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. Unfortunately its return of 32% is below the market return of 60%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Amgen To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 35% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Amgen, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amgen shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 9%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Amgen   you should know about.Of course Amgen may not be the best stock to buy.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The stock market bloodbath that started in 2022 has forced investors to shun the so-called growth companies that have nothing to show in terms of cash or tangible short-term value. That’s because investors tend to flee risky assets towards safe, value plays that can offer them safety and a refuge from volatility during difficult times. Value underperformed growth from 2007 until 2020. But the era of growth dominance seems to have ended. In a report titled Value vs. Growth Investing: Value returns with a Vengeance, JPMorgan analysts said that from 2007 through 2020 value underperformed in all sectors and asset classes. This underperformance reached its peak in 2020. The report said that as the world moved online after the pandemic, innovation and growth saw a lot of traction. The report highlights that this was the time when the markets made the same mistake as they did during the “TMT bubble” by “boosting future normalized growth rates”.The JPMorgan report says that by the end of 2020, “expectations became divorced from reality” as many software and growth companies’ valuations touched unprecedented highs.The report mentioned Tesla, Facebook and other growth companies as examples of huge valuations that were not connected with reality.""Amazon and Microsoft are undoubtedly great companies, but if you had bought them at the height of the TMT bubble in December 1999, it would have taken 10 years and 15 years, respectively, to break even. Valuation – no matter how good the company is – matters, even in the long term.""JPMorgan analysts believe value has been out of fashion for so long that many investors today aren’t used to a value-led market and they are only accustomed to small market rallies that last ""only six to nine months.”Story continues“All of this indicates that we are in for a reckoning that has only just begun.”Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the Dow 30 group of companies and picked the stocks that have a PE ratio of under 20 as of February 10.

CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

After all, the Federal Reserve threw just about everything and the kitchen sink at the problem. As well, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently stated that we’re in the very early stages of disinflation. While he recognized the many challenges ahead, at least some light at the end of the tunnel materialized.Or so you thought. Although the yellow metal took a sharp dip in recent sessions, it’s still very much elevated for the year. Further, gold stocks to buy benefit from key fundamental catalysts. First, a robust labor market translates to more dollars chasing after fewer goods. That right there represents the classic definition of inflation.Second, we’re going full circle with China-related dynamics again imposing hardships on the global economy. While the Chinese government’s decision to reopen met much praise, it also presents a conundrum. Greater economic activity means more resource consumption. And that means higher crude oil prices. Therefore, don’t give up on gold stocks to buy. The party’s just getting started.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCGAUCenterra Gold$6.50NEMNewmont$47.50GOLDBarrick Gold$17.72WPMWheaton Precious Metals$43.07AEMAgnico Eagle Mines$51.64SBSWSibanye Stillwater$9.96BTGB2Gold$3.65Centerra Gold (CGAU)A pile of shining gold bars.Source: ShutterstockA Canadian mining firm, Centerra Gold (NYSE:CGAU) owns and operates the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in British Columbia, Canada, and the Öksüt gold mine in Turkey. Not surprisingly, due to the rapid expansion of the spot gold price, Centerra benefitted handsomely this year. Since the January opener, CGAU gained over 24% of equity value.Nevertheless, CGAU represents a relative value in the charts. During the trailing year, shares stumbled over 20%, though this metric is improving significantly because of recent momentum. On the financials, investors can still pick up a discount on Centerra. Currently, the market prices CGAU at a trailing multiple of 6.28. As a discount to earnings, Centerra ranks better than 70.86% of the competition.Story continuesTurning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg CGAU as a consensus moderate buy. Most recently, CIBC reiterated its hold assessment, though it targets shares hitting $7.84, implying 17.65% upside potential. On average, the consensus price target stands at $7.65, up nearly 15% from the time of writing. Thus, it makes for an intriguing case for gold stocks to buy.Newmont (NEM)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockBased in Greenwood Village, Colorado, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is the world’s largest gold-mining firm. In addition to the yellow metal, Newmont mines copper, silver, zinc and lead. Surprisingly, NEM didn’t post a positive return this year. Since the Jan. opener, shares slipped 2.5%, which is unusual for major gold stocks to buy.As well, in the trailing year, NEM lost more than 23% of equity value. Still, the red ink may attract speculators seeking a discount. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), the business rates as significantly undervalued.Objectively, prospective buyers should consider the company’s three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate of 30.2%. This ranks higher than 76.34% of the industry. As well, Newmont commands solid profitability margins. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg NEM as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $55.88, implying upside potential of over 15%. Thus, it’s easily one of the gold stocks to buy.Barrick Gold (GOLD)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comA gold and copper producer, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) features 16 operating sites in 13 countries. Per its public profile, in 2019, Barrick produced 5.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $894 per ounce and 432 million pounds of copper at all-in sustaining costs of $2.52 per pound.Since the Jan. opener, GOLD stock managed to swing higher to the tune of nearly 3%. Admittedly, that’s not the greatest performance. At the same time, in the trailing year, shares stumbled “only” 7%. Therefore, it’s one of the more stable gold stocks to buy for hedging against inflation.Currently, Barrick enjoys an overall solid financial profile. For instance, its three-year FCF growth rate stands at 49.3%, outpacing 91.78% of its rivals. Moreover, its book growth rate during the same period pinged at 25.2%, ranking well above the sector average. Perusing Wall Street’s opinion, experts peg GOLD as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $21.87, reflecting over 19% upside potential. Again, it’s one of the intriguing gold stocks to buy.Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)A gold bar along with some coins made of precious metals. gold stocksSource: allstars / Shutterstock.comA multinational metals streaming company, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) offers better pricing predictability because of its business model. In exchange for upfront capital, streaming companies purchase all or part of the metals produced by a mining company. Because the terms are already specified in the contract, WPM tends to be one of the better gold stocks to buy during volatile cycles.So far, it’s living up to its reputation. Since the Jan. opener, WPM gained almost 8% of equity value. In the trailing year, shares moved up over 5%. Granted, it’s not a profoundly amazing performance. However, WPM was in the black while other gold stocks to buy floundered in the red.To be fair, Gurufocus.com warns that WPM may be modestly overvalued. Still, you’re getting a great package for the premium. Operationally, Wheaton delivers double-digit revenue growth. On the bottom line, its net margin of 72% obliterates the competition. Plus, it enjoys excellent stability in the balance sheet to boot. Wall Street analysts peg WPM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price implies upside potential of nearly 20%, making it one of the gold stocks to buy.Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)Closeup of a large gold nugget. stocks under $10Source: ShutterstockBased in Toronto, Canada, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) is a gold producer in Finland, Mexico and its home country. Further, its exploration and development activities extend to the U.S. To be sure, Agnico Eagle cuts a riskier profile among gold stocks to buy. Since the January opener, AEM dipped almost 2% of equity value.Nevertheless, in the trailing year, AEM gained 6.5%, undergirding optimism for prospective investors. Currently, Gurufocus.com states that AEM represents a fairly valued business. Objectively, it might be running a rich premium to earnings. However, the company’s three-year growth rate stands at 16.6%, outpacing 73.42% of sector rivals. On the bottom line, Agnico’s net margin pings at 10.36%, outhustling nearly 69% of its peers. Further, the company enjoys a decently stable balance sheet.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AEM as a consensus strong buy. In addition, their price target stands at $63.23, implying upside potential of 20%. Therefore, it’s a great idea for gold stocks to buy against inflation.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Gold nuggets on top of American paper money representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockProbably one of my favorite gold stocks to buy to discuss, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) has always been relevant. Beyond the subject matter of this discussion, Sibanye also specializes in platinum group metals; namely, platinum and palladium. With Russia-sourced commodities effectively out of the picture for the west, Sibanye will likely only grow in relevance.Nevertheless, the market doesn’t appreciate the longer-term implications of geopolitics. Frankly, that’s wild. In the year so far, SBSW dropped nearly 5% of equity value. During the past 365 days, Sibanye saw an erosion of 32% in the charts. Financially, the company cuts an attractive profile. Currently, the market prices SBSW at a forward multiple of 3.88. This rates much lower than the sector median of 14.25 times. Operationally, Sibanye’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 38%. And its net margin is over 13%. Both stats rank above their respective sector median values.Wall Street analysts peg SBSW as a consensus moderate buy. However, there’s nothing moderate about its price target of $15, which implies upside potential of 45%.B2Gold (BTG)gold bars representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockAnother Canadian mining firm, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) owns and operates gold mines in Mali, Namibia and the Philippines. A popular entity among gold stocks to buy, since the January opener, BTG gained over 3% of equity value. And in the trailing year, shares actually moved into positive territory, albeit by the slimmest of margins.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, B2Gold rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Objectively, BTG’s price-to-projected FCF ratio pings at 0.76 times. In contrast, the sector median value is 1.46 times.Operationally, B2Gold’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.4%, outpacing 72.47% of its rivals. As well, the company’s FCF growth rate during the same period pings at 20.1%, above 65.14% of the industry. Further, B2Gold commands strong profitability margins, especially its operating margin of over 30%. Looking to Wall Street, analysts peg BTG as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target of $5.57 implies upside potential of almost 47%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

It plans to store the gas or transport it to consumers on exisitng and a minority of new gas grids.Europe's biggest economy aims to eventually replace natural gas, especially that from Russia, and create a new value chain for green hydrogen that it expects to be drawing from imports and domestic production.The Oehringen ""hydrogen island"", an area in a town near Heilbronn with detached family homes, has been receiving a mix of natural gas plus gradually more hydrogen from its pipeline operator Netze BW - a subsidiary of utility EnBW - since autumn 2022.Netze's adjacent regional offices in Oehringen got the blends ahead of the homes, reaching a 30% mix already last summer.""Within the next two weeks, we will raise the share from 8% to 20% and two weeks further on, we will get to 30% in the households,"" project leader Heike Gruener told Reuters during a visit.The blending happens on the Netze BW site, using bought-in renewable power which is put through an electrolysis plant.The company wanted to show that the pipeline infrastructure and boilers, radiators and hobs can adapt to the mix without major replacements or adjustments. It said it hoped to demonstrate that repurposing Germany's huge gas infrastructure to serve homes and industry could work.Story continues""Of course we are looking to show that 100% hydrogen can work also. But that will only be roughly in the middle of this decade,"" Gruener added.Germany can capitalise on experiences well into the 1970s with town gas, made by burning coal and containing up to 50% hydrogen, she added.""There is no noticeable difference to 100% gas,"" said Andreas Frasch, a pensioner who participates in the tests.

One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.Despite the increase in feedgas flows to Freeport, U.S. gas futures fell about 5% on Monday, putting the contract on track to close at a 25-month low.That is because the gas market was more focused on a decline in domestic demand for the fuel for heating with the weather expected to remain mostly warmer than normal for the rest of February.Story continuesFULL OPERATIONS STILL MONTHS AWAYOn Saturday, Texas residents grilled U.S. energy regulators over their supervision of Freeport and other LNG plants.Bryan Lethcoe, a regional director at the U.S. Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), said it would take ""a number of months"" for Freeport to return to full operation.That is similar to the ""mid-March or later"" timeframe many energy analysts have projected for Freeport's full return.Officials at Freeport had no comment.A couple of Freeport's customers - Japan's JERA and Osaka Gas - have said they do not expect to get LNG from the plant until after March.Freeport's other big buyers include units of BP PLC, TotalEnergies and SK E&amp;S.BP's Kmarin Diamond was the first vessel to pick up LNG at Freeport since the plant shut.The tanker, which has already left the facility and is on its way to the Suez Canal in Egypt, picked up LNG to create space in Freeport's storage tanks for new LNG expected to be produced.There is already another vessel at the plant - Prism Agility - operated by South Korea's SK E&amp;S, according to Refinitiv and other ship tracking data.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study General Dynamics'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:18% = US$3.4b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, General Dynamics seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 10%. Despite this, General Dynamics' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Therefore, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared General Dynamics' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 7.7% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GD? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is General Dynamics Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (implying that the company keeps 60% of its income) over the last three years, General Dynamics has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, General Dynamics has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 39% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 20%.SummaryOverall, we feel that General Dynamics certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

63,260c8f27-38fa-3e34-9251-b0fbe43b77bf,GD,2023-02-13,The 5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy (With Dividends) for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-best-defense-stocks-buy-210136114.html,1675976496,STORY,"['GD', 'LMT', 'CDRE', 'RTX', 'NOC']","[War is good business.The U.S. has been in a continuous state of war or war readiness since Dec. 7, 1941.While the war in Afghanistan ended for the U.S. in 2021, the United States is now the largest western supplier for the War in Ukraine, which began in earnest a year ago.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis has been very good for investors in defense stocks. While the Nasdaq is down 14% over the last two years, the biggest defense stocks are up an average of 40%. Most also pay fat dividends.War may be all hell, as William Tecumseh Sherman wrote. But it is phenomenally profitable. It’s one of the primary reasons America remains the world’s dominant power. America is quite good at it.Unsurprisingly then, the U.S. is also very good at running defense companies. When government funding lags, defense contractors merge around the latest technologies. When funding rises, the survivors control the resulting market growth.As an investor, you can do quite well with the usual defense suspects. But the best performer lately doesn’t make weapons at all. Here are the five best defense stocks to buy (with dividends) for February 2023.Best Defense Stocks for February: Cadre Holdings (CDRE)To defuse a bomb, military bulletproof vest, helmet, CDRE stockSource: The world of words / Shutterstock.comCadre Holdings (NASDAQ:CDRE), based in Jacksonville, Florida, makes safety and survivability equipment. Its brands include Safariland, which makes its body armor, Med-Eng, whose products protect soldiers and police from blasts, and Armor Systems.Armor CEO William Kanders led the investor group that bought Armor from European aerospace company BAE Systems (OTCMKTS:BAESY) in 2012 for $124 million. He still controls 77% of the stock, which came public in November of 2021. Cadre is now worth $853 million and Kanders serves as executive chairman. CDRE stock is up over 50% since its initial public offering (IPO).Since coming public, Cadre has made some small acquisitions, buying European holster company Radar Leather and chemical illumination company Cyalume. Both were said to be adding to earnings at the time of the deals.Story continuesCadre has big civilian markets as well as military contracts, protecting the first responders with body armor and other equipment. Cadre had sales of $111.5 million in the September quarter, on which it earned a net income of nearly $5 million, 13 cents per share. Operating cash flow came in at $29.5 million. For the December quarter analysts are expecting 21 cents per share of earnings and $115.7 million in sales. Those numbers are due on March 9.If you want growth in defense but don’t want to buy a weapons company, Cadre may be a good choice.Northrup Grumman (NOC)Szczecin,Poland-January 2022:Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk taking off from an airfield equipped with drone control equipment.3D Illustration.Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, Northrup Grumman (NYSE:NOC) stock is up 49%. It has also delivered $11.35 per share in dividends, a yield of 1.56% at its Feb. 7 price of $445 per share. And NOC’s dividend has increased during that time by 20%.Northrup Grumman turns every advance of Silicon Valley into defense equipment. Whether it’s artificial intelligence, robotics. or the latest chips, the company has an inside track on guaranteed profits from government contracts.Northrup Grumman gets 88% of its revenue from defense contracts and had $31.4 billion worth of them last year. In the December quarter, it turned 20% of $10 billion in revenue into net income. The company makes planes like the recently revealed B-21 stealth bomber, unmanned craft like the Global Hawk, and the back-end technology controlling them.A Goldman Sachs downgrade of the sector sent the stock plunging in January, despite management raising its sales forecast. Analysts are worried about whether the new B-21 stealth bomber can be profitable, and about Republican calls for defense spending cuts. One of the 15 analysts following the stock at Tipranks even has the sell light on.But hawks always have something to worry about, and the U.S. isn’t the only customer for what Northrup Grumman offers. You don’t have to rush into this stock, but you can accumulate it on weakness, set it aside, and see a long-term profit. It’s currently selling for just 14 times earnings.Best Defense Stocks for February: General Dynamics (GD)US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015Source: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stock is up 46%. It has delivered $9.80 per share in dividends and has a current yield of 2.17%. At its recent price of $228 per share, the company was worth over $62.5 billion, just over 1.5 times last year’s $39.4 billion in revenue.General Dynamics makes submarines, guided missile destroyers, and is best known today for the M1 Abrams tank. It also makes the Gulfstream business jet.General Dynamics was the 5th largest defense contractor last year, coming in behind Northrup Grumman with $30 billion of revenue. Nearly one-quarter of revenue came from outside defense, mainly from Gulfstream, but it is expanding in the non-defense market for supercomputers.However, it’s the Abrams, which Ukraine very much wants, that has been getting the headlines lately. The tank comes with lucrative service contracts. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) recently bought more shares, raising its stake in the company to 5.7%.Value investors like GD stock a lot, calling it a “wealth compounder.” Its January weakness doesn’t change the investment case, which is based on long-term dividend returns. The weaker the stock gets, the better that dividend will look. The company is good for it. Of 12 analysts now following General Dynamics stock at Tipranks, eight are saying buy it, and none are suggesting a sell.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is up 38%. It has delivered $22 in dividends during that time. It recently announced another $3 per share will be paid out to shareholders of record on Feb. 28. At $465 per share, it has a market capitalization of $119 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.5, and a current yield of 2.56%.Lockheed Martin is the nation’s largest defense contractor, with $61.5 billion in contracts during 2021.  It is also the contractor most dependent on the government with 97% of revenue coming from the Department of Defense.Lockheed makes the F-35 fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, and the AEGIS combat control system. It has contracts with NASA and other public and private space-focused entities. It has also developed hypersonic missiles, which can travel 25 times the speed of sound.The profits should keep rolling in, because Lockheed has a huge backlog of orders, especially for the F-16 fighter jet. It continues to have ties deep in the federal government. Johnathan Caldwell, general manager of its military space division, got an advisory appointment from the Biden administration this month.Analysts are more supportive of Lockheed Martin than its competitors. Credit Suisse recently moved it from a “sell” to a “buy” based on accelerating growth. This may be the first of several upgrades. Right now, the average Tipranks rating is a hold.Best Defense Stocks for February: Raytheon Technologies (RTX)A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house. Defense stocks.Source: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, shares in Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) are up nearly 39%. During that time, it has also delivered $4.16 per share in dividends. At about $97 per share, it has a market cap of $144 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and a yield of 2.53%.Think of Raytheon as the military’s rocket men. It is a primary supplier to other defense contractors but also brings them in on some projects.Raytheon is best known for missiles, but it also makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and owns Collins Aerospace, which supplies the military with space assets. This has made it the second-largest military contractor, bringing in nearly $42 billion in 2021. That’s 65% of its total revenue, which came to $64 billion last year.Raytheon’s dominance in key rocket and space niches gives it a bright future, and not just in defense. Most of its profit gains are coming in from Collins or Pratt &amp; Whitney contracts outside defense.That’s because Pratt &amp; Whitney powers commercial airliners and the engines have a big aftermarket. The company delivered $4.9 billion in free cash flow last year, most of it in the fourth quarter, earning $1.4 billion, $1.27 per share, on $18 billion in revenue. Another dividend increase is likely. Of 13 analysts following Raytheon at Tipranks eight say buy it, and five are in the “hold” camp. None say “sell.”On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held no positions in any companies mentioned in this article.

Most importantly, investors should consider this subsegment due to its lucrative profile.For instance, McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that by 2026, “…global renewable-electricity capacity will rise more than 80 percent from 2020 levels (to more than 5,022 gigawatts).1 Of this growth, two-thirds will come from wind and solar, an increase of 150 percent (3,404 gigawatts).” Therefore, green energy stocks to buy command a bright future.This list of market ideas, they’re arranged in order of Wall Street analysts’ price target, from low to high. Therefore, even if you don’t agree with the underlying politics, these energy stocks to buy should still appeal to your capitalistic sensibilities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCWENClearway Energy$32.42CEGConstellation Energy$84.40NEPNextEra Energy$71.70CCJCameco$28.81BEPBrookfield Renewable$27.80TACTransAlta$9.11HTOOFusion Fuel$3.47Energy Stocks to Buy: Clearway Energy (CWEN)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S., Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) commands over 5,500 net megawatts (MW) of installed wind and solar generation projects. The company’s over 8,000 net MW of assets also include approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas generation facilities, per its website.What should make CWEN an attractive candidate for energy stocks to buy centers on the value proposition. Presently, the market prices CWEN at a trailing multiple of 6.8. As a discount to earnings, Clearway ranks better than 80.72% of the industry. Also, CWEN trades at 5.41 times free cash flow (FCF), representing a discount that ranks better than 66.31% of its peers.Story continuesTurning to Wall Street, analysts peg CWEN as a consensus moderate buy. Most recently, RBC Capital reiterated a “hold” rating with a price target of $36, implying 9.82% upside potential. Overall, the consensus price forecast stands at $37.50, implying an upside potential of 14.4%.

For instance, its Altman Z-Score reading sits at 0.98, reflecting a distressed business. It also indicates a higher-than-normal probability of bankruptcy within the next two years. Also, its profitability metrics could be improved.However, on the positive side, the market prices CEG at a sales multiple of 1.18. As a discount to the top line, Constellation ranks better than 69.47% of its competitors. Also, its enterprise-value-to-revenue ratio is 1.42 times, favorably lower than the industry median of 4.23 times. Currently, analysts peg CEG as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $101.30, implying an upside potential of over 20%. Therefore, CEG ranks among the top clean energy stocks to buy.Energy Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy Partners (NEP)ESG stocks: Solar energy panels are arranged in a green field under a sunny sky.Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.comA subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) purchases and owns wind, solar power, and natural gas pipeline projects in North America. Since the Jan. opener, NEP gained a bit more than 2% of equity value. However, 2022 has been a choppy road for the subsidiary, with shares slipping 4%.Nevertheless, NEP might attract speculators for its underlying value proposition. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), NEP rates as modestly undervalued. On an objective basis, the market prices NEP at a trailing multiple of 12.78. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 62.25% of industry players.Also, it’s worth noting that on the bottom line, NEP features a net margin of 39.39%. This stat outpaces 87.56% of the competition. At the moment, Wall Street analysts peg NEP as a consensus moderate buy.

Therefore, go-green initiatives can’t ignore the sector, particularly because of nuclear fuel’s astounding energy density.To be fair, investors will need to exercise some patience with CCJ at this juncture. And that’s because Gurufocus.com labels CCJ as a significantly overvalued investment. Plus, the market prices CCJ at a trailing multiple of 119.3, which is astronomical.On the flip side, Cameco enjoys a stable balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.87, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Also, after revenue fell sharply in 2021, Cameco is back on the upswing. On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, the company’s sales haul stands at $1.4 billion, almost at parity with 2020’s result. Right now, analysts peg CCJ as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target implies an upside potential of nearly 27%.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA publicly traded limited partnership, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) owns and operates renewable power assets. As of the end of 2017, Brookfield Renewable owned over 200 hydroelectric plants, 100 wind farms, over 550 solar facilities, and four storage facilities, with approximately 16,400 MW of installed capacity.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, BEP rates as a modestly undervalued investment. On an objective basis, the market prices BEP at a sales multiple of 1.67. As a discount to the revenue line item, Brookfield ranks better than 62.63% of its rivals. Further, BEP trades at 5.6 times operating cash flow, below the sector median of 8.85 times.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg BEP as a consensus moderate buy. To be fair, the most recent analyst rating saw Industrial Alliance Securities downgrade shares to a “hold.” However, the overall average price target stands at $35.96, implying an upside potential of over 30%. Thus, BEP ranks among the top green energy stocks to buy.TransAlta (TAC)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comAn electricity power generator and wholesale marketing company, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) operates 75 power plants in Canada, the U.S., and Australia. To be fair, it’s not a pure-play example of green energy stocks to buy. Still, it operates wind, hydro, and natural gas (the cleanest fossil fuel) generation facilities, as well as coal.Generally speaking, TransAlta offers a solid fiscal profile. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.6%, ranking better than 63.55% of the industry. On the bottom line, its net margin pings at 20.1%, outpacing 61.30% of its peers. As well, its return on equity rings the register at 8%, implying a quality business.Despite these strengths, the market prices TAC at a sales multiple of 1.23. As a discount to revenue, TransAlta ranks better than 68.42% of its peers. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg TAC as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $12.19, implying an upside potential of over 33%.Fusion Fuel Green (HTOO)An image of a hydrogen fueling station against a blue sky.Source: DesignRage / Shutterstock.comAn ambitious enterprise, Fusion Fuel Green (NASDAQ:HTOO) focuses on innovative green hydrogen solutions. Per its website, the company developed a revolutionary new electrolyzer design – the HEVO – that will allow it to produce hydrogen using renewable energy at highly competitive costs without any associated carbon emissions.While compelling, prospective investors should recognize the risks associated with this pure-play candidate for green energy stocks to buy. For the year so far, HTOO dropped 21% of its equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, shares tumbled nearly 40%. Basically, it’s not for the faint of heart.At the moment, Fusion Fuel offers some compelling stats, though we could be talking about a possible bear trap. For instance, the market prices HTOO at a trailing multiple of 2.1. As a discount, this supposedly ranks better than 96% of the competition. One decisively positive attribute stems from the balance sheet, specifically Fusion’s cash-to-debt ratio of 12.25 times. Despite the risks, H.C. Wainwright labels HTOO a “buy.” As well, it sees shares gaining over 314% from here. If so, it would be one of the best green energy stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks.Despite a population of just 3.7 million people, if all U.S. states were countries, Connecticut would be the 67th largest country in the world, bigger than Finland, Czech Republic, Portugal and New Zealand, with a 2021 GDP of nearly $300 billion.Connecticut has been a manufacturing state since the colonization era, with its factories providing stiff competition to those in England. Through the decades, the state has given the world many new inventions including steamboats, lollipops, corkscrews and vulcanized rubber among others. This is why you will also see manufacturing companies among the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. Meanwhile, insurance companies are also a huge contributor to the state's economy with Connecticut being known as an insurance state for close to 200 years now. Agriculture may not have the same influence it did in previous centuries, but it is also still an important contributor to the economy of the state.25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocksSean Pavone/Shutterstock.comEven though Connecticut had the highest per capita personal income of any state in 2013, it also had the second-largest disparity in income between the top 1% and the bottom 99%, which showed a high level of inequality and standard of living for people in the state. Currently, Connecticut's unemployment rate is 4.2%, with only 11 states recording worse unemployment rates. This is still a significant improvement from November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.2% while the pre-pandemic unemployment rate was 3.4% in February 2020. Even though the unemployment rate is relatively high, the state has seen ten consecutive months of job growths but still trails the national average.Like most states in the U.S., Connecticut provides significant support to businesses in the state to encourage more companies to incorporate or initiate in the state and possibly even join the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. These incentives include providing grant-in-arrears equal to the value of 25% of withholding taxes from net new employees for eligible companies which have at least 25 employees. Specific eligible employers can receive a grant of up to 50% and these grants are available for up to 9 years. The state also operates tax credit programs which provide nonrefundable corporate income tax credits to eligible companies who invest at least $5 million in facilities in eligible areas. Meanwhile, several tax exemptions can also be availed based on specific situations including sales and use tax exemption, real and personal property tax exemption, and data center tax exemptions. In addition, businesses located in an enterprise zone could be eligible for ""an abatement on real and business personal property taxes of up to 80% for 5 years and a 10-year, 25% tax credit on the portion of the Connecticut corporation business tax that is directly attributable to the company relocation, expansion or renovation project. The credit may increase to 50% based on the number of new jobs created.""Story continuesThe 20 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks have combined revenues of around $420 billion and a market cap of around $550 billion. To determine these companies, we first extracted the biggest Connecticut companies by revenue from Fortune 500 and confirmed their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance.

It plans to store the gas or transport it to consumers on exisitng and a minority of new gas grids.Europe's biggest economy aims to eventually replace natural gas, especially that from Russia, and create a new value chain for green hydrogen that it expects to be drawing from imports and domestic production.The Oehringen ""hydrogen island"", an area in a town near Heilbronn with detached family homes, has been receiving a mix of natural gas plus gradually more hydrogen from its pipeline operator Netze BW - a subsidiary of utility EnBW - since autumn 2022.Netze's adjacent regional offices in Oehringen got the blends ahead of the homes, reaching a 30% mix already last summer.""Within the next two weeks, we will raise the share from 8% to 20% and two weeks further on, we will get to 30% in the households,"" project leader Heike Gruener told Reuters during a visit.The blending happens on the Netze BW site, using bought-in renewable power which is put through an electrolysis plant.The company wanted to show that the pipeline infrastructure and boilers, radiators and hobs can adapt to the mix without major replacements or adjustments. It said it hoped to demonstrate that repurposing Germany's huge gas infrastructure to serve homes and industry could work.Story continues""Of course we are looking to show that 100% hydrogen can work also. But that will only be roughly in the middle of this decade,"" Gruener added.Germany can capitalise on experiences well into the 1970s with town gas, made by burning coal and containing up to 50% hydrogen, she added.""There is no noticeable difference to 100% gas,"" said Andreas Frasch, a pensioner who participates in the tests.

One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.Despite the increase in feedgas flows to Freeport, U.S. gas futures fell about 5% on Monday, putting the contract on track to close at a 25-month low.That is because the gas market was more focused on a decline in domestic demand for the fuel for heating with the weather expected to remain mostly warmer than normal for the rest of February.Story continuesFULL OPERATIONS STILL MONTHS AWAYOn Saturday, Texas residents grilled U.S. energy regulators over their supervision of Freeport and other LNG plants.Bryan Lethcoe, a regional director at the U.S. Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), said it would take ""a number of months"" for Freeport to return to full operation.That is similar to the ""mid-March or later"" timeframe many energy analysts have projected for Freeport's full return.Officials at Freeport had no comment.A couple of Freeport's customers - Japan's JERA and Osaka Gas - have said they do not expect to get LNG from the plant until after March.Freeport's other big buyers include units of BP PLC, TotalEnergies and SK E&amp;S.BP's Kmarin Diamond was the first vessel to pick up LNG at Freeport since the plant shut.The tanker, which has already left the facility and is on its way to the Suez Canal in Egypt, picked up LNG to create space in Freeport's storage tanks for new LNG expected to be produced.There is already another vessel at the plant - Prism Agility - operated by South Korea's SK E&amp;S, according to Refinitiv and other ship tracking data.

(NASDAQ:EXPE) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Expedia Group The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.11bUS$2.35bUS$2.39bUS$2.44bUS$2.53bUS$2.59bUS$2.65bUS$2.71bUS$2.77bUS$2.83bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.25%Est @ 2.20%Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.13% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$1.9kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.1%) = US$39bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$39b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$16bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$31b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$108, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Expedia Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.243. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Expedia GroupStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for EXPE.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

My name is Emily, and I'll be the operator for today's call. For opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, Strategy and Investor Relations, Harshit Vaish. Please go ahead.Harshit Vaish: Good afternoon, and welcome to Expedia Group's earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2022 that ended December 31. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by our CEO, Peter Kern, and our CFO, Julie Whalen.

And I encourage you to consistently visit our IR website for other important information. Unless otherwise stated, any reference to expenses excludes stock-based compensation. And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter.Peter Kern: Thank you, Harshit. And good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us today. This past year was an important one in our company's journey. We did a ton of work and made great progress on many transformational initiatives, all while delivering record EBITDA. Q4 was yet another step in that journey, despite the impact to our P&amp;L from the severe weather. Hurricane Ian in early October and the winter storms in late December drove up cancellations, causing bookings and revenue for the quarter to come in behind our expectations, despite demand otherwise accelerating through the quarter. The good news is that we have seen those booking trends come back much stronger in January post the disruptions. So, 2023 is off to a great start.Story continuesAnd we were really pleased that our investment over the last several years in service technology and capabilities allowed us to deliver best-in-class service through these difficult travel circumstance. As I've said many times before, when your strategy is centered around long term retention of valuable customers, every element of the work must deliver for the traveler. So big thanks to our service team for all their hard work, especially over the holidays. Now, as we launch into 2023, I'm particularly pleased with how our strategy of investing in and retaining high lifetime value members is showing accelerating improvement across our business. For the fourth quarter of 2022 versus 2019, our new customers that became loyalty members grew over 60%.And we entered 2020 with a record number of active loyalty members, which is 10% higher than any prior year. And just as importantly, our quarterly active app users increased by approximately 40%. For us, these are the most important metrics to gauge the progress of our strategy. Just to remind you, our loyalty members each drive two times the gross profit on repeat business over an 18-month period as compared to non-members. And our app users each drive 2.5 times the gross profit on repeat business over the same period. When you combine these two and have a loyalty member who also uses the app, this drives the highest production of all, and that group represented the fastest growing customer cohort for us in 2022. But as strong as those numbers are, for our overall business, they're even better in our Expedia brand in the US.This is extremely important because Expedia US is the business where we've been able to make our fastest product and marketing improvements, and where we have the most complete set of capabilities to support our strategy. And the evidence is clear. In the fourth quarter of 22 versus 2019, Expedia US grew new customers that became loyalty members by over 300% and entered 2023 with nearly 70% more active loyalty members than any prior year, and almost 60% more active app users. Expedia US was able to deliver almost 20% revenue growth in 2022 as compared to 2019, and there's still plenty of improvements yet to come. Of course, when you look at our all-up B2C numbers, the accelerating performance of Expedia US has been largely offset by our intentional deemphasis of some smaller non-core brands, our pullback in certain geographies where we did not have the right model, and of course, our much discussed technical migration, which required significant work, and like all migrations resulted in some short term friction.But what I'm really excited about is that with the proof now very clear that our strategy is working, we will begin more aggressively rolling it out to our other brands and our non-US markets. After years of democratizing travel, we are now taking a leap forward to use cutting edge technology, a better marketplace, a broader rewards program, and best-in-class service to drive true customer benefit and loyalty. Because when you take care of customers and give them great experiences, they keep coming back. And that's how you win. In support of this long term strategy, you will see us maintain a higher mix of marketing spend to channels that attract desirable long term customers, rather than just chasing short term transactions. Therefore, the parameters of when and who is worth marketing to and winning as a customer will be different.We have clearly proven the value of attracting and retaining the right customers, and increasingly, our P&amp;L will reflect that. We're starting 2023 with the highest number of active loyalty members and app users for any year. And we will see further momentum in the business this year thanks to a much larger base of loyal customers. Of course, our confidence in our strategy is ultimately only possible because of the underlying technology that we have invested so much in over the last several years. This is what has enabled Expedia US to grow faster. And all of our brands and geographies begin to ride on that same tech stack, we will expand our ability to compete and win in more places. Work that created a drag on our business in 2022 like the migration of hotels.com to our core platform become big on lots for us in 2023.As one example of this, we expect our test velocity around optimizing our sites to grow roughly fourfold with the same resources this year and more engineers and product team members are freed up post migration and our tests can be run across our entire base of core OTA traffic. In other words, we will have many more tests where the winners get deployed across a much larger base. And as we continue to invest further in product and technology and new features and capabilities to take online travel to the next level, these improvements increasingly impact more and more of our customers more rapidly worldwide. No travel player in the world has done more over the last few years to innovate around the shopping and service experience to improve the travel journey for the consumer.And just to emphasize the point, all of our advances in technology, in product and in customer service not only benefit our direct customers, but continue to benefit our expanding base of B2B partners as well. Our B2B business is one of the largest in the world and continues to grow rapidly. The breadth and depth of our products are expanding as is our partner base, reinforcing the importance of our supply and our technology as the core operating system of the travel market. To that end, we added many new partners and grew significantly in 2022, despite agents still being greatly constrained. With the return of travel into and out of China in 2023 and a robust pipeline of new partners around the world, we anticipate significant growth and a great year for our B2B business.So as we wrap up what was the most profitable year in our history, we begin what will be another exciting year of growth and the last in our major technical overhaul. This coming year, we will finish moving all of our brands on to one front-end stack. Vrbo, the last major brands to come across, has already been testing traffic on the new front end, and will make the final migration in the coming months. This last step will then allow us to launch our new One Key loyalty program, which will span all of our main brands. It will be the broadest, most flexible loyalty program in the world. And for the first time, give vacation home renters the benefits of a loyalty program. And importantly, it will complement our many partners loyalty programs as well.So overall, I'm confident that with more technical tailwinds and headwinds this year, and with a proven strategy that we will be expanding on, we will once again drive strong financial growth while completing the last of our major changes. It has taken several years and a lot of hard work, investment and patience. But we're extremely gratified about where we are and what we know we can deliver going forward. And I'm even more excited about moving the last big boulders of our plan across the line and driving greater acceleration in the future. And with that, let me hand it over to Julie.Nature, Travel, VacationPhoto by Simon English on UnsplashJulie Whalen: Thanks, Peter. And hello, everyone. 2022 was a year of significant progress on our strategic growth initiatives. And our financial results are evidence that we are on the right path to deliver long term profitable growth. The accelerating success of our lodging business, particularly in our brand Expedia business in the US, which is the first of our brands to benefit from our transformative tech and marketing initiatives, enabled us to deliver total company record lodging bookings and revenue. And we did this while at the same time driving significant profitability with record EBITDA levels at over $2.3 billion and an EBITDA margin of over 20%. Our fourth quarter also benefited from continued strong lodging demand, but unfortunately was heavily impacted by Hurricane Ian in October, and the storms in the US during December.Absent these weather related events, as well as FX headwinds, our results on both the top and bottom line would have been at record fourth quarter levels. As far as the details regarding our financial performance for the fourth quarter, similar to previous earnings calls, I will discuss our revenue related and adjusted EBITDA growth metrics this quarter both on a recorded and like-for-like basis. The like-for-like growth rates excludes the contribution from Egencia, Amex GBT and the non-lodging elements of our Chase relationship. As a reminder, on November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Egencia and our EPS business entered into a 10 year lodging supply agreement with Amex GBT. It is also important to note that our fourth quarter 2022 growth rates as compared to 2019 were negatively impacted by FX headwinds of approximately 250 basis points to gross bookings, 400 basis points to revenue, and 800 basis points to adjusted EBITDA or 70 basis points to our adjusted EBITDA margin.We believe these like-for-like numbers and the disclosure of the negative impact from FX headwinds are helpful in assessing the operational performance of our business. Please note that we will discontinue disclosing these like-for-like numbers next quarter, the first quarter of 2023, as we move away from comparing our financial performance to 2019 levels and move towards standard year-over-year comparisons. Now let's move back to our performance this quarter, starting with our gross booking trends. Total gross bookings were down 12% on a reported basis and down 2% on a like-for-like basis versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Total gross bookings were impacted by a spike in cancellations and lost transactions related to the hurricane and the winter storms in the US, as previously mentioned.If we further adjust for the approximately 250 basis points negative impact from FX during the quarter, our gross bookings would have been above 2019 levels. Growth was driven by total lodging gross bookings, which were the highest Q4 on record at plus 4% on a reported basis and plus 6% on a like-for-like basis versus Q4 2019. By month, lodging gross bookings on a reported basis were up 3% in October which was impacted by the hurricane, up 7% in November and up 2% In December, which was impacted by the winter storms in the US. Excluding the weather-related events, growth versus 2019 for each month in Q4 reached high-single digits that accelerated through the quarter. And in January, we saw a step change where our lodging gross bookings accelerated even further, growing over 20% versus 2019.While it is still early in the quarter and 2023, we are pleased to see strong lodging demand continue, including total lodging bookings for stays expected to occur in the first half of 2023, continuing to meaningfully outpace 2019 and 2022 levels. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&amp;L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $2.6 billion was down 5% on a reported basis and down 1% on a like-for-like basis versus Q4 2019, and includes the 400 basis point negative impact from FX, as well as the financial impact from the weather related events. Excluding these factors, our reported revenue would have been above 2019 levels. Total revenue margin also improved to 13% for the quarter, or up approximately 90 basis points versus Q4 2019 as we continue to benefit from a mix shift towards our higher margin lodging business, which as a percentage of the total has grown approximately 1,000 basis points over the same period.Cost of sales was $408 million for the quarter, which is a cost reduction of $125 million or 24% and 380 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus 2019, driven by our divestitures and ongoing efficiencies primarily across our customer support operations. Our customer support operations continue to benefit from the various automation initiatives we have implemented over the past couple of years. And we expect that, going forward, with the further consolidation of our tech stack onto a single platform, we should be able to continue to drive efficiencies across our cloud and licensing and maintenance costs as we eliminate systems that are no longer necessary to support. Direct sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, which was up 20% versus 2019.The primary drivers of this increase over 2019 were associated with both our B2B and B2C businesses. Our accelerating growth in our B2B business is driving an increase in commissions paid to our partners. And these commissions fall into our direct sales and marketing line. In our B2C business, we had increased marketing spend to support our accelerating growth during the quarter. Unfortunately, given the storm related cancellations and lost transactions and their impact to the top line at the end of the quarter, we did not fully realize the anticipated return of our marketing spend. In addition, we also have been strategically mixing towards longer term investments in our marketing spend, which, given the longer term return profile of the spend, is less closely correlated to demand within any given quarter.As a result of these two factors, we saw this marketing spend deleverage versus Q4 2019. However, on the full year, we saw leverage in our total B2C spend versus 2019, inclusive of loyalty and discounting, that are contra revenue. And we expect to maintain this leverage for improvement going forward. Overhead expenses were $590 million, a cost reduction of $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 21% and 470 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus 2019. We continue to remain disciplined on our cost structure. And with the expected improvement from the consolidation of our tech stack and general growth initiatives, we believe we can continue to maintain this lower cost structure and drive long term leverage as we deliver accelerating top line growth.Overhead expenses slightly increased from the third quarter, approximately $23 million, as we continue to invest in top talent across our product and technology teams to help accelerate our various platform initiatives in support of our growth strategies that will drive long term financial returns. Adjusted EBITDA was $449 million or down 6% versus for fourth quarter 2019 and was down 2% on a like-for-like basis, which includes the negative impact from the weather related events and FX headwinds. On a margin basis, we were relatively in line with 2019 despite absorbing these negative impacts. And absent these factors, our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew in the mid-teens as compared to 2019. Free cash flow for the full year was strong at positive $2.8 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion, over 70% versus 2019.The strength was driven by our record EBITDA levels on the year and an improved benefit from working capital as well as lower overall capital expenditures, as our spend is now primarily focused on our technology and product transformation. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $6.6 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $4.1 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with ample access to cash to operate the business. This liquidity, combined with our strong free cash flow levels, enabled us to maximize our return of capital to shareholders during the quarter by further accelerating our share buybacks to approximately $350 million or 3.7 million shares in the fourth quarter.This resulted in approximately $500 million and 5.2 million shares being repurchased since the end of September 2022. Even after these buybacks, we enter 2023 with ample levels of shares remaining under our existing authorization for future repurchases at approximately 18 million shares. And given our ongoing strong liquidity, our confidence in the business, and the fact that our stock remains undervalued and does not reflect our accelerating business performance, we plan to continue to buy back our stock opportunistically in 2023. In closing, I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead in 2023 and beyond. With accelerating demand trends and the proof points that our growth initiatives are working, combined with our strong financial position as we enter 2023 with ample liquidity and a higher margin profile business, all of this gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver double digit growth and expanding margins, as well as long term shareholder returns.And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions.

While the Nasdaq is down 14% over the last two years, the biggest defense stocks are up an average of 40%. Most also pay fat dividends.War may be all hell, as William Tecumseh Sherman wrote. But it is phenomenally profitable. It’s one of the primary reasons America remains the world’s dominant power. America is quite good at it.Unsurprisingly then, the U.S. is also very good at running defense companies. When government funding lags, defense contractors merge around the latest technologies. When funding rises, the survivors control the resulting market growth.As an investor, you can do quite well with the usual defense suspects. But the best performer lately doesn’t make weapons at all. Here are the five best defense stocks to buy (with dividends) for February 2023.Best Defense Stocks for February: Cadre Holdings (CDRE)To defuse a bomb, military bulletproof vest, helmet, CDRE stockSource: The world of words / Shutterstock.comCadre Holdings (NASDAQ:CDRE), based in Jacksonville, Florida, makes safety and survivability equipment. Its brands include Safariland, which makes its body armor, Med-Eng, whose products protect soldiers and police from blasts, and Armor Systems.Armor CEO William Kanders led the investor group that bought Armor from European aerospace company BAE Systems (OTCMKTS:BAESY) in 2012 for $124 million. He still controls 77% of the stock, which came public in November of 2021. Cadre is now worth $853 million and Kanders serves as executive chairman. CDRE stock is up over 50% since its initial public offering (IPO).Since coming public, Cadre has made some small acquisitions, buying European holster company Radar Leather and chemical illumination company Cyalume. Both were said to be adding to earnings at the time of the deals.Story continuesCadre has big civilian markets as well as military contracts, protecting the first responders with body armor and other equipment. Cadre had sales of $111.5 million in the September quarter, on which it earned a net income of nearly $5 million, 13 cents per share. Operating cash flow came in at $29.5 million. For the December quarter analysts are expecting 21 cents per share of earnings and $115.7 million in sales. Those numbers are due on March 9.If you want growth in defense but don’t want to buy a weapons company, Cadre may be a good choice.Northrup Grumman (NOC)Szczecin,Poland-January 2022:Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk taking off from an airfield equipped with drone control equipment.3D Illustration.Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, Northrup Grumman (NYSE:NOC) stock is up 49%. It has also delivered $11.35 per share in dividends, a yield of 1.56% at its Feb. 7 price of $445 per share. And NOC’s dividend has increased during that time by 20%.Northrup Grumman turns every advance of Silicon Valley into defense equipment. Whether it’s artificial intelligence, robotics. or the latest chips, the company has an inside track on guaranteed profits from government contracts.Northrup Grumman gets 88% of its revenue from defense contracts and had $31.4 billion worth of them last year. In the December quarter, it turned 20% of $10 billion in revenue into net income. The company makes planes like the recently revealed B-21 stealth bomber, unmanned craft like the Global Hawk, and the back-end technology controlling them.A Goldman Sachs downgrade of the sector sent the stock plunging in January, despite management raising its sales forecast. Analysts are worried about whether the new B-21 stealth bomber can be profitable, and about Republican calls for defense spending cuts. One of the 15 analysts following the stock at Tipranks even has the sell light on.But hawks always have something to worry about, and the U.S. isn’t the only customer for what Northrup Grumman offers. You don’t have to rush into this stock, but you can accumulate it on weakness, set it aside, and see a long-term profit. It’s currently selling for just 14 times earnings.Best Defense Stocks for February: General Dynamics (GD)US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015Source: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stock is up 46%. It has delivered $9.80 per share in dividends and has a current yield of 2.17%. At its recent price of $228 per share, the company was worth over $62.5 billion, just over 1.5 times last year’s $39.4 billion in revenue.General Dynamics makes submarines, guided missile destroyers, and is best known today for the M1 Abrams tank. It also makes the Gulfstream business jet.General Dynamics was the 5th largest defense contractor last year, coming in behind Northrup Grumman with $30 billion of revenue. Nearly one-quarter of revenue came from outside defense, mainly from Gulfstream, but it is expanding in the non-defense market for supercomputers.However, it’s the Abrams, which Ukraine very much wants, that has been getting the headlines lately. The tank comes with lucrative service contracts. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) recently bought more shares, raising its stake in the company to 5.7%.Value investors like GD stock a lot, calling it a “wealth compounder.” Its January weakness doesn’t change the investment case, which is based on long-term dividend returns. The weaker the stock gets, the better that dividend will look. The company is good for it. Of 12 analysts now following General Dynamics stock at Tipranks, eight are saying buy it, and none are suggesting a sell.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is up 38%. It has delivered $22 in dividends during that time. It recently announced another $3 per share will be paid out to shareholders of record on Feb. 28. At $465 per share, it has a market capitalization of $119 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.5, and a current yield of 2.56%.Lockheed Martin is the nation’s largest defense contractor, with $61.5 billion in contracts during 2021.  It is also the contractor most dependent on the government with 97% of revenue coming from the Department of Defense.Lockheed makes the F-35 fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, and the AEGIS combat control system. It has contracts with NASA and other public and private space-focused entities. It has also developed hypersonic missiles, which can travel 25 times the speed of sound.The profits should keep rolling in, because Lockheed has a huge backlog of orders, especially for the F-16 fighter jet. It continues to have ties deep in the federal government. Johnathan Caldwell, general manager of its military space division, got an advisory appointment from the Biden administration this month.Analysts are more supportive of Lockheed Martin than its competitors. Credit Suisse recently moved it from a “sell” to a “buy” based on accelerating growth. This may be the first of several upgrades. Right now, the average Tipranks rating is a hold.Best Defense Stocks for February: Raytheon Technologies (RTX)A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house. Defense stocks.Source: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, shares in Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) are up nearly 39%. During that time, it has also delivered $4.16 per share in dividends. At about $97 per share, it has a market cap of $144 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and a yield of 2.53%.Think of Raytheon as the military’s rocket men. It is a primary supplier to other defense contractors but also brings them in on some projects.Raytheon is best known for missiles, but it also makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and owns Collins Aerospace, which supplies the military with space assets. This has made it the second-largest military contractor, bringing in nearly $42 billion in 2021. That’s 65% of its total revenue, which came to $64 billion last year.Raytheon’s dominance in key rocket and space niches gives it a bright future, and not just in defense. Most of its profit gains are coming in from Collins or Pratt &amp; Whitney contracts outside defense.That’s because Pratt &amp; Whitney powers commercial airliners and the engines have a big aftermarket. The company delivered $4.9 billion in free cash flow last year, most of it in the fourth quarter, earning $1.4 billion, $1.27 per share, on $18 billion in revenue. Another dividend increase is likely. Of 13 analysts following Raytheon at Tipranks eight say buy it, and five are in the “hold” camp. None say “sell.”On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held no positions in any companies mentioned in this article.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Pipeline Companies in the World.Global Energy Monitor estimates that as of December 2020, there were at least 2,381 active oil and gas pipelines spread over 162 nations. The total length of these pipes exceeds 1.18 million km, which is enough to circle the Earth 30 times. The pipeline sector is part of the “midstream” oil industry, and according to Mordor Intelligence, it is forecasted to register a CAGR of more than 6.5% by 2027.Global Data claims that Asia will lead the world in terms of pipeline length expansion, adding 58,021 km to its oil and gas pipeline network by 2026. North America and Europe come in second and third, with pipeline lengths forecasted to be 20,022 km and 17,151 km, respectively, by 2026. The growth in pipeline length does not mean that the sector is not facing any challenges. The anti-pipeline movement poses the most serious threat to pipeline firms. The movement is against the pipeline industry due to the negative effects of carbon fuels on the environment. The movement is gaining traction, from the protests against Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 to the more recent protests against the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline in 2022. Reacting to the trend, many of the large pipeline firms have begun to create clean energy portfolios. These include Canada’s biggest pipeline company, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), which has been expanding its offshore wind portfolio.Largest Pipeline Companies in the WorldPipeline in industrial districtLast year, the pipeline industry was thrust under the spotlight as a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Russia is Europe's principal supplier of natural gas. Russia supplied 45% of the EU's natural gas imports in 2021. The Russian SOE and its largest pipeline company, Gazprom, operates the majority of the gas pipelines, including Nord Stream. An episode of pipeline politics followed in February 2022 when Germany stopped the certification process for Nord Stream 2. This gas pipeline was designed to double the flow of Russian gas to Germany, so its closure has the potential to create significant losses for Russia.Story continuesIn September 2022, a series of explosives damaged at least 50 meters of the Nord Stream pipeline. Gazprom had cut off gas supplies prior to the attack, citing technical problems, but after the attack, the west accused Russia of organizing the bombings.In such challenging times, marked by concerns over war and climate change, it will be interesting to observe how these pipeline behemoths retain their growth.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 15 largest pipeline companies in the world, we compiled a list of the biggest global diversified oil and gas energy companies with the largest network of pipelines. We then proceeded to rank these companies in order of their market cap. For private companies, we have used a revenue multiple of 1.5x to come up with the estimated market value, which we think is a fair multiple for the industry.Largest Pipeline Companies in the World15.

87,ad1fc1ff-7575-357c-96f3-bf7c2af1d6cd,BA,2023-02-13,"With 50% ownership of the shares, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/50-ownership-shares-boeing-company-130030053.html,1676293230,STORY,['BA'],"[Every investor in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 50% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Boeing. View our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Boeing. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Boeing, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Boeing. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 5.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of BoeingWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Boeing Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$72m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Boeing. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Boeing (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

That means we need to ensure our customers have the narrowbody aircraft they need to serve this market,"" he said. (Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)]"

It also wants planes for aircraft carriers to balance China's growing power in the Indian Ocean.As the country prepares to host the Aero India show in Bengaluru from Monday, its airlines are expanding, with Air India expected to announce a potentially record deal to buy nearly 500 jets from Airbus SE and Boeing Co, worth more than $100 billion at list prices.IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier and a top Airbus client, could be next, with aviation consultant CAPA India predicting it will make a blockbuster order of a similar scale as Air India's.Indian carriers may buy 1,500 to 1,700 aircraft in coming years, CAPA said, including Air India and IndiGo.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to open the air show, which runs through Friday. It will be military-dominated but also feature India's efforts to accommodate a domestic travel boom and rebuild its brand abroad.Modi has made ""Make-in-India"" a centrepiece of his economic policy, insisting that manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing and Airbus share technology or make more than parts in the country.His government's push to expand the world's fifth-largest economy to $5 trillion by 2026 from $3.2 trillion in 2021 could mean more industrial supply deals.MILITARY, COMMERCIAL COMPETITION""The days of foreign companies selling directly to India are over,"" a defence industry source told Reuters. ""The narrative has moved as the Modi government wants Indian companies to manufacture in partnership with global firms.""Story continuesThe push for transfer of high technology and domestic manufacturing signals Modi's ambition to share the stage with military superpowers like the United States, Russia and China.At the same time, airlines like Air India are seeking to go head-on with rivals like Emirates Airline for a bigger share of international passenger flow. But many analysts warn recapturing traffic from established Gulf hubs will face tough competition.With manufacturers lining up for a slice of the multi-billion-dollar opportunity and the chance to partner with a rising power, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC has said it was ready to work with India on developing combat-aircraft engine technologies.New Delhi is trying to reduce its traditional dependence on Russia, turning to the United States, France and Israel for equipment and pushing its own Tejas light combat plane.The U.S. delegation will be the largest in the air show's 27-year history, said the embassy in New Delhi. ""As India modernises its defence capabilities, certainly we want to be the partner of choice.""India's pressing military air need is to shore up its fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 31 from the approved 42 as political and bureaucratic hurdles and lack of funds delay purchases. A $20-billion proposal to buy 114 multi-role fighter aircraft has been pending for five years, brought into sharp focus by tensions with China and Pakistan.The biggest military aircraft makers want in on such a deal, with attention on French Dassault Aviation SA's Rafale, Saab AB's JAS-39 Gripen, Boeing's F-15EX and F/A-18 Super Hornet, and Lockheed Martin's F-21 - an upgraded version of the F-16 unveiled at the India show in 2019.

92,260c8f27-38fa-3e34-9251-b0fbe43b77bf,NOC,2023-02-13,The 5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy (With Dividends) for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-best-defense-stocks-buy-210136114.html,1675976496,STORY,"['GD', 'LMT', 'CDRE', 'RTX', 'NOC']","[War is good business.The U.S. has been in a continuous state of war or war readiness since Dec. 7, 1941.While the war in Afghanistan ended for the U.S. in 2021, the United States is now the largest western supplier for the War in Ukraine, which began in earnest a year ago.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis has been very good for investors in defense stocks. While the Nasdaq is down 14% over the last two years, the biggest defense stocks are up an average of 40%. Most also pay fat dividends.War may be all hell, as William Tecumseh Sherman wrote. But it is phenomenally profitable. It’s one of the primary reasons America remains the world’s dominant power. America is quite good at it.Unsurprisingly then, the U.S. is also very good at running defense companies. When government funding lags, defense contractors merge around the latest technologies. When funding rises, the survivors control the resulting market growth.As an investor, you can do quite well with the usual defense suspects. But the best performer lately doesn’t make weapons at all. Here are the five best defense stocks to buy (with dividends) for February 2023.Best Defense Stocks for February: Cadre Holdings (CDRE)To defuse a bomb, military bulletproof vest, helmet, CDRE stockSource: The world of words / Shutterstock.comCadre Holdings (NASDAQ:CDRE), based in Jacksonville, Florida, makes safety and survivability equipment. Its brands include Safariland, which makes its body armor, Med-Eng, whose products protect soldiers and police from blasts, and Armor Systems.Armor CEO William Kanders led the investor group that bought Armor from European aerospace company BAE Systems (OTCMKTS:BAESY) in 2012 for $124 million. He still controls 77% of the stock, which came public in November of 2021. Cadre is now worth $853 million and Kanders serves as executive chairman. CDRE stock is up over 50% since its initial public offering (IPO).Since coming public, Cadre has made some small acquisitions, buying European holster company Radar Leather and chemical illumination company Cyalume. Both were said to be adding to earnings at the time of the deals.Story continuesCadre has big civilian markets as well as military contracts, protecting the first responders with body armor and other equipment. Cadre had sales of $111.5 million in the September quarter, on which it earned a net income of nearly $5 million, 13 cents per share. Operating cash flow came in at $29.5 million. For the December quarter analysts are expecting 21 cents per share of earnings and $115.7 million in sales. Those numbers are due on March 9.If you want growth in defense but don’t want to buy a weapons company, Cadre may be a good choice.Northrup Grumman (NOC)Szczecin,Poland-January 2022:Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk taking off from an airfield equipped with drone control equipment.3D Illustration.Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, Northrup Grumman (NYSE:NOC) stock is up 49%. It has also delivered $11.35 per share in dividends, a yield of 1.56% at its Feb. 7 price of $445 per share. And NOC’s dividend has increased during that time by 20%.Northrup Grumman turns every advance of Silicon Valley into defense equipment. Whether it’s artificial intelligence, robotics. or the latest chips, the company has an inside track on guaranteed profits from government contracts.Northrup Grumman gets 88% of its revenue from defense contracts and had $31.4 billion worth of them last year. In the December quarter, it turned 20% of $10 billion in revenue into net income. The company makes planes like the recently revealed B-21 stealth bomber, unmanned craft like the Global Hawk, and the back-end technology controlling them.A Goldman Sachs downgrade of the sector sent the stock plunging in January, despite management raising its sales forecast. Analysts are worried about whether the new B-21 stealth bomber can be profitable, and about Republican calls for defense spending cuts. One of the 15 analysts following the stock at Tipranks even has the sell light on.But hawks always have something to worry about, and the U.S. isn’t the only customer for what Northrup Grumman offers. You don’t have to rush into this stock, but you can accumulate it on weakness, set it aside, and see a long-term profit. It’s currently selling for just 14 times earnings.Best Defense Stocks for February: General Dynamics (GD)US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015Source: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stock is up 46%. It has delivered $9.80 per share in dividends and has a current yield of 2.17%. At its recent price of $228 per share, the company was worth over $62.5 billion, just over 1.5 times last year’s $39.4 billion in revenue.General Dynamics makes submarines, guided missile destroyers, and is best known today for the M1 Abrams tank. It also makes the Gulfstream business jet.General Dynamics was the 5th largest defense contractor last year, coming in behind Northrup Grumman with $30 billion of revenue. Nearly one-quarter of revenue came from outside defense, mainly from Gulfstream, but it is expanding in the non-defense market for supercomputers.However, it’s the Abrams, which Ukraine very much wants, that has been getting the headlines lately. The tank comes with lucrative service contracts. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) recently bought more shares, raising its stake in the company to 5.7%.Value investors like GD stock a lot, calling it a “wealth compounder.” Its January weakness doesn’t change the investment case, which is based on long-term dividend returns. The weaker the stock gets, the better that dividend will look. The company is good for it. Of 12 analysts now following General Dynamics stock at Tipranks, eight are saying buy it, and none are suggesting a sell.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is up 38%. It has delivered $22 in dividends during that time. It recently announced another $3 per share will be paid out to shareholders of record on Feb. 28. At $465 per share, it has a market capitalization of $119 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.5, and a current yield of 2.56%.Lockheed Martin is the nation’s largest defense contractor, with $61.5 billion in contracts during 2021.  It is also the contractor most dependent on the government with 97% of revenue coming from the Department of Defense.Lockheed makes the F-35 fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, and the AEGIS combat control system. It has contracts with NASA and other public and private space-focused entities. It has also developed hypersonic missiles, which can travel 25 times the speed of sound.The profits should keep rolling in, because Lockheed has a huge backlog of orders, especially for the F-16 fighter jet. It continues to have ties deep in the federal government. Johnathan Caldwell, general manager of its military space division, got an advisory appointment from the Biden administration this month.Analysts are more supportive of Lockheed Martin than its competitors. Credit Suisse recently moved it from a “sell” to a “buy” based on accelerating growth. This may be the first of several upgrades. Right now, the average Tipranks rating is a hold.Best Defense Stocks for February: Raytheon Technologies (RTX)A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house. Defense stocks.Source: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comOver the last two years, shares in Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) are up nearly 39%. During that time, it has also delivered $4.16 per share in dividends. At about $97 per share, it has a market cap of $144 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and a yield of 2.53%.Think of Raytheon as the military’s rocket men. It is a primary supplier to other defense contractors but also brings them in on some projects.Raytheon is best known for missiles, but it also makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and owns Collins Aerospace, which supplies the military with space assets. This has made it the second-largest military contractor, bringing in nearly $42 billion in 2021. That’s 65% of its total revenue, which came to $64 billion last year.Raytheon’s dominance in key rocket and space niches gives it a bright future, and not just in defense. Most of its profit gains are coming in from Collins or Pratt &amp; Whitney contracts outside defense.That’s because Pratt &amp; Whitney powers commercial airliners and the engines have a big aftermarket. The company delivered $4.9 billion in free cash flow last year, most of it in the fourth quarter, earning $1.4 billion, $1.27 per share, on $18 billion in revenue. Another dividend increase is likely. Of 13 analysts following Raytheon at Tipranks eight say buy it, and five are in the “hold” camp. None say “sell.”On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held no positions in any companies mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:PYPL)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)l: PayPal shares were a top detractor for 4Q, reporting slightly weaker than expected 3Q payment volumes and 4Q payment volume guidance. The company nevertheless reported betterthan-expected EPS on improved margins. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and 3Q results and 4Q guidance show early improvements in its margins and ability to drive higher cash flow growth in the near term. For 3Q, PYPL reported $1.8 billion of FCF, the highest quarterly FCF number in its history, representing 37% growth. The company expects continued operating margin expansion for 4Q and full year FCF of more than $5 billion, representing a 6% FCF yield.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is a key beneficiary of the ongoing shift to ecommerce driven digital payments, as well as consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-topeer (P2P) payment service. With a 3Q non-GAAP operating margin of 22%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of secular growth, expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel high teens earnings growth over the next five years.

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin might test $20,000 or below, but there's still reason to be bullish about the world's largest digital asset.Insights: The Securities and Exchange Commission's move against Kraken's staking program isn't an attack on staking as a whole.Prices:CoinDesk Market Index (CMI)1,031 −8.7 ▼ 0.8%  Bitcoin (BTC)$21,740 −118.9 ▼ 0.5%  Ethereum (ETH)$1,512 −25.7 ▼ 1.7%  S&amp;P 5004,090.46 +9.0 ▲ 0.2%  Gold$1,872 +9.4 ▲ 0.5%  Nikkei 22527,670.98 +86.6 ▲ 0.3%  BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)Bitcoin Is Seeking SupportHappy Monday.As Asia started the work week, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) fell to $21,750 and ether is down 1.8% to $1,514.Joe DiPasquale of BitBull Capital says that bitcoin is now making an “underside test” having already lost the $23K and $22K levels that will determine if it will reclaim the $23K mark or fall to $20K “rather quickly.”“The market is also reliant on macroeconomic developments, and given how December consumer prices were found to be higher than previously expected, the market may start to consider a bigger rate hike in the next FOMC,” he told CoinDesk in a note.In looking for support, bitcoin is also digesting regulatory developments. Last week, Kraken – but not Coinbase – was fined $30 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its staking program in the U.S. The Wall Street Journal also reports that Paxos is next on the SEC’s hit list as it targets the Binance USD stablecoin.“Regulations are also a concern for the crypto space, especially after the $30 million fine the SEC imposed on Kraken exchange,” DiPasquale said. “That being said, we believe it is better to get regulatory clarity in a slow market, as opposed to stricter developments during a full-fledged bull market.”Despite all this, DiPasquale said his firm remains bullish on bitcoin – even if it blows through support levels.Story continues“[We] would be looking to accumulate more if prices drop sub-$20,000.”Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL+2.7%Smart Contract PlatformShiba InuSHIB+0.4%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorLoopringLRC−5.3%Smart Contract PlatformDecentralandMANA−5.0%EntertainmentGalaGALA−4.3%EntertainmentInsightsEther Liquid Staking Platforms Will Benefit as SEC Actions Likely Fail to Knock Out DeFiCrypto exchange Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have settled over staking.The regulated Kraken exchange has to pay a $30 million penalty and immediately cease its U.S. service. But, more importantly, staking continues in the United States. Staking refers to locking tokens for a set period to help support the operation of a blockchain. Liquid staking, on the other hand, issues a derivative token that represents the amount of locked tokens to user, allowing them to access decentralized finance (DeFi) services such as lending and borrowing.The way Kraken offered staking was unique, which is why the exchange’s service was shuttered and the SEC didn’t go after Coinbase or make a move on decentralized liquid staking protocols.Central to the SEC’s statement is a lack of transparency on Kraken’s part. Yes, on-chain data shows that Kraken is one of the largest validators, operating a big staking pool. But the SEC seems to be concerned about fund flow: Is ether deposited into Kraken intended for staking really going to staking? Or is it being lent out?Liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool wouldn’t have that same problem. One could track their ether from their wallet into the pool via a block explorer or other chain monitoring tools.In the initial hours after the market learned about the SEC’s interest in going after staking, via a Brian Armstrong tweet, liquid staking tokens such as Lido’s LDO surged and surged again when Kraken’s U.S. staking shop closed its doors.A more reasonable explanation of the surge could come down to the SEC’s current ""Yellow Light"" towards staking. Staking as an investment strategy is not allowed, but staking as a technical service is.As crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro tweeted: “Validation-as-a-service is not like an ‘earn’ program, not like taking capital into a business or fund. It’s a ministerial tech service.”One thing that’s rather telling is that the total value locked of liquid staking protocols like Lido or Rocket Pool didn’t rise in the aftermath.Since the start of the year, the total value locked in Lido has remained stable: It began the year at 4.9 million ether on Jan. 1, and is now around 5.19 million ether. Rocket Pool staked ether rose from around 472,000 to 608,000 during the same time period.Click here to read the full article.Important events10:50 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:50 UTC) Japan Gross Domestic Product (QoQ)6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) United Kingdom Claimant Count Change (Jan) 6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) United Kingdom ILO Unemployment Rate (Dec)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Falls Below $22K Following Kraken's SEC SettlementBitcoin (BTC) sank below $22,000 after crypto exchange Kraken gears up to end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges concerning the offering of unregistered securities.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.Story continuesWith that, let me turn the call over to Dan.Daniel Schulman: Thanks, Gabs. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today's call. Well we obviously have a lot to cover in the next hour and I want to be sure we have plenty of time for your questions. So let me jump right into my remarks. In a difficult macroeconomic environment with the overall growth of e-commerce continuing to slow, we still managed to grow our 2022 revenues by 10% FXN to $27.5 billion. We grew our TPV by 13% FXN, with our branded checkout volumes growing in-line with global e-commerce growth. And we processed over $1.35 trillion of volume on our platform. Our non-transaction-related OpEx grew by 2.7% for the year, down from 20% growth last year as we operationalized the reduction of over $900 million in costs in both our transaction expense and non-transaction OpEx. And throughout the year, we drove 3,900 basis points of improvement in our non-GAAP EPS growth rate from negative 28% in Q1 to positive 11% in Q4.We returned $4.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, representing more than 80% of our free cash flow, which totaled $5.1 billion in 2022. In the quarter, we set several new milestones, and we returned to operating margin expansion and positive earnings growth. For the first time in our history, we exceeded $7 billion of revenue in the quarter, meeting our guidance of 9% FXN growth with the revenues of $7.4 billion. In addition, for the first time ever, we exceeded 6 billion transactions in a quarter, resulting in 51.4 transactions per active account growing 13% year-over-year. We delivered $1.24 in non-GAAP EPS, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance, as I mentioned, growing at 11%. The quarter was clearly a positive inflection point and is a direct result of our intense focus and cost discipline and the pursuit of profitable growth.I'm particularly pleased with the team's progress to rightsize our cost structure. For the quarter, our non-transaction-related OpEx declined year-over-year by 6%, and we are exiting the year with a run rate ahead of our planned $1.3 billion of savings in 2023. We grew our non-GAAP operating margin to 22.9%, up 115 basis points from a year ago and up sequentially for the second quarter in a row. As we look towards 2023, I want to lay out our thinking about the year ahead. First, we have identified an incremental $600 million of cost savings on top of the $1.3 billion of cost savings previously identified. This includes the very difficult decision to reduce our headcount by 7% as we continue to improve our processes and sharpen our focus. We will also continue to reduce our external vendor spend and real estate footprint.We now expect that non-transaction related OpEx for the full year will decline in the high single digits year-over-year, driving approximately 125 basis points of margin expansion and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth. The second point I want to make is that we have designed our cost structure and EPS growth targets based on what we believe to be a very conservative planning assumption of mid-single-digit FXN revenue growth rate in order to give high confidence in our ability to deliver our EPS. And the third and final point is that our actual revenue expectations are well higher than that planning assumption. As you can see from our Q1 guide of 9% FXN growth with Q1 non-GAAP EPS anticipated to grow by 23% to 25% to $1.08 to $1.10. I want to emphasize another point, and that is we are confident that our 2023 cost structure enables us to continue to fully invest in our high conviction growth initiatives.We are putting significant resources behind the modernization of our checkout experience in order to defend and grow our market share in our branded checkout business. This includes a drive towards passwordless, one click native in-app experiences as well as deploying the next generation of advanced checkout using our data and AI capabilities. Although this will be a multiyear initiative and will take time given the scale of our base and our legacy integrations, I am extremely pleased with the progress we made last year. We will continue to deliver scaled growth for Braintree. And last year, we made significant progress in modernizing our architecture and capabilities. These improvements resulted in a substantial number of new sales and incremental volume from existing accounts.In addition, we have an impressive pipeline of opportunity for 2023. In the first half of this year, we intend to fully ramp our unbranded offering to small and midsized businesses, either directly or through channel partners. The launch of PPCP, or PayPal Complete Payments, will meaningfully expand our unbranded total addressable market by as much as $750 billion, and enables us to drive incremental share with higher margins than our Braintree Enterprise service. On the consumer side, we'll continue to enhance our digital wallet value proposition. We are focused on the end-to-end customer experience, from onboarding to the entirety of the consumer life cycle, utilizing more advanced forms of AI to drive optimal consumer choices. In the past two years, we have introduced a significant number of products and services.For instance, our Buy Now Pay Later service is driving significant lifts in checkout and incremental TPV, and it's now one of the most popular Buy Now Pay Later services in the world. With almost 200 million loans to over 30 million consumers since launching in 2020 and with approximately 300,000 merchants putting our Buy Now Pay Later upstream on their product pages. We have introduced savings, bill pay, new forms of giving, more ways to send international remittances, new debit and credit cards, rewards and customized deals and offers, all within a single app, and we are now integrating these disparate services into what we hope will be a seamless user experience that is customized across both Venmo and PayPal with the ultimate goal of driving daily usage.We need to reestablish P2P as a core anchor for PayPal and Venmo. It is a key driver of usage and often establishes the amount of balance an individual consumer holds in their wallet. The more people store in their balance, the more they use checkout and the better our overall economics. We plan to meaningfully enhance the overall P2P experience, including revamping the onboarding experience, reducing declines and introducing more value-added capabilities. I'm proud of all the team has done to responsibly innovate. We've made significant strides in upgrading our legacy infrastructure and retiring our technical debt. Eight years ago, we were primarily a monolithic C++ stack. By the end of Q1, we will have completed a full payment stack replatforming, leveraging a modern architecture and the latest software engineering methods.We had record platform availability in 2022, and we put out approximately 80,000 software releases. Our increased productivity and focused efforts are enabling us to make significant progress every quarter in upgrading our merchant base to our most advanced checkout flows. In 2021, approximately 20% of our top 100 merchants were on our latest checkout experiences. At the end of 2022, one third of our top 100 were in our latest checkout integration. And in 2023, we are targeting to be approximately 50%. And despite an increasingly competitive environment, we are confident that in total, we continue to hold share across our core markets. As we look ahead to 2023, we've built our plan to assure proper staffing of our key initiatives. But we also know that we must have a mindset of continuous productivity, not just last year, not just this year, but in the years ahead.Still difficult to accurately assess how the year ahead will play out in terms of e-commerce growth. If you ask 20 experts, you get 20 different opinions. Our baseline assumption is that discretionary spend will remain under pressure, and global e-commerce growth will be slightly positive year-over-year. That said, we are seeing signs that inflation is beginning to cool, and it's logical to expect that discretionary spend versus non-discretionary spend will begin to increase. To be clear, we have not built any recent positive economic news into our forecasts. But as I mentioned, our Q1 is off to a much stronger start than we anticipated with branded checkout volumes accelerating nicely from Q4. Longer term, the secular tailwinds that have benefited our business have not changed.PayPal, Shopping, PayingPhoto by Mika Baumeister on UnsplashAnd we are confident that when e-commerce growth starts to turn and grow at more historical double-digit rates, we will be extremely well positioned to capitalize on that shift and drive even higher revenue growth with increased margins. Finally, I'd like to address my plans around CEO succession. As some of you have noted, I turned 65 last month, albeit I will say, a very young 65. The board and I discussed CEO succession multiple times a year. And that informed the board that I plan to retire from serving as the President and CEO of PayPal at the end of this year. I felt there were two important considerations in terms of timing. First, I wanted to be sure that PayPal had positive momentum and was in a position to deliver a solid year of performance.So I can be sure I wasn't leaving the company in a difficult position. And second, it was important to me that the Board have enough time to conduct a thorough search and have a reasonable transition period. In a global business as complex as PayPal, there are important relationships with government officials and regulators across the world, with the CEOs of our partners and with the CEOs of our customers, that will need to be thoughtfully transitioned. I feel that a year gives the board enough runway to find the next leader of PayPal and time for an orderly transition. Of course, I will be flexible in my time frame in order to assure we seamlessly onboard the ideal next leader of PayPal, and I look forward to continuing to serve on the PayPal board.I'm eager to see the next CEO build on all we have accomplished in the last eight and half years and seize the immense potential ahead of us. In the meantime, I will remain fully focused on maintaining our momentum and executing on our plan. Since our IPO, PayPal's stock price has outpaced the S&amp;P 500. And as you can see in our investor deck, our revenues, TPV, earnings and free cash flow have all tripled in size during that same time period. However, I feel confident that now is a time where our business has hit multiple positive inflection points. By the end of this year, we will have the appropriate cost structure to ensure that we deliver profitable growth with consistent and healthy non-GAAP EPS growth. And more importantly, we are confident we have the right road map in place to drive continued improvements in our customer experiences so that we remain a global leader in digital payments.In this current environment with so many of our competitors struggling to make money, we see a path to emerge from this economic downturn in a position of increased strength. We are quite encouraged as we look out at 2023 and beyond. I want to thank all of our employees for the outstanding work and passion they display every day. We still have a lot to accomplish, but we are finally at the point where 2023 can be a transformational year for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gab.Gabrielle Rabinovitch: Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us to deliver a solid quarter. The results we're reporting today demonstrate the strength, resilience and diversification of our business. We accelerated earnings growth on both a year-over-year and sequential basis despite ongoing pressure on e-commerce throughout our core markets. We continue to navigate this dynamic operating environment with strong discipline and a renewed focus on our key priorities. While the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we're energized by the significant opportunity we have to advance our leadership in payments and better serve our customers. We believe this is an environment where the strong will get stronger and where our scale, profitability and stability make us a partner of choice and a formidable competitor in the payments ecosystem.Our results reflect our efforts to manage our business with greater discipline and deliver operating margin expansion. Our ongoing savings efforts are resulting in sustainable efficiencies for our business. In addition, we're investing in our high-conviction growth initiatives to ensure that we emerge stronger from this period of economic uncertainty. We're proud of the quarter we delivered. Relative to the fourth quarter targets we shared with you in November, our non-GAAP EPS outperformed, and our revenue was in line. Importantly, the sequential improvement in our earnings growth continued. The fourth quarter was an inflection point as our non-GAAP operating margin expanded for the first time since the first quarter of 2021, marking a return to profitable growth.We have now established a solid foundation to build on these results. And in 2023, we plan to deliver meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion and a significantly stronger non-GAAP earnings profile. Before discussing our 2023 outlook, I'd like to highlight our fourth quarter performance. As Dan mentioned, revenue increased 9% on a currency-neutral basis and 7% at spot to $7.38 billion. This represents a three-year revenue CAGR of 14% and 19%, excluding eBay. Transaction revenue grew 5% to $6.7 billion, driven primarily by Braintree and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue grew 26% to $681 million. Relative to last year, this performance resulted from higher interest income on customer store balances and positive contributions from both our merchant and consumer credit products.In the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue grew 10% and international revenue grew 2% at spot. On a currency neutral basis, international revenue grew 6%. We had solid take rate performance. Transaction take rate was 1.88%, flat to last year, and total take rate improved 3 basis points to 2.07%. eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 31%, and the take rate on these volumes decreased to 1.95% from 2.29% in Q4 2021. This was offset by a 4-basis point increase on the rest of our volume. Transaction expense came in at 93 basis points as a rate of TPV, relative to 87 basis points of the rate last year. The increase in transaction expense as a rate was primarily driven by higher growth in unbranded processing volumes relative to other contributors to our payment volume mix.Transaction loss as a rate of TPV improved to 6 basis points versus 9 basis points last year. Our loss rate in the quarter benefited from the release of a portion of reserves related to recoveries from a merchant insolvency proceeding. This reserve was originally taken in the second quarter of 2022 and was a drag on that quarter's transaction loss performance. In addition, Venmo loss performance improved relative to the fourth quarter last year. Credit losses were $174 million, or 5 basis points as a rate of TPV. We ended Q4 with $7.4 billion in net receivables, reflecting 24% sequential growth. The growth in Buy Now, Pay Later receivables was the largest driver of loan origination. In 2023, we plan to externalize a meaningful portion of our Pay Later receivables portfolio, reducing our balance sheet exposure and securing a sustainable long-term funding partner for this part of our business.The mix of shorter duration originations from our Pay Later products and solid performance of our overall portfolio resulted in a reserve coverage ratio of 7.4%, flat sequentially and 180 basis points lower than the fourth quarter last year. In the aggregate, volume-based expenses increased 12%. This increase was more than offset by a 6% decline in our non-transaction-related expenses. Cost savings initiatives and efficiency gains contributed to this performance across all major expense categories. As a result of this discipline, non-GAAP operating income grew 12% to $1.69 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin reached 22.9%, expanding 115 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, for the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, growing 11% from Q4 '21 and marking the first quarter in 2022 that earnings per share grew on a year-over-year basis.We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.9 billion. During the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow, which resulted in $5.1 million of free cash flow generation in 2022. In the fourth quarter, we completed an additional $1 billion in share repurchase, which brings our capital return in 2022 to $4.2 billion, representing 82% of the free cash flow we generated. As noted last summer, we've taken a more aggressive approach to our capital return program over the past several quarters. We continue to believe that share repurchase remains an excellent use of capital for our shareholders. I would now like to discuss our outlook for 2023. For the first quarter, as Dan mentioned, we expect revenue to grow approximately 9% on a currency neutral basis and approximately 7.5% at spot to $6.97 billion.We also expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, representing growth of approximately 24%. The first quarter is off to a great start and sets us up well for the year ahead. We are encouraged by what we're seeing, but remain vigilant as there continues to be potential for variability as we move through 2023. Since the beginning of the pandemic, forecasting four quarters ahead has been especially challenging. And while the direct impact from COVID is now largely behind us, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain. The rate of e-commerce growth in our core markets has decelerated. Inflationary pressures have affected discretionary consumer spending and post-COVID spending patterns are still evolving. As a result, we're not providing guidance for full year revenue growth at this time.We will guide the quarter ahead and believe this is a responsible approach. As Dan indicated, for the full year, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to grow 18%. This is an increase from the outlook of 15% growth we discussed when we reported third quarter results. Relative to our prior expectations for the year, our forecasted tax rate increased, and we now expect the externalization of part of our Pay Later receivables portfolio to result in several cents of dilution. Offsetting these headwinds are benefits from additional cost savings, higher interest income, and from a shift from cash compensation to stock for a portion of our annual incentive plan, increasing share-based compensation. In putting together our financial architecture for the year and guiding 18% non-GAAP EPS growth, we have been prudent about our planning assumptions for our revenue performance and in establishing an efficient cost structure that enables us to deliver on this commitment.We believe we can deliver 18% earnings growth even with revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a currency-neutral basis. That said, our objective is to grow revenue ahead of this baseline. Our revenue growth is highly correlated to discretionary e-commerce spending in our core markets. We are optimistic that when e-commerce growth reaccelerates, we will fare better than most. In addition, our framework contemplates as much as a high single-digit decline in non-transaction-related expenses on a year-over-year basis. Over the past year, we significantly increased the operational rigor with which we run our business. We've sharpened our focus on strategic priorities, strengthened our planning process and increased our discipline with respect to capital allocation.We've also begun to realize benefits from cost savings initiatives. We are continuing our work removing complexity within our organization. We believe we are on track with streamlining and resetting our cost base and essentially putting ourselves back on a pre-pandemic trajectory with respect to our non-transaction-related expense profile relative to our growth. Accordingly, we believe we're well positioned to scale more profitably and sustainably going forward. I'd also like to share more on our expectations for foreign exchange. Our revenue guidance for the first quarter contemplates an approximate 150 basis point headwind from FX. Foreign exchange rates, we expect an approximate 1-point headwind to full year revenue growth. In addition, as we have discussed, we're prioritizing engagement.We have approximately 190 million monthly active unique users on our platform today. Increasing the activity and engagement level of these users, converting new ones and driving more daily use is one of our greatest opportunities. While we will continue to track and report on our active accounts each quarter, we will no longer guide net new active accounts. Given our strategic focus, we do not expect total active accounts to grow in 2023. That said, we have confidence that our monthly active unique user base will be stable to growing. Finally, in 2023, we expect to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow. We plan to continue our aggressive posture towards capital return and allocate approximately 75% of our free cash flow to share repurchase in 2023.In closing, we're pleased with the progress we're making across many fronts and with our momentum. Our team is working tirelessly to serve our customers, advance our strategic priorities and improve our cost structure. The cash flow generating power of our business is a competitive differentiator and gives us a high degree of flexibility as we allocate capital with discipline. Whatever macroeconomic conditions we face, we will continue to deepen our focus, invest in innovation in our people for the long term and strengthen our competitive advantages. We look forward to sustainably delivering long-term profitable growth and creating value for our shareholders. Before I pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&amp;A portion of the call, I'd like to give an update on our plans for the year.Later this year, we will host a meeting for the investment community to provide an update on our strategic road map and introduce you to more of our leadership team. We're targeting the latter part of Q2, and we'll share more as we get closer. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Pipeline Companies in the World.Global Energy Monitor estimates that as of December 2020, there were at least 2,381 active oil and gas pipelines spread over 162 nations. The total length of these pipes exceeds 1.18 million km, which is enough to circle the Earth 30 times. The pipeline sector is part of the “midstream” oil industry, and according to Mordor Intelligence, it is forecasted to register a CAGR of more than 6.5% by 2027.Global Data claims that Asia will lead the world in terms of pipeline length expansion, adding 58,021 km to its oil and gas pipeline network by 2026. North America and Europe come in second and third, with pipeline lengths forecasted to be 20,022 km and 17,151 km, respectively, by 2026. The growth in pipeline length does not mean that the sector is not facing any challenges. The anti-pipeline movement poses the most serious threat to pipeline firms. The movement is against the pipeline industry due to the negative effects of carbon fuels on the environment. The movement is gaining traction, from the protests against Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 to the more recent protests against the construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline in 2022. Reacting to the trend, many of the large pipeline firms have begun to create clean energy portfolios. These include Canada’s biggest pipeline company, Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), which has been expanding its offshore wind portfolio.Largest Pipeline Companies in the WorldPipeline in industrial districtLast year, the pipeline industry was thrust under the spotlight as a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Russia is Europe's principal supplier of natural gas. Russia supplied 45% of the EU's natural gas imports in 2021. The Russian SOE and its largest pipeline company, Gazprom, operates the majority of the gas pipelines, including Nord Stream. An episode of pipeline politics followed in February 2022 when Germany stopped the certification process for Nord Stream 2. This gas pipeline was designed to double the flow of Russian gas to Germany, so its closure has the potential to create significant losses for Russia.Story continuesIn September 2022, a series of explosives damaged at least 50 meters of the Nord Stream pipeline. Gazprom had cut off gas supplies prior to the attack, citing technical problems, but after the attack, the west accused Russia of organizing the bombings.In such challenging times, marked by concerns over war and climate change, it will be interesting to observe how these pipeline behemoths retain their growth.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 15 largest pipeline companies in the world, we compiled a list of the biggest global diversified oil and gas energy companies with the largest network of pipelines. We then proceeded to rank these companies in order of their market cap.

(NASDAQ:UAL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last quarter. But that doesn't help the fact that the three year return is less impressive. Truth be told the share price declined 39% in three years and that return, Dear Reader, falls short of what you could have got from passive investing with an index fund.If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for United Airlines Holdings isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, United Airlines Holdings moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too.Revenue is actually up 5.1% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. It's probably worth investigating United Airlines Holdings further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think United Airlines Holdings will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that United Airlines Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.0% over the last year. That certainly beats the loss of about 5% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand United Airlines Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with United Airlines Holdings , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

According to a study conducted by Northwestern Mutual, Americans expect that they need approximately $1.25 million to retire comfortably. This figure shows a 20% growth from the $1.05 million recorded in 2021. Another data from Natixis Investment Managers shows that 58% of the high net worth individuals mentioned that they’ll have to extend their working years instead of retiring at the age of 63.Retirees around the world search for ways to increase their earnings through investments as inflation notched its highest mark in nearly 40 years. In this regard, the Social Security Administration provided relief to retirees with the announcement of increasing benefits by 8.7% this year to weather this inflationary environment, as reported by Bloomberg. Through this increase, the average retiree benefit has grown to $1,827 per month, up $146 from the last year. However, with average annual household expenses for ages 65-74 of approximately $53,000, these social security benefits are not sufficient to cover living expenses smoothly. For this purpose, retiree investors are showing a renewed interest in the stock market, loading up steadily on dividend stocks.Historical analysis of dividend stocks shows that these securities generated stable returns for shareholders over the years. According to a paper published by Jefferson Research, dividend stocks accounted for 85% of the market’s total returns from 1926 to 2010. The paper also cited Goldman Sachs’ 2013 report which mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 9.6% through this period with a 16.2% volatility. Whereas, the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.1% with a volatility of 18%.Story continuesStocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

(NYSE:JEF) is a New York-based multinational independent investment bank that provides related financial services to its consumers. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.07%, as of February 9.

(NYSE:JEF) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor, and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”29. Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)24. Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Bad debt expense is likely to rise from the unusually low levels we’ve been experiencing, but we believe the company is well-positioned to absorb this normalization.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intuitive Surgical's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Intuitive Surgical's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 12% seen over the past five years by Intuitive Surgical.We then compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 17% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks.Despite a population of just 3.7 million people, if all U.S. states were countries, Connecticut would be the 67th largest country in the world, bigger than Finland, Czech Republic, Portugal and New Zealand, with a 2021 GDP of nearly $300 billion.Connecticut has been a manufacturing state since the colonization era, with its factories providing stiff competition to those in England. Through the decades, the state has given the world many new inventions including steamboats, lollipops, corkscrews and vulcanized rubber among others. This is why you will also see manufacturing companies among the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. Meanwhile, insurance companies are also a huge contributor to the state's economy with Connecticut being known as an insurance state for close to 200 years now. Agriculture may not have the same influence it did in previous centuries, but it is also still an important contributor to the economy of the state.25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocksSean Pavone/Shutterstock.comEven though Connecticut had the highest per capita personal income of any state in 2013, it also had the second-largest disparity in income between the top 1% and the bottom 99%, which showed a high level of inequality and standard of living for people in the state. Currently, Connecticut's unemployment rate is 4.2%, with only 11 states recording worse unemployment rates. This is still a significant improvement from November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.2% while the pre-pandemic unemployment rate was 3.4% in February 2020. Even though the unemployment rate is relatively high, the state has seen ten consecutive months of job growths but still trails the national average.Like most states in the U.S., Connecticut provides significant support to businesses in the state to encourage more companies to incorporate or initiate in the state and possibly even join the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. These incentives include providing grant-in-arrears equal to the value of 25% of withholding taxes from net new employees for eligible companies which have at least 25 employees. Specific eligible employers can receive a grant of up to 50% and these grants are available for up to 9 years. The state also operates tax credit programs which provide nonrefundable corporate income tax credits to eligible companies who invest at least $5 million in facilities in eligible areas. Meanwhile, several tax exemptions can also be availed based on specific situations including sales and use tax exemption, real and personal property tax exemption, and data center tax exemptions. In addition, businesses located in an enterprise zone could be eligible for ""an abatement on real and business personal property taxes of up to 80% for 5 years and a 10-year, 25% tax credit on the portion of the Connecticut corporation business tax that is directly attributable to the company relocation, expansion or renovation project. The credit may increase to 50% based on the number of new jobs created.""Story continuesThe 20 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks have combined revenues of around $420 billion and a market cap of around $550 billion.

It plans to store the gas or transport it to consumers on exisitng and a minority of new gas grids.Europe's biggest economy aims to eventually replace natural gas, especially that from Russia, and create a new value chain for green hydrogen that it expects to be drawing from imports and domestic production.The Oehringen ""hydrogen island"", an area in a town near Heilbronn with detached family homes, has been receiving a mix of natural gas plus gradually more hydrogen from its pipeline operator Netze BW - a subsidiary of utility EnBW - since autumn 2022.Netze's adjacent regional offices in Oehringen got the blends ahead of the homes, reaching a 30% mix already last summer.""Within the next two weeks, we will raise the share from 8% to 20% and two weeks further on, we will get to 30% in the households,"" project leader Heike Gruener told Reuters during a visit.The blending happens on the Netze BW site, using bought-in renewable power which is put through an electrolysis plant.The company wanted to show that the pipeline infrastructure and boilers, radiators and hobs can adapt to the mix without major replacements or adjustments. It said it hoped to demonstrate that repurposing Germany's huge gas infrastructure to serve homes and industry could work.Story continues""Of course we are looking to show that 100% hydrogen can work also. But that will only be roughly in the middle of this decade,"" Gruener added.Germany can capitalise on experiences well into the 1970s with town gas, made by burning coal and containing up to 50% hydrogen, she added.""There is no noticeable difference to 100% gas,"" said Andreas Frasch, a pensioner who participates in the tests.

One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.Despite the increase in feedgas flows to Freeport, U.S. gas futures fell about 5% on Monday, putting the contract on track to close at a 25-month low.That is because the gas market was more focused on a decline in domestic demand for the fuel for heating with the weather expected to remain mostly warmer than normal for the rest of February.Story continuesFULL OPERATIONS STILL MONTHS AWAYOn Saturday, Texas residents grilled U.S. energy regulators over their supervision of Freeport and other LNG plants.Bryan Lethcoe, a regional director at the U.S. Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), said it would take ""a number of months"" for Freeport to return to full operation.That is similar to the ""mid-March or later"" timeframe many energy analysts have projected for Freeport's full return.Officials at Freeport had no comment.A couple of Freeport's customers - Japan's JERA and Osaka Gas - have said they do not expect to get LNG from the plant until after March.Freeport's other big buyers include units of BP PLC, TotalEnergies and SK E&amp;S.BP's Kmarin Diamond was the first vessel to pick up LNG at Freeport since the plant shut.The tanker, which has already left the facility and is on its way to the Suez Canal in Egypt, picked up LNG to create space in Freeport's storage tanks for new LNG expected to be produced.There is already another vessel at the plant - Prism Agility - operated by South Korea's SK E&amp;S, according to Refinitiv and other ship tracking data.

However, when it comes to taking the next step in their relationship, 63% of people who have moved in with a romantic partner said that their decision was impacted by finances and/or logistics. Realtor.com® and HarrisX surveyed 3,009 consumers to highlight how today's expensive housing market is impacting people's love lives.""Living with a romantic partner might bring a couple closer together, but it can also magnify potential issues in a relationship,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor, Realtor.com®. ""While the idea of splitting the rent or mortgage can be very attractive, it's important to have tough conversations with your partner and think through how living together will work before you take the plunge.""Younger respondents were significantly more likely to be persuaded by money/logistics with 80% of Gen Z and 76% of Millennials saying that one or both of these things were a factor in moving in with a romantic partner. This is compared to 56% of Gen X, 44% of Baby Boomers who said the same thing.Will you be my… roommate?Unsurprisingly, among those who factored finances and/or logistics into their decision to move in with a partner, Gen Z respondents (56%) – who have faced notoriously high housing costs in their lifetime – were the most likely to say that saving money by splitting the rent/mortgage was a contributing factor. Additionally, 70% of all respondents who have moved in with a partner reported that they were able to save money by moving in. The most common amounts saved per month were:$1- $500 (27%)$501 - $1,000 (20%)$1,001 - $2,000 (13%)$2,001 - $5,000 (6%)More than $5,000 (4%)A significant percentage of respondents who have moved in with a partner moved into a home that one person already rented (37%) or owned (21%), while 30% decided to start fresh with a new rental and 9% took the leap directly into buying a home together.Story continuesDon't go breaking my heartNot all relationships work out and living with a partner isn't always easy. Forty-two percent of people who have moved in with a romantic partner ended up regretting the move. Reasons included:The relationship didn't work out (48%)We moved too fast/rushed the decision (31%)Realized we weren't compatible for co-living (27%)It made it harder to break up (26%)When we broke up it was stressful to divide the things that we had purchased together (22%)The stress of living together hurt our relationship (22%)The logistics of moving out after a breakup were too difficult (19%)We broke up soon after moving in together (17%)""When you're renting or purchasing real estate together, it's important to make sure you're both financially protected,"" said Trapasso. ""For example, if you're buying a home together as an unmarried couple, it may be a good idea to chat with a real estate attorney first to figure out what would happen with the home in the event that you broke up.""Will you accept this contract?Nearly a third (31%) of survey respondents who have moved in with a partner signed a contract outlining what would happen in the event of a break-up. Younger respondents were significantly more likely to have signed a contract, with 54% of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials doing so. This suggests that younger generations might be more financially and/or legally savvy and understand the importance of protecting their investments.MethodologyThe survey was conducted online from Feb. 1-4, 2023 among 3,009 adults in the U.S. by HarrisX.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The stock market bloodbath that started in 2022 has forced investors to shun the so-called growth companies that have nothing to show in terms of cash or tangible short-term value. That’s because investors tend to flee risky assets towards safe, value plays that can offer them safety and a refuge from volatility during difficult times. Value underperformed growth from 2007 until 2020. But the era of growth dominance seems to have ended. In a report titled Value vs. Growth Investing: Value returns with a Vengeance, JPMorgan analysts said that from 2007 through 2020 value underperformed in all sectors and asset classes. This underperformance reached its peak in 2020. The report said that as the world moved online after the pandemic, innovation and growth saw a lot of traction. The report highlights that this was the time when the markets made the same mistake as they did during the “TMT bubble” by “boosting future normalized growth rates”.The JPMorgan report says that by the end of 2020, “expectations became divorced from reality” as many software and growth companies’ valuations touched unprecedented highs.The report mentioned Tesla, Facebook and other growth companies as examples of huge valuations that were not connected with reality.""Amazon and Microsoft are undoubtedly great companies, but if you had bought them at the height of the TMT bubble in December 1999, it would have taken 10 years and 15 years, respectively, to break even. Valuation – no matter how good the company is – matters, even in the long term.""JPMorgan analysts believe value has been out of fashion for so long that many investors today aren’t used to a value-led market and they are only accustomed to small market rallies that last ""only six to nine months.”Story continues“All of this indicates that we are in for a reckoning that has only just begun.”Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the Dow 30 group of companies and picked the stocks that have a PE ratio of under 20 as of February 10.

CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

(NYSE:AIRC) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 10, 2023Operator: Welcome, and thank you for attending today's AIR Communities Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alexis, and will be your moderator for today's call. I would now like to pass the conference over to Lisa Cohn, President and General Counsel of AIR Communities. You may proceed.Lisa Cohn: Thank you, Alexis, and good day. My name is Lisa Cohn and as Alexis said, I am the President and General Counsel of AIR Communities. During this conference call, forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, among other things, current market conditions, macroeconomic trend, socioeconomic drivers, including projections related to 2023 performance expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release published on AIR's website.Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our CEO; Keith Kimmel, President of Property Operations; John McGrath, Co-CIO and Chairman of our Investment Committee; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are also present. All of us will be available during the question-and-answer session, which will follow our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?Terry Considine: Thank you, Lisa, and welcome to all of you on this call. AIR was designed to be the most efficient way to invest in public ownership of multi-family properties. The past year provides this confirmation. At 74%, AIR operating margins are the highest among our peers. At 67%, AIR has by far the highest rate of conversion of revenue into free cash flow. The highest among our peers and 10% higher than peer average. And for your information is posted on our web page and you might be interested to review the calculation. One foundation is the prowess of Keith and his ops team. Like other apartment owners, rent growth last year was good. AIR same-store revenue was up more than 10%. But unlike all other owners that I know AIR's COE, Controllable Operating Expenses actually declined by 10 basis points in the most inflationary economy of the past 40 years.Story continuesHow does Keith do it? A second foundation is the portfolio management of John McGrath. Roughly 3 times is active in the past two years as the average apartment REIT. John and his team sold 21% of our starting assets and purchased about $2 billion of acquisition assets. The acquisition Class of 2021 increases the overall same-store NOI growth rate by about 100 basis points. The Class of 2022 about the same size, it's outside the same-store portfolio, and has net operating income growing at faster than 20%, approximately 2.5 times the growth rate of the same-store properties. A good example of the consistency of AIR ops can be seen in the fourth quarter in January and now February leasing activity, and without the seasonal slowdown others faced.A good example how AIR paired trades improved portfolio quality and revenue growth can be seen in John's fourth quarter trade of 50-year-old Garden apartments in the outer suburbs of Boston, for an almost new mid-rise in dynamic Miami Beach. It also shows how we like to invest on Highland, where zoning or neighborhoods or mother nature make a location attractive to high-quality residents and is protected in some part from competitive new supply. Good ops and dynamic portfolio management, combined with Paul's balance sheet with little floating rate debt and Lisa's disciplined oversight of off-site activities in costs, makes for growth and the greatest efficiency of any public apartment REIT in converting revenue to free cash flow. Looking to 2023, this year, we plan for more of the same.Keith and his team will select the best residents and then work hard to satisfy and retain them. John - Josh and John Stein will look for acquisitions whose returns magnified by the AIR Edge are accretive to AIR's cost of capital. Paul will keep score and our balance sheet safe with low leverage long maturities, limited interest rate exposure and abundant liquidity. And Lisa will develop our precious human capital, manage risk, upgrade corporate systems, most important Gardner priced culture. They're conflicting views about what to expect from the economy this year. I note that the stock market and the bond market are pointing in different directions. AIR is prepared for both. If inflation continues higher and longer, AIR customers can afford higher rents, and Keith has proven decent control costs.If the Fed raises interest rates, their bottom line is little affected because Paul has only 4% of borrowings and floating rate debt. If the economy turns down, AIR is resilient with residents with high credit scores, incomes averaging $225,000 in the latest quarter and a greater than 60% propensity to renew. If the transaction markets prove difficult, John and Josh have demonstrated their ability to source capital from property sales and to invest in properties with big upsides when added to the AIR platform. I note that Paul's guidance assumes no increase in market rents and yet results in same-store net operating income up almost 9%, and FFO up 10% over last year's run rate FFO. It's not guidance and only my opinion, but I expect inflation to linger and net rents in our portfolio may grow faster than we expect.I'm optimistic about AIR's future. Efficiency and effectiveness provide comparative advantage in operations and acquisitions. We are a veteran team committed to continuous improvement and to each other. Our intentional culture makes AIR a great place to work. I take pride in its regular recognitions and National Top Workplace Award is the most recent. I look forward to the opportunities of this year and appreciate my teammates for their exceptional work last year. I thank Tom Keltner, Chairman of the AIR Board, and my fellow Directors for their engagement and good counsel, I'm grateful to shareholders. We work hard to be good stewards of your precious capital. With no more, I'll turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Head of AIR Op. Keith?Keith Kimmel: Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report we wrapped up a good 2022 with a solid fourth quarter. On today's call, I will cover: AIR's operations, which have had a more positive trajectory over the past four months than multi-family in general; AIR's acquisitions, a second portfolio that drives elevated growth as we apply the AIR Edge; and AIR's revenue outlook, which is highest amongst our peer group and based solely on facts and evidence today. Now to the details. First, the core business continues to do well. Revenue was up 9.9% from last year and the sequential growth of 1.8% made it the fastest-growing fourth quarter in our history. We saw rate growth in double-digits, with signed blended lease rates up 10.2% during the quarter.Occupancy increased each month from 96.7% in October to 97.4% in December. January further improved with occupancy of 97.5% and rate strengthening sequentially. Second, AIR Edge is a unique predictable advantage. While AIR Edge is comprised of a multitude of innovations, I boil it down to a single concept, consistency. It is consistency of resident selection, ensuring we have the highest income requirements, credit standards and resident quality. It is consistency of customer service. Our teams deliver day in and day out, relishing the opportunity to provide a world-class experience. Our residents scored us over 4.25 on satisfaction surveys in the fourth quarter, leading to our trailing 12 month turnover of only 38.9%. It is consistency of execution and innovation delivered by a talented and seasoned on-site team, bolstered by a platform of technology, process and centralized support.As a result, fourth quarter expenses were down 10 basis points year-over-year and controllable operating expenses were down 30 basis points. And it is consistency that is the key to AIR's operating margin. We established a new high watermark, achieving 76.1% in the quarter. Third, AIR has a proven track record of above-trend growth and acquired properties, what we call the AIR Edge portfolio, which will generate long-term outperformance. The great work of John and his team has positioned us in superior submarkets with higher rents, higher quality customers and higher upside for growth. For our AIR Edge Class of 2021, both revenue and NOI have grown about 50% faster than our same-store communities in the fourth quarter. We project these communities to grow at twice the same-store pace in 2023 as the AIR Edge continues to lead to both additional revenue and expense decreases.The contribution of the AIR Edge at these communities is worth about an additional 100 basis points to the same-store growth rate. Our acquisition Class of 2022 is on a similar trajectory. These communities are ahead of our underwriting and are expected to grow significantly faster than our stable portfolio of communities. Fourth, 2023 has the makings of another good year. Our revenue growth of 8% is a direct result of three facts and evidence today. AIR has 5% earned in from leasing activity in 2022. Our 5% loss to lease today will contribute 2% growth in '23, and our program of upgrading apartment homes will drive another 1%. Those three factors, none of which rely on market rate growth, will result in an 8% increase in AIR's revenue. Occupancy is anticipated to be 96.9%, flat from last year, with January occupancy of 97.5%, continued strength in February and robust demand, which is 10% ahead of 2022.Bad debt is expected to improve. Excluding the noise of repayments and delays, the run rate of bad debt is around 50 basis points. Residents are increasingly paying rent on time. And in the cases that they don't, our options for collections are returning to pre-COVID norms. At the beginning of 2022, we had 1,000 residents more than two months delinquent, and today, that is down to 250. Of those residents, a vast majority are now in the collections process. The final input to '23 revenue is market rate growth. And while we don't have a crystal ball, here's what I do know. Rates have strengthened this year as we have increased asking rents by $40 or 1.5% thus far in '23. In total, we are projecting 8% revenue growth based on 8% rate growth that we can directly see today, flat occupancy and no additional market rate growth.Real estate, Apartments, BuildingsPhoto by Tolga Ulkan on UnsplashNow look at it another way. We can view 2023 revenue growth through second lens. In most markets, our outlook is in the mid-single-digit revenue growth. We add to that the benefit of our market allocation, AIR's portfolio is over 20% allocated to South Florida, where earning alone is in the double-digits, and we anticipate growth in the high teens. Finally, we had the benefit of John's refresh of our portfolio. Our 2021 AIR Edge portfolio now entering our same-store population is expected to see revenue growth in the mid-teens. In the way we look at it, AIR a clear path to strong revenue growth in 2023. My thanks to all the AIR team members for a fantastic year. Their consistent attention to our residents and communities has set us up for a great shared success in 2023 and beyond.And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John McGrath, the Chairman of our Investment Committee.John McGrath: Thank you, Keith. We are focused on repositioning the AIR portfolio for disciplined portfolio management and accretive capital allocation. Since the separation from Aimco, $4.1 billion of transactions or approximately 41% turnover of GAV, about 3 times the turnover of our peers has transformed our portfolio in terms of value, growth, risk and quality. We have recycled capital into higher quality properties and higher gross markets, materially reduce exposure to markets with greater regulatory and political risk and an uncertain rule of law. Continue to improve our capital allocation, including diversification by market and price point and improve the quality of our portfolio as measured by expected rent growth, average rents, age and physical condition.And we increased the allocation of GAV to our high-growth AIR Edge portfolio from 0 to over 17% today. As shown in the supplemental schedules of the earnings release, during 2022, we furthered our goal of continuously improving portfolio quality by selling 18 of our lower-rated properties, which were located in slower growing markets with high regulatory exposure, had average rents 20% below our portfolio average and whose average effective age was about two-thirds older than that of the portfolio. We also allocated $840 million of capital in 2022 and another $298 million in January 2023 to neighborhoods that exhibit high growth due to durable demand factors and have constraints on competitive supply. These accretive acquisitions were match funded and are earning an attractive spread over the unlevered equity cost of capital.Turning to 2023. Market uncertainty and volatility have changed the calculus. However, therein lies the opportunity. During the recent boom times, cheap money and over-speculation attracted investments from every corner. As the market downturn set in, investor sentiment sourced, competitors were forced to pull back and buyer pools became shallow. An elevated cost of capital made it harder for buyers to make deals pencil, sidelined levered investors and forced others to take a cautious view of the future. As a result, transaction volumes are well off peak levels, driving uncertainty of pricing and a widening of bid-ask spreads as many sellers hesitate at the change pricing and choose to wait for greater clarity or better days. To be sure, uncertainty makes it tough.But our experience, economic downturns present a tremendous opportunity for profitable growth. AIR is well positioned to invest through a downturn and capitalize on the opportunities being presented and these exciting, albeit uncertain times. We have comparative advantage in transactions market due to our ability to generate enhanced returns through non-market advantages such as Paul's balance sheet, which is safe, secure and flexible, with ample liquidity and access to all sources of capital. The ability to use non-market currencies, such as OP units, to provide significant tax advantages and greater after-tax cash proceeds Incidentally, we use OP units in 50% of our acquisitions, which Paul neutralizes by repurchase of AIR shares. And most importantly, the AIR Edge, simply put, properties are worth more in Keith's hands.As I've stated on past calls, errors in the spread business, and we will continue to execute a capital allocation strategy that utilizes our paired trade philosophy. Paired trades improve both portfolio quality and rental growth rates and allow us to be relatively agnostic to market volatility while also establishing the cost and availability of our equity capital. Consistent with our strategy in November, we locked in an attractive cost of capital by closing the sale of six 50-year-old Garden apartment properties in outer suburbs of Boston. The proceeds from the sale were used to fund the $298 million acquisition of Southgate Towers in January. Southgate, which has got rehabbed in 2016, is located a few blocks away from our Flamingo assets in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach.The acquisition improves the quality of our portfolio by recycling capital into a high-quality asset located in a high-growth, supply-constrained and regulatory-friendly submarket. Like our cost of '21 and '22 acquisitions, which are performing well ahead of underwriting, the investment in Southgate is expected to be accretive and earnest spread over the cost of capital of 200 basis points or more. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue to source and execute similar trades whose returns magnified by the AIR Edge will be highly accretive to our cost of capital. However, given market uncertainty, we have no fixed goal for additional acquisitions in 2023. While Keith is rightfully optimistic, when buying, I take a more cautious view.Growth for the sake of growth is not a strategy I advocate. We will look to continue investing in neighborhoods and addresses that are attractive to high-quality residents and have some protection from competitive new supply. Despite having a cautious disposition, I remain bullish on our 2023 growth prospects. AIR's future investments, irrespective of the economic climate in which they are made, are expected to be highly accretive and an attractive spread over the equity cost of capital within the company's leverage policies and be built upon the company's solid operational foundation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?Paul Beldin: Thank you, John. Today, I will discuss AIR strong and flexible balance sheet, full year 2022 results, our expectations for 2023 and conclude with a brief comment on our dividend. AIR's balance sheet is well positioned for a period of economic uncertainty, including today's unsettled interest rate environment. First, leverage is low. Leverage EBITDA is 6.05:1, and variance to our target range of 5 times to 6 times of some $26 million as a result of the timing of share repurchases, which I'll discuss further in a moment. In 2023, we anticipate the leverage to EBITDA levels will vary from quarter-to-quarter, but our year-end target range remains unchanged. Second, liquidity is ample, with well over $800 million now available under our revolving credit facility.Third, we have limited repricing risk and limited exposure to floating interest rates. Subsequent to year end and on a leverage-neutral basis, we borrowed $320 million for 10 years at a fixed rate of 4.9%. Proceeds were used to refinance our sold debt maturity before May 2025 and to reduce borrowings by $230 million on our revolving credit facility. This transaction reduced floating rate debt to $150 million or 4% of total leverage and increased our weighted average maturities by nine months. The quality of the balance sheet is not just my opinion Moody's issued a Baa2 issuer credit rating, supplementing our BBB flat rating from S&amp;P. With two investment-grade ratings, we have access to the full suite of debt capital markets. We have access to the public and private bond markets, the bank debt market and non-recourse property-level debt.Now turning to full year 2022 results. Full year FFO was $2.41 per share, inclusive of a $0.22 contribution from a now repaid Aimco note. Last spring, we decided to allow prepayment on the note to delever and extend debt maturities, all while lowering our engagement with Aimco to advance the separation begun the year before. When we announced the prepayment, we provided guidance for run rate FFO that is FFO exclusive of the contribution from the Aimco note expected to be $2.19 per share. Full year 2022 run rate results delivered that 2019 run rate. In same-store operations, we outperformed our expectations, with full year same-store NOI growth up 14%, 200 basis points ahead of our beginning of year expectations. Revenue was up 10.2%, and operating expenses were up only 40 basis points.Furthermore, controllable operating expenses were down 10 bps, a remarkable achievement in a year when the CPI increased 6.5%. Outside same-store, a 21 acquisitions did even better, with fourth quarter growth rate in NOI almost 50% higher than in the same-store pool. We used our strong balance sheet and abundant liquidity to take advantage of the stock market doldrums to repurchase a total of 8 million shares, 5% of our shares outstanding at the start of the year at an average price of $39.49 and an expected IRR of approximately 10%. These repurchases are inclusive of 654,000 shares repurchased in November and December to neutralize the OP units issued in connection with the January acquisition of Southgate. As we look forward to 2023, we expect FFO per share at the midpoint will be $2.41, up 10% from 2022's run rate FFO of $2.19 million.We expect this growth to be the result of a $0.24 addition from 8.8% NOI growth in the same-store pool, inclusive of an approximate 100 basis point benefit due to the inclusion of the faster-growing Class of 2021 properties, partially offset by a $0.02 subtraction due primarily to the combination of NOI loss due to property sales and higher interest expense from a combination of earning of higher interest rates from 2022 financing activities and higher average outstanding balances, partially offset by benefits from incremental contribution from our 2022 acquisitions, the January acquisition of Southgate and a net $0.02 benefit from share repurchases. Finally, a few quick comments on our dividend. This refreshed tax basis continues to result in a taxpayer-friendly dividend.In 2022, AIR's dividend of $1.80 per share with 86% taxable at capital gains rates and 14% at ordinary income rates. For those investors who are tax-sensitive, each dollar of the AIR dividend was worth 39% more after tax than was the peer average. In 2023, we anticipate our dividend will continue to be the most tax efficient of the multi-family peer group. With that, we will now open up the call for questions.

126,918a1682-3bd8-3cfa-8339-5c744194711b,NVDA,2023-02-13,NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-seems-debt-120044962.html,1676289644,STORY,['NVDA'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA What Is NVIDIA's Net Debt?As you can see below, NVIDIA had US$11.0b of debt, at October 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But it also has US$13.1b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$2.19b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$6.86b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.3b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$13.1b and US$4.91b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$1.09b.Having regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$523.3b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, NVIDIA also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesOn the other hand, NVIDIA's EBIT dived 15%, over the last year. We think hat kind of performance, if repeated frequently, could well lead to difficulties for the stock. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While NVIDIA has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 81% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Summing UpWe could understand if investors are concerned about NVIDIA's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$2.19b. The cherry on top was that in converted 81% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$4.8b. So we are not troubled with NVIDIA's debt use. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - NVIDIA has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

""But it's not set in stone because AI chips can carry out different functions and there aren't set boundaries or metrics.""Rebellions' ATOM is designed to excel at running computer vision and chatbot AI applications. Because it targets specific tasks rather than doing a wide range, the chip consumes only about 20% of the power of an Nvidia A100 chip on those tasks, said Rebellions co-founder and chief executive Park Sunghyun.A100 is the most popular chip for AI workloads, powerful enough to create - in industry lingo, ""train"" - the AI models. ATOM, designed by Rebellions and manufactured by Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co, does not do training.Story continuesWhile countries such as Taiwan, China, France, Germany and the United States have extensive plans to support their semiconductor companies, the South Korean government is rare in singling out AI chips for a concentrated push.Seoul will put out a notice this month for two data centres, called neural processing unit farms, with only domestic chipmakers allowed to bid, an official at the Ministry of Science and ICT told Reuters.'TWISTING ARMS'In a country whose firms supply half the world's memory chips, the authorities want to create a market that can be a test bed for AI chipmakers, aiming to foster global competitors.""The government is twisting the arm of the data centres and telling them, 'Hey, use these chips',"" Rebellions' Park, a former Morgan Stanley engineer, told Reuters.Without such support, he said, data centres and their customers would likely stick with Nvidia chips.Sapeon Korea Inc also plans to participate in the project, the SK Telecom Co subsidiary said.FuriosaAI, backed by South Korea's top search engine Naver Corp and state-run Korea Development Bank, told Reuters it will also bid.""There's a lot of momentum behind Nvidia's developments. These startups have got to build momentum, so that will take time,"" said Alan Priestley, an analyst at IT research firm Gartner. ""But government incentives such as what's happening in Korea could well affect the market share within Korea.""Rebellions will seek to participate in the government project in a consortium with KT Corp, a big Korean telecom, cloud and data centre operator, in the hopes of weaning Nvidia customers off the U.S. supplier.""Amid high dependence on foreign GPUs (graphics processing units) globally, the cooperation between KT and Rebellions will allow us to have an 'AI full stack' that encompasses software and hardware based on domestic technology,” said KT vice president Bae Han-chul.Rebellions declined to give a forecast for its AI chip venture. It has raised 122 billion won ($96 million), including 30 billion won from KT in a funding round joined by Singapore's Temasek Pavilion Capital and 10 billion won grant from the South Korean government.(Reporting By Jane Lanhee Lee in Oakland, Calif., and Joyce Lee in Seoul; Editing by Miyoung Kim and William Mallard)]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to Analysts.Green hydrogen and fuel cells are gaining traction as the world looks for alternative sources to fossil fuels in its battle against climate change. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and is a powerful fuel source. It is an efficient and clean source of energy, producing near-zero emissions when burned. Fuel cells are devices that convert chemical energy from hydrogen into electrical energy. They are highly efficient and have no moving parts, making them a reliable source of power. With continued research and development, green hydrogen and fuel cells could become an important part of the global energy mix.Analyses of the Global Green Hydrogen and Fuel Cell IndustriesAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global green hydrogen industry was valued at $676 million in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 61% from 2022 through 2027, reaching a value of $7.3 billion at the end of the forecasted period. The market's expansion is expected to be primarily driven by a significant decrease in the cost of generating renewable energy from solar and wind sources, technological advancements in electrolysis technologies, and favorable demand trends from fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as well as the power generation industry. Some of the limiting factors the green hydrogen industry is faced with include hefty infrastructure costs for green hydrogen production and an underdeveloped market.The report further pointed out that, segment wise, in 2022 the mobility segment accounted for the major market share of the green hydrogen industry and represented 58% of its value. The mobility segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63.4% and account for $4.55 billion of the green hydrogen market by 2027. The power generation segment accounted for $88.5 million of the market's value in 2022, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63% from 2022 to 2027, reaching a value of $1.01 billion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesAnother report by MarketsandMarkets estimated that the global fuel cell industry was valued at $2.9 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to $9.1 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 26.0%. The primary factors propelling this growth include a surge in demand for clean and emissions-free power generation and strict regulations for carbon emissions across the globe. A major limiting factor for the global fuel cell market is the high costs of rare-earth metals that are used as catalysts in fuel cells. This makes fuel cell technology more expensive, when compared to battery technology, and can impact FCEV sales.The hydrogen and fuel cell market is a rapidly growing sector of the energy industry. With the need for clean and renewable energy sources, government incentives, and the increasing number of applications for hydrogen and fuel cells, the market is expected to continue to experience strong growth in the years to come. The key players in the hydrogen and fuel cell market include Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE), and Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), among others. These companies are investing heavily in research and development in order to further advance the hydrogen fuel cell technology and increase the efficiency of their products.10 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Tommy Krombacher on UnsplashOur MethodologyAfter getting a general idea of the major players from industry analysis reports, we screened for stocks of companies that are operating in the green hydrogen and fuel cell industries.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Walt Disney, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.038 = US$6.7b ÷ (US$202b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Walt Disney has an ROCE of 3.8%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Entertainment industry average of 8.4%. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Walt Disney compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Walt Disney.What Does the ROCE Trend For Walt Disney Tell Us?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Walt Disney, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 18% over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.The Bottom LineWhile returns have fallen for Walt Disney in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. These trends are starting to be recognized by investors since the stock has delivered a 4.3% gain to shareholders who've held over the last five years. Therefore we'd recommend looking further into this stock to confirm if it has the makings of a good investment.Story continuesWalt Disney could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation  on our platform quite valuable.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

140,8b7a80f2-960b-3e57-a697-8d64fe0573a7,DIS,2023-02-13,10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-companies-industries-money-during-165619500.html,1676220979,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TMUS', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'SNPS', 'HD', 'PG']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 companies and industries that make money during a recession. To skip our detailed analysis of inflation-resistant companies and sectors, you can go directly to see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.The worst economic recession recession recorded in recent history was the 2008 global financial crisis. The crisis began within the US housing market, with home prices rising rapidly in the late 1990s and exceeding income growth by 2000. This created a housing bubble consisting of record-breaking prices for housing in the US, which eventually burst and led to a market collapse for subprime mortgages. In the aftermath, the whole world was forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, with the after-effects of the crisis leaking into the global economy. By analysing the market in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, and later with additional market research post-COVID-19, financial researchers and analysts have managed to pinpoint several industries that fare well during an economic downturn.As a result, companies operating within these industries like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are often considered to be money-makers in times of recession. According to McKinsey report published in 2009, recession-resistant industries include consumer staples, healthcare, telecommunication services, and utilities, among more. In 2008, the total returns to shareholders fell for all sectors by over 20%, but consumer staples was an exception to this.A look at the utilities industry, another traditional recession-proof sector, clarified that companies operating in this area were also able to perform much better than others. KPMG's report on European power and utilities, published in 2021, showed that the deal value of the European power and utilities sector rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021. This came about as a result of higher power prices in the aftermath of the COVID-19 economic downturn. Another example of a fairly recession-resistant industry is the healthcare sector. Research shared by Cushman &amp; Wakefield shows that between 1967 and 2019, American spending on healthcare has been on the rise, even during the recessionary years of 2007-2009. Healthcare spending has been roughly doubling every 13 years, with it accounting for about 18% of the US GDP in 2019, up from 13% in 2000. Consumer spending also steadily rose in the healthcare industry for over 60 years. Between 1959 and 2019, the average annual growth rate was calculated at 3.7%. This stands in stark contrast to the general belief that consumer spending always drops during recessions, and goes to show that some industries can conversely benefit in times of recession, as they offer products and services that cannot be cut out of everyday life for most people.Story continues10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.Let's now take a look at 10 companies and industries that make money during a recession.Our MethodologyWe have combined data from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis and Bloomberg to pick 10 companies that have proven to perform well during the global recession in 2008. To measure their resistance to recessions, we have considered their stock performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 during 2008, using Yahoo Finance's historical stock price data where needed. We also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the company's stocks. They are ranked based on their outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008, from the lowest to the highest percentage.Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 8.8%The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a world-renowned entertainment company. It operates through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments. The company is based in Burbank, California.On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall reiterated an Overweight rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares, alongside a $125 price target.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has diversified its business to include not only media entertainment but also recreational theme parks and experiences. One result of such diversification has been the company's resilience in times of economic turmoil. During the 2008 financial crisis, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 8.8%. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while Disney's theme parks and cruise business were shut down, Disney+ streaming subscriptions surged to include 73.7 million subscribers by November 2020, relative to the company's goal to reach between 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024. Such growth allowed the company to outperform the S&amp;P 500 by 9% in 2020 as well.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a recession-resistant company investors should look at today.9. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)Industry: Information TechnologyS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 9.9%Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is an application software company providing electronic design automation software products used in the design and testing of integrated circuits. The company is based in Mountain View, California.Peter Sazel at Atlantic Equities re-initiated coverage of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) shares on January 17 with an Overweight rating and a $390 price target.Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a leading technology company that offers a platform for the testing of semiconductor chips and software applications. Analysts consider the semiconductor industry to be a secular growth market, meaning the demand for chip testing and designing services is likely to remain constant even during recessions. This belief is supported by the performance of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) during the 2008 recession when the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 9.9%. Even during the market downturn in 2020, the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 70%.TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, mentioned Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“New to the strategy this quarter was Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), a provider of electronic design automation software products used to design and test integrated circuits. The electronic design automation market is a essentially a duopoly with one other major player in the space. As such, the barriers to entry are very high and will likely remain that way due to rising chip complexity.”8. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS)Industry: Communication ServicesS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 14.8%T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is a wireless telecommunication services company providing mobile communications services in the US, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company is based in Bellevue, Washington.An Overweight rating was reiterated on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) shares on January 5 by analyst Philip Cusick at JPMorgan. The analyst also placed a $200 price target on the stock.T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) has become the second-largest US wireless provider after its merger with Sprint. The company managed to beat the odds during the global 2008 recession by outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by 14.8%. It also outperformed the benchmark index by 55.7% in 2020. Since T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is now an even more significant player in the communication services industry, it may prove to be recession-resistant in the coming years as well, due to its ability to outgrow its primary competitors.7. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 21.37%Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another entertainment and streaming company on our list. It offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and more on its platform. The company has recently also added mobile games across different genres and languages to its arsenal of products.Joseph Bonner at Argus holds a Buy rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares as of January 23. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $340 to $390.Between October 9, 2007, and March 9, 2009, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) brought in a total return of 68.9%, according to Bloomberg. The company is also a lower-cost entertainment option compared to peers like The Walt Disney Company, ensuring that during recessions, consumers on the lookout for cheaper entertainment options would gravitate toward it. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 21.37% in 2008, and its subscriber growth increased by 26% to 9.3 million during the same year. This shows that the company was able to actually perform better during an economic downturn.Polen Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has nearly doubled since its May 2022 lows and was our top performer for both the quarter and the year. In the summer, we added to our position meaningfully after our research indicated that the company’s two new monetization levers (requiring fees for shared passwords and the introduction of an advertising-supported subscription) would be very additive to the company’s revenue and profits beginning in early 2023. The company has since announced plans to disallow password sharing, which should provide a boost to revenue and profit growth nearly immediately as account holders or those that are borrowing passwords are required to pay to continue to watch Netflix content. The ad-supported subscription tier should also be a clear positive, not only for the company’s financials but also for consumers and marketers alike. While the subscription fee for the ad-supported tier is only about $7/month in the U.S., the ad revenue per subscriber that Netflix earns for consumers choosing this option could easily add another $15 per month or more in the U.S., potentially making Netflix’s ad-supported subscription tier the company’s most revenue generative and profitable. Even if more premium subscribers than expected downgrade to the adsupported option, we think there should be significant revenue uplift for Netflix. It appears market participants have been doing this math as well, driving the stock price higher over the last seven months.”6. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Industry: Home Improvement RetailS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 23.9%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a consumer discretionary company operating Home Depot stores across the US. The company sells home improvement products, maintenance, repair, and operations products, and much more. It is based in Atlanta, Georgia.On December 13, Max Rakhlenko at Cowen reiterated an Outperform rating on The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $350 to $379.Typically, sales for a company like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) would fall during a recession because of decreased consumer spending. However, the company is well-versed in allocating capital in a way that grows its value. Over the past 10 years, the company's profit margin increased from 6% to 11%. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 23.9% in 2008. Additionally, in 2020 it was seen that interest rate cuts and a lack of entertainment activities in 2020 actually led to a boom in the housing and home improvement markets. So in 2020, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) outperformed the benchmark index by 5.3% as well.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a company that has managed to beat the odds during recessions in the past, making it a safe option for investors as well.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession. Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for RecessionJim Cramer's Recession-Proof Stocks14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A RecessionDisclosure: None. 10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

While the benchmark First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:CIBR) may have gained roughly 9% in the new year, it declined half-a-percent in the trailing five sessions. Also, in the trailing year, it’s down about 13%.Nevertheless, the red ink presents an intriguing case for cybersecurity stocks to buy. Fundamentally, demand for the underlying sector will only rise higher. According to data from SonicWall, in 2021, ransomware attacks increased by 105% from the previous year. As well, encrypted threats jumped by 167%. More than likely, we’ll see similar figures for 2022, if not higher.Plus, the business model of cybersecurity makes perfect sense. For instance, the average cost of malware-related attacks pings at $1.4 million. However, for major enterprises, the figure can soar considerably. Therefore, protection begins to pay off rather quickly, boding well for the below cybersecurity stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFTNTFortinet$58.25AKAMAkamai$85.74ZSZscaler$140.36SSentinelOne$16.04PANWPalo Alto$166.58GENGen Digital$21.40CRWDCrowdStrike$114.62Fortinet (FTNT)An image of the word cybersecurity overlaid over a pixelated background, images of locks and shields and virus icons surrounding itSource: BeeBright / ShutterstockOne of the top names among cybersecurity stocks to buy, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) develops and sells cybersecurity solutions, such as physical firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems and endpoint security components. So far this year, FTNT skyrocketed to the tune of 23%. However, shares still represent a relative discount. During the trailing year, FTNT dipped about 10% of equity value.Financially, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.06, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 24.5%, outpacing nearly 81% of its peers. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period is 28.9%, beating out over 69% of rivals.Story continuesTurning to Wall Street, analysts peg FTNT as a consensus moderate buy. Most recently, Morgan Stanley reiterated its “buy” rating, forecasting a $70 price target. On average, experts believe FTNT will climb to $67.29. If so, this would imply upside potential of 12.83%.Akamai (AKAM)A close-up shot of fingers over a keyboard with blue and white text overlaid.Source: ShutterstockA content delivery network, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) provides web and internet security services. Specifically, Akamai implements distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation and other security services in its edge server platform, making it one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy. Still, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way (yet). In the trailing year, AKAM lost over 25% of equity value.Still, investors ignore AKAM at the potential risk of incurring an opportunity cost. Per Gurufocus.com, the market prices AKAM at a forward multiple of 14.42. As a discount to earnings, Akamai ranks better than 76.81% of the competition. Also, AKAM trades hands at 15.83-times FCF. In contrast, the sector median stands at 23.61 times.Currently, covering analysts peg AKAM as a consensus moderate buy. Among the most bullish analysts is Cowen, which features a “buy” rating on Akamai. As well, it anticipates a price target of $137. On average, the price forecast is $99.38, implying over 15% upside potential.Zscaler (ZS)internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecuritySource: Song_about_summer / ShutterstockA cloud security firm, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is one of the best-performing cybersecurity stocks to buy this year. Specializing in cloud migration services, Zscaler managed to gain nearly 25% of equity value in 2023 thus far. However, the company has a long ways to climb. In the trailing year, ZS lost a staggering 51%.Still, this might encourage contrarian speculators to bid up ZS on the implied discount. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), ZS rates as a significantly undervalued investment. Objectively, the company performs well in the top-line operational segment. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 46.7%, beating out nearly 93% of its sector rivals. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period pings at 93.7%.Presently, Wall Street analysts assess Zscaler as a consensus moderate buy. Recently, BMO Capital reiterated its “buy” rating with a $145 price target. On average, experts believe ZS will rise to $166.96. If so, this target implies upside potential of over 21%. Thus, it’s worth consideration for cybersecurity stocks to buy for gamblers.SentinelOne (S)A man sitting in front of a computerSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Mountain View, California, SentinelOne (NYSE:S) uses machine learning for monitoring personal computers, Internet of Things devices, and cloud workloads. From a fundamental view, SentinelOne ranks among the top cybersecurity stocks to buy. However, the market doesn’t quite believe that. While S stock gained 8% this year, in the trailing 365 days, it hemorrhaged more than 66%.Again, it’s an ugly loss but it could attract market speculators. Financially, the company could use some work – no one should be under any illusions. For instance, shares trade hands at 12-times sales. In the context of a value proposition to revenue, SentinelOne ranks worse than nearly 89% of its peers. However, the company enjoys a solid balance sheet. In particular, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 25.31 times, above almost 73% of the industry.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg S stock as a consensus moderate buy. Most recently, JPMorgan Chase weighed in, initiating a “buy” rating with a price target of $18. On average, the consensus price target stands at $19.63, implying nearly 25% upside potential. If so, S ranks among the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)A person holding a tablet with a key lock hologram floating above it. Represents cybersecurity stocks.Source: ShutterstockOne of the most-referenced cybersecurity stocks to buy, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) specializes in advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings that extend those firewalls to cover other aspects of security. To be sure, it’s a leading performer this year, gaining 20% of equity value. However, in the trailing year, shares dipped around 7%.Still, that might get speculators that were sitting on the sidelines to reconsider PANW stock. In fairness, Palo Alto doesn’t enjoy the most compelling financials. For instance, Gurufocus.com rates PANW as fairly valued. As well, the underlying enterprise could use some shoring up of its balance sheet.That aside, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 22.1%. This beats out 78% of the competition. Also, it enjoys a solid gross margin of 69%, ranking better than nearly 76% of peers.Turning to Wall Street, analyst peg PANW as a consensus strong buy. Most recently, BMO Capital reiterated its “buy” rating with a $220 price target. On average, the forecast calls for a price of $210.46. This would imply upside potential of nearly 27%.Gen Digital (GEN)A digital illustration of a hacker in a blue sweatshirt.Source: ShutterstockA multinational software firm, Gen Digital (NASDAQ:GEN) provides cybersecurity software and services. With the dramatic rise in cyberattacks, GEN should be one of the top players among cybersecurity stocks to buy. However, it’s down almost a percent so far this year. And in the past 365 days, GEN dropped more than 30% of equity value.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, GEN rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Objectively, the market prices GEN at a forward multiple of 10.08. As a discount to earnings, Gen Digital ranks better than 91.77% of the industry. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin stands at 17.83%, above over 89% of its peers.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg GEN as a consensus moderate buy. Most recently, RBC Capital reiterated its “hold” position on Gen Digital. However, its price target stands at $26, representing 21% upside potential. Overall, the consensus price target is $27.50, implying upside potential of 28%.CrowdStrike (CRWD)a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockAnother popular name among cybersecurity stocks to buy, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence and cyberattack response services. Because of exceptional relevancies, CRWD managed to gain nearly 11% of equity value. However, in the trailing year, shares eroded almost 39%.Per Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, CrowdStrike represents a significantly undervalued investment. From an objective view, that might be questionable. Nevertheless, the company enjoys certain fiscal attributes. In particular, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 63.6%, outpacing 95% of its rivals. Also, while net margin is negative, its gross margin hits 73.55%, above over 80% of the competition.Notably, among 36 covering analysts, CrowdStrike commands a strong buy consensus rating. Only four experts peg CRWD as a hold. Significantly, no one considers CrowdStrike a sell. Looking forward, the consensus price target pings at $160.85, implying upside potential of 40.5%. Therefore, CRWD deserves careful consideration for cybersecurity stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like United Rentals (NYSE:URI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for United Rentals How Fast Is United Rentals Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, United Rentals has grown EPS by 26% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$135m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesShould You Add United Rentals To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into United Rentals' strong EPS growth.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks.Despite a population of just 3.7 million people, if all U.S. states were countries, Connecticut would be the 67th largest country in the world, bigger than Finland, Czech Republic, Portugal and New Zealand, with a 2021 GDP of nearly $300 billion.Connecticut has been a manufacturing state since the colonization era, with its factories providing stiff competition to those in England. Through the decades, the state has given the world many new inventions including steamboats, lollipops, corkscrews and vulcanized rubber among others. This is why you will also see manufacturing companies among the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. Meanwhile, insurance companies are also a huge contributor to the state's economy with Connecticut being known as an insurance state for close to 200 years now. Agriculture may not have the same influence it did in previous centuries, but it is also still an important contributor to the economy of the state.25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocksSean Pavone/Shutterstock.comEven though Connecticut had the highest per capita personal income of any state in 2013, it also had the second-largest disparity in income between the top 1% and the bottom 99%, which showed a high level of inequality and standard of living for people in the state. Currently, Connecticut's unemployment rate is 4.2%, with only 11 states recording worse unemployment rates. This is still a significant improvement from November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.2% while the pre-pandemic unemployment rate was 3.4% in February 2020. Even though the unemployment rate is relatively high, the state has seen ten consecutive months of job growths but still trails the national average.Like most states in the U.S., Connecticut provides significant support to businesses in the state to encourage more companies to incorporate or initiate in the state and possibly even join the 25 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks. These incentives include providing grant-in-arrears equal to the value of 25% of withholding taxes from net new employees for eligible companies which have at least 25 employees. Specific eligible employers can receive a grant of up to 50% and these grants are available for up to 9 years. The state also operates tax credit programs which provide nonrefundable corporate income tax credits to eligible companies who invest at least $5 million in facilities in eligible areas. Meanwhile, several tax exemptions can also be availed based on specific situations including sales and use tax exemption, real and personal property tax exemption, and data center tax exemptions. In addition, businesses located in an enterprise zone could be eligible for ""an abatement on real and business personal property taxes of up to 80% for 5 years and a 10-year, 25% tax credit on the portion of the Connecticut corporation business tax that is directly attributable to the company relocation, expansion or renovation project. The credit may increase to 50% based on the number of new jobs created.""Story continuesThe 20 biggest Connecticut companies and stocks have combined revenues of around $420 billion and a market cap of around $550 billion. To determine these companies, we first extracted the biggest Connecticut companies by revenue from Fortune 500 and confirmed their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance.

A recent report on the semiconductor chip industry helps to show the pattern – and sheds some light on where and how investors can position themselves now for maximum advantage.To begin with, the report, based on global chip sales data, places the start of the current cycle in early 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic crisis. While a hard blow to economies generally, this period also saw the start of a boom in chip sales; demand increased as office workers moved to remote connections, and as consumers upgraded home computer systems to meet the burden of increased work-from-home, online school, and e-commerce shopping. A surge in smartphone and tablet purchases also helped fuel demand for chips. That momentum held through the first half of 2022.We’re in the bust phase now, and have been for at least half a year. Sales numbers reached record high levels in the first half of last year, but tumbled in the second half. The question now is, have we hit bottom, or are nearing the bottom, in this cycle?5-star analyst Vijay Rakesh, of Mizuho Securities, says that we are approaching a bottom, and he predicts a turn for the better in the near future.“We see improving structural trends driving an accelerated path to supply/demand balance for Memory,"" Rakesh noted. ""Near-term headwinds remain with high inventories and 1Q23E PCs/ Handsets/Servers expected down 20%/20%/10% q/q, and Memory pricing down 10% YTD; however, we are close to a cyclical bottom. 1Q23 could see the peak in inventories and a trough in revenue, with fundamentals set to recover in 2H23E/2024E.”To prepare for that coming upturn, Rakesh has upgraded three chip stocks from Neutral to Buy. Using TipRanks’ database, we wanted to see if other Wall Street analysts agree with Rakesh's calls. Here’s what we found out.Story continuesMicron Technology, Inc. (MU)The first chip giant on our radar is Micron Technology, a $65 billion player in the memory chip segment. Micron is well known for its data storage products, including DRAM, flash storage, and USB drive semiconductor chip lines. The company’s 1-beta DRAM chip is most advanced currently on the market, and the firm has recently announced upgrades to its data server memory portfolio line-up.While Micron has been active in keeping its chip lines at the forefront technology, the company has seen its sales decline in recent months. In the most recent reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal year 2023 – the quarter ending on December 1, 2022 – Micron showed a top line of $4.09 billion. This was down sharply from the $6.64 billion reported in 4Q22, and down from the $7.69 billion reported in 1Q22. The company’s earnings, which had been running positive despite the sales decline, turned to a negative 4-cents per share in 1Q23.Unsurprisingly, the company’s share price has also been declining over the past year. Over the last 12 months, MU stock has fallen 33%, more than double the 15% drop in the NASDAQ over the same period.Checking in with Mizuho’s Rakesh, however, we find that the analyst is upbeat for the long term. As noted, he has upgraded his stance on MU from Neutral to Buy, and backing that, Rakesh writes: “While we could continue to see some near-term weakness with inventory digestion at PC/smartphone/data center, we believe capex cuts, supply a multi-year low, and 2H rebound along with improving investor sentiment position MU well as we see a FebQ/MayQ trough.”Along with the Buy rating, Rakesh also gives MU stock a $72 price target, implying ~20% upside for the coming year. (To watch Rakesh’s track record, click here)Leading tech firms like Micron will always pick up attention from Wall Street, and this company has 23 recent analyst reviews on record. These include 16 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See Micron stock forecast)Western Digital (WDC)Next up is Western Digital, a major player in the chip industry. Western, based in San Jose, California, is another specialist in computer memory – but its focus is on hard disk drives and other primary data storage, as well as SSDs and flash drives. Western has built a solid position in the data center and cloud storage niches, and its product lines feature well-known brand names including WD and SanDisk.Western Digital shows the same pattern in revenue and earnings that we saw above in Micron: a top line decline starting in the latter half of calendar year 2022, accompanied by a dropoff at the bottom line turning to negative earnings. The most recent reported quarter, Q2 of fiscal year 2023 (the quarter corresponding to calendar 4Q22), Western reported $3.11 billion in total revenue. While this was at the high end of the previously published guidance, it was still down almost 17% from the previous quarter, and was down 35% year-over-year.On the bottom line, Western reported a fiscal Q2 earnings loss of 42 cents per share, by non-GAAP measures. In GAAP terms, the quarterly EPS loss was $1.40. These figures were down from profits in the previous quarter, of 8 cents by GAAP measures and 20 cents by non-GAAP.Despite the losses in earnings/revenue, Western Digital still holds a strong position in its niche – and is aiming to improve its standing. The company has recently been sounding out talks with Japanese chip maker Kioxia on a potential merger. While this remains at the rumor stage (neither company has confirmed anything), such a move would create a combined entity with control over one-third of the market for NAND flash chips.In the eyes of Mizuho’s Rakesh, this gives support to the recently upgraded Buy rating on WDC stock. Rakesh writes: “We believe WDC is positioned for upside in HDD [hard disk drive], and undervalued given a potential 2H23/24E NAND rebound and a possible strategic NAND spin with Elliot activism and possible Kioxia merger talks... While near-term we see some challenges in 1H23E with inventory corrections and softer demand, we see an improving HDD/NAND market as suppliers focus on lowering capex and supply growth to help normalize inventories, setting up for a better 2H23E/2024E recovery.”Based on all of the above factors, Rakesh gives WDC shares a $50 price target to back his Buy rating. That figure implies ~16% upside from current levels.Overall, there have been 14 analysts sounding off lately on WDC, and their reviews include 7 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See WDC stock forecast)Seagate Technology (STX)The last chip stock we’re looking at is Seagate Technology, long a leader in hard disk drive (HDD) tech. Seagate developed the first 5.25-inch hard drives back in the 80s, and over the years has followed a successful course of growth through acquisition. Today, Seagate is a $14 billion player with a line of products in three areas: Cloud &amp; Data Center; Specialized Drives; and Personal Storage.Following the same pattern like Micron and Western Digital, Seagate has seen its top and bottom lines fall off over the past several months. It’s last quarterly report was for fiscal 2Q23 (the quarter ending this past December 30), and showed revenues of $1.89 billion. This was down 7% sequentially – and 39% year-over-year. Earnings have fallen to a just 16 cents per share by non-GAAP measures; the GAAP EPS came in at a loss of 16 cents per share. Looking forward, however, analysts are forecasting a fiscal 3Q non-GAAP EPS increase to 26 cents.Against this backdrop, Mizuho’s Rakesh got one thing to say: don't throw the towel just yet. The analyst believes this company has sound prospects for getting out of the doldrums sooner rather than later.“STX has managed significant ~25% q/q inventory reduction with 2H demand positioned better, and a margin accretive HAMR roadmap into 2024E for 30TB+ mass capacity drives... We see HDD inventories normalizing post-1Q23E with potential for a return growth earlier than as inventories are flushed out at key enterprise customers, setting STX up for a strong 2HC23E,” Rakesh opined.This is another chip stock that Rakesh has upgraded to Buy, and his price target here, $82, indicates potential for a 15% upside over the course of this year.All in, all, this stock shows an almost-even split among the Street’s analysts; of the 22 recent reviews on file, there are 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and a single Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

Follow FIS on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter (@FISGlobal).FIS Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.These non-GAAP measures include constant currency revenue, organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’ operating performance. The constant currency and organic revenue growth measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue growth also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures and excludes revenue from Corporate and Other, giving investors further insight into our performance. Finally, free cash flow provides further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.Constant currency revenue represents reported operating segment revenue excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.Organic revenue growth is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period, which is adjusted to add pre-acquisition revenue of acquired businesses for a portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was owned, and subtract pre-divestiture revenue for divested businesses for the portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was not owned, for any acquisitions or divestitures by FIS. When referring to organic revenue growth, revenues from our Corporate and Other segment, which is comprised of revenue from non-strategic businesses, are excluded.Adjusted EBITDA reflects net earnings (loss) before interest, other income (expense), taxes, equity method investment earnings (loss), and depreciation and amortization, and excludes certain costs, such as impairment expense, and other transactions that management deems non-operational in nature, or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. For 2021, it also excludes incremental and direct costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue.Adjusted net earnings excludes the impact of certain costs, such as impairment expense, and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. These include, among others, the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization and equity method investment earnings (loss), both of which are recurring.Adjusted EPS reflects adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.Free cash flow reflects net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and excluding certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows, including incremental and direct costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, less capital expenditures excluding capital expenditures related to the Company’s new headquarters. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS website, www.fisglobal.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThis earnings release and today’s webcast contain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about anticipated financial outcomes, including any earnings guidance or projections, projected revenue or expense synergies or dis-synergies, business and market conditions, outlook, foreign currency exchange rates, deleveraging plans, expected dividends and share repurchases of the Company and, following the proposed spin-off, of the Merchant Solutions business, the Company’s and the Merchant Solutions business’ sales pipeline and anticipated profitability and growth, the outcome of our previously announced comprehensive assessment, as well as other statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including statements with respect to certain assumptions and strategies of the Company and the Merchant Solutions business following the proposed spin-off, the anticipated benefits of the spin-off, and the expected timing of completion of the spin-off are forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""project,"" ""continue,"" ""likely,"" and similar expressions, and include statements reflecting future results or guidance, statements of outlook and various accruals and estimates. These statements relate to future events and our future results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge announced today is based in part on estimates of future performance, so this announcement should also be considered a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management.Actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties to which forward-looking statements are subject include the following, without limitation:changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including those resulting from COVID-19 or other pandemics, a recession, intensified international hostilities, acts of terrorism, increased rates of inflation or interest, changes in either or both the United States and international lending, capital and financial markets or currency fluctuations;the risk of losses in the event of defaults by merchants (or other parties) to which we extend credit in our card settlement operations or in respect of any chargeback liability, either of which could adversely impact liquidity and results of operations;the risk that acquired businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the integration will be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than anticipated;the risk that cost savings and synergies anticipated to be realized from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected;the risks of doing business internationally;the effect of legislative initiatives or proposals, statutory changes, governmental or applicable regulations and/or changes in industry requirements, including privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations;the risks of reduction in revenue from the elimination of existing and

The two companies expect to maintain a strong commercial relationship, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses. FIS expects the spin-off to be completed within the next 12 months.FIS’ Board and management determined as part of their previously announced and ongoing strategic review that a spin-off of Merchant Solutions, to be named Worldpay, offers the best path to enhance shareholder value, including by:Increasing strategic and operational focus to capitalize on growth and margin potentialAligning capital allocation and capital structures with long-term growth targets and underlying market needs, including potentially participating in M&amp;AEnhancing the ability to align talent with shareholder returns, including through competitive and focused equity compensation programsLeadership Commentary""In evaluating a broad range of alternatives as part of our previously announced comprehensive assessment of FIS’ strategy, businesses, operations, and structure, FIS management and the Board concluded that the spin-off of Worldpay will unlock shareholder value by improving both companies’ performance, enhancing client services, and simplifying operational management,"" said Jeffrey A. Goldstein, Chairman of the Board. ""We are confident that this is the right time for the separation of Worldpay. The pace of disruption in payments is rapidly accelerating, requiring increased investment in growth and a different capital allocation strategy for our Merchant Solutions business. This spin-off will create two industry-leading, publicly traded companies with sharper focus and increased agility, each well positioned to capitalize on the significant value creation opportunities ahead in their respective markets.""Story continuesCEO and President Stephanie Ferris said, ""I’m confident that today’s announcement advances our goal of optimizing for performance and returns while improving the satisfaction of our clients and colleagues. We will create two more focused, agile companies that can pursue tailored strategies that are aligned with specific long-term growth opportunities. Both companies will be market leaders in their own right, and we believe that, as separate companies with a commercial relationship, we will deliver a superior outcome. Specifically, the separation will enable FIS to target a strong investment grade credit rating, while allowing Worldpay to invest more aggressively for growth. We believe this approach will best position us to drive innovation and deliver the most competitive products and solutions, benefitting our employees, clients, partners and shareholders.""WorldpayUpon completion of the proposed spin-off, the Merchant Solutions business will operate as Worldpay, reestablishing and strengthening a brand that remains highly trusted among clients and partners.Worldpay, the largest global merchant acquirer1 by transactions with $2 trillion in payments volume in 2022, will remain a leading provider of integrated payment technology solutions for eCommerce, enterprise, and small and medium sized businesses (SMB). Worldpay is a leader in cross-border eCommerce, with $4.8 billion of revenue and $2.3 billion of Adjusted EBITDA in 2022. The business’ revenue was comprised of 43% enterprise, 27% SMB, and 30% eCommerce in 2022.As an independent, publicly traded company, Worldpay is well positioned to benefit from exposure to secular high-growth markets globally, extensive domain expertise and portfolio breadth, strong long-term and marquee client relationships, and global distribution and scale. In addition, with a different capital allocation strategy, Worldpay will be able to pursue more aggressive investment opportunities, including M&amp;A, in order to:Expand in eCommerce – expanding geographic coverage and payment optimizationStrengthen its Enterprise Offerings – leveraging its powerful value proposition to drive next-generation omni-channel experiences and enterprise commerceTransform SMB – shifting towards software-led payments while providing integrated software vendors (ISVs) with embedded finance capabilitiesFIS announced Charles Drucker has been appointed as a strategic advisor to aid with the spin-off process, effective immediately. The Company also announced today that, if the spin-off is completed as expected, he will serve as CEO of Worldpay. Drucker, a proven value creating CEO who previously served as CEO of Worldpay, brings decades of experience within the financial technology industry and a strong track record of shareholder value-creation.The remainder of the Worldpay Board of Directors, management team, and headquarters will be announced at a later date. Worldpay and FIS will continue to maintain a commercial relationship to deliver critical capabilities like embedded finance and loyalty through premium payback, with customary commercial agreements in place to ensure continuity for clients.FISFollowing the proposed spin-off, FIS will remain a leading provider of financial technology solutions for financial institutions, capital markets firms, clients and corporates globally. FIS’ Banking and Capital Markets businesses generated $9.5 billion of revenue and $4.2 billion of Adjusted EBITDA in 2022, excluding Corporate and Other. The Company will continue to benefit from its strong brand in the financial services sector, extensive domain expertise and portfolio breadth, strong long-term and marquee client relationships, and its global distribution and scale.As a simpler, more focused organization, FIS will be better-positioned to deliver compounding returns by leveraging its best-in-class suite of banking and capital markets technology solutions to meet individualized client needs. FIS will drive improved performance and outcomes through a multi-part strategy that includes:Enhancing focus on the distinct needs of global and local financial institutions, with a management team and investment agenda tailored to evolving client needsDriving disruption through a modernized technology stack, building out its digital and modernization platforms such as Digital One, Payment One, Unity and Modern Banking platformOptimizing investment and capital return through a transparent capital allocation strategy with a balance of organic investment, complementary M&amp;A, dividends and share repurchasesFollowing the separation, Stephanie Ferris will continue to serve as chief executive officer of FIS with FIS headquarters remaining in Jacksonville, FL.Transaction DetailsThrough this transaction, FIS shareholders will receive a pro rata distribution of shares of Worldpay stock in a transaction that is expected to be tax-free to FIS and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The actual number of shares to be distributed to FIS shareholders will be determined prior to closing, as will the specific transaction structure.FIS is committed to optimizing strong capital allocation strategies for each business that align with each business’s long-term goals. Further details related to transaction costs and the companies’ respective capital structures, governance and other elements of the transaction will be announced at a later date.Pathway to CompletionFIS is planning for the separation to be completed within the next 12 months.

A recent report on the semiconductor chip industry helps to show the pattern – and sheds some light on where and how investors can position themselves now for maximum advantage.To begin with, the report, based on global chip sales data, places the start of the current cycle in early 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic crisis. While a hard blow to economies generally, this period also saw the start of a boom in chip sales; demand increased as office workers moved to remote connections, and as consumers upgraded home computer systems to meet the burden of increased work-from-home, online school, and e-commerce shopping. A surge in smartphone and tablet purchases also helped fuel demand for chips. That momentum held through the first half of 2022.We’re in the bust phase now, and have been for at least half a year. Sales numbers reached record high levels in the first half of last year, but tumbled in the second half. The question now is, have we hit bottom, or are nearing the bottom, in this cycle?5-star analyst Vijay Rakesh, of Mizuho Securities, says that we are approaching a bottom, and he predicts a turn for the better in the near future.“We see improving structural trends driving an accelerated path to supply/demand balance for Memory,"" Rakesh noted. ""Near-term headwinds remain with high inventories and 1Q23E PCs/ Handsets/Servers expected down 20%/20%/10% q/q, and Memory pricing down 10% YTD; however, we are close to a cyclical bottom. 1Q23 could see the peak in inventories and a trough in revenue, with fundamentals set to recover in 2H23E/2024E.”To prepare for that coming upturn, Rakesh has upgraded three chip stocks from Neutral to Buy. Using TipRanks’ database, we wanted to see if other Wall Street analysts agree with Rakesh's calls. Here’s what we found out.Story continuesMicron Technology, Inc. (MU)The first chip giant on our radar is Micron Technology, a $65 billion player in the memory chip segment. Micron is well known for its data storage products, including DRAM, flash storage, and USB drive semiconductor chip lines. The company’s 1-beta DRAM chip is most advanced currently on the market, and the firm has recently announced upgrades to its data server memory portfolio line-up.While Micron has been active in keeping its chip lines at the forefront technology, the company has seen its sales decline in recent months. In the most recent reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal year 2023 – the quarter ending on December 1, 2022 – Micron showed a top line of $4.09 billion. This was down sharply from the $6.64 billion reported in 4Q22, and down from the $7.69 billion reported in 1Q22. The company’s earnings, which had been running positive despite the sales decline, turned to a negative 4-cents per share in 1Q23.Unsurprisingly, the company’s share price has also been declining over the past year. Over the last 12 months, MU stock has fallen 33%, more than double the 15% drop in the NASDAQ over the same period.Checking in with Mizuho’s Rakesh, however, we find that the analyst is upbeat for the long term. As noted, he has upgraded his stance on MU from Neutral to Buy, and backing that, Rakesh writes: “While we could continue to see some near-term weakness with inventory digestion at PC/smartphone/data center, we believe capex cuts, supply a multi-year low, and 2H rebound along with improving investor sentiment position MU well as we see a FebQ/MayQ trough.”Along with the Buy rating, Rakesh also gives MU stock a $72 price target, implying ~20% upside for the coming year. (To watch Rakesh’s track record, click here)Leading tech firms like Micron will always pick up attention from Wall Street, and this company has 23 recent analyst reviews on record. These include 16 Buys, 5 Holds, and 2 Sells, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See Micron stock forecast)Western Digital (WDC)Next up is Western Digital, a major player in the chip industry. Western, based in San Jose, California, is another specialist in computer memory – but its focus is on hard disk drives and other primary data storage, as well as SSDs and flash drives. Western has built a solid position in the data center and cloud storage niches, and its product lines feature well-known brand names including WD and SanDisk.Western Digital shows the same pattern in revenue and earnings that we saw above in Micron: a top line decline starting in the latter half of calendar year 2022, accompanied by a dropoff at the bottom line turning to negative earnings. The most recent reported quarter, Q2 of fiscal year 2023 (the quarter corresponding to calendar 4Q22), Western reported $3.11 billion in total revenue. While this was at the high end of the previously published guidance, it was still down almost 17% from the previous quarter, and was down 35% year-over-year.On the bottom line, Western reported a fiscal Q2 earnings loss of 42 cents per share, by non-GAAP measures. In GAAP terms, the quarterly EPS loss was $1.40. These figures were down from profits in the previous quarter, of 8 cents by GAAP measures and 20 cents by non-GAAP.Despite the losses in earnings/revenue, Western Digital still holds a strong position in its niche – and is aiming to improve its standing. The company has recently been sounding out talks with Japanese chip maker Kioxia on a potential merger. While this remains at the rumor stage (neither company has confirmed anything), such a move would create a combined entity with control over one-third of the market for NAND flash chips.In the eyes of Mizuho’s Rakesh, this gives support to the recently upgraded Buy rating on WDC stock. Rakesh writes: “We believe WDC is positioned for upside in HDD [hard disk drive], and undervalued given a potential 2H23/24E NAND rebound and a possible strategic NAND spin with Elliot activism and possible Kioxia merger talks... While near-term we see some challenges in 1H23E with inventory corrections and softer demand, we see an improving HDD/NAND market as suppliers focus on lowering capex and supply growth to help normalize inventories, setting up for a better 2H23E/2024E recovery.”Based on all of the above factors, Rakesh gives WDC shares a $50 price target to back his Buy rating. That figure implies ~16% upside from current levels.Overall, there have been 14 analysts sounding off lately on WDC, and their reviews include 7 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See WDC stock forecast)Seagate Technology (STX)The last chip stock we’re looking at is Seagate Technology, long a leader in hard disk drive (HDD) tech. Seagate developed the first 5.25-inch hard drives back in the 80s, and over the years has followed a successful course of growth through acquisition. Today, Seagate is a $14 billion player with a line of products in three areas: Cloud &amp; Data Center; Specialized Drives; and Personal Storage.Following the same pattern like Micron and Western Digital, Seagate has seen its top and bottom lines fall off over the past several months. It’s last quarterly report was for fiscal 2Q23 (the quarter ending this past December 30), and showed revenues of $1.89 billion. This was down 7% sequentially – and 39% year-over-year. Earnings have fallen to a just 16 cents per share by non-GAAP measures; the GAAP EPS came in at a loss of 16 cents per share. Looking forward, however, analysts are forecasting a fiscal 3Q non-GAAP EPS increase to 26 cents.Against this backdrop, Mizuho’s Rakesh got one thing to say: don't throw the towel just yet. The analyst believes this company has sound prospects for getting out of the doldrums sooner rather than later.“STX has managed significant ~25% q/q inventory reduction with 2H demand positioned better, and a margin accretive HAMR roadmap into 2024E for 30TB+ mass capacity drives... We see HDD inventories normalizing post-1Q23E with potential for a return growth earlier than as inventories are flushed out at key enterprise customers, setting STX up for a strong 2HC23E,” Rakesh opined.This is another chip stock that Rakesh has upgraded to Buy, and his price target here, $82, indicates potential for a 15% upside over the course of this year.All in, all, this stock shows an almost-even split among the Street’s analysts; of the 22 recent reviews on file, there are 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and a single Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

159,f183b9d3-9af3-3754-99f8-aaeaea1bc1a8,STX,2023-02-13,The 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-tech-stocks-buy-203716124.html,1675975036,STORY,"['NFLX', 'MSFT', 'PI', 'META', 'CRM', 'STX', 'PODD']","[Tech stocks continue to be a major player in the stock market in 2023. Driven by ongoing innovation and investment, big-name turnarounds suggest that Feb. could be the beginning of a sharp upward trend for tech stocks. In fact, here are seven of the best tech stocks to consider for the year.PIImpinj$126.80METAMeta Platforms$178.17PODDInsulet Corporation$286.67MSFTMicrosoft$264.03STXSeagate Technology$69.43CRMSalesforce$172.56NFLXNetflix$362.79Best Tech Stocks: Impinj (PI) a visual representation of the internet connections crisscrossing the sky above a citySource: ShutterstockImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a technology company specializing in providing solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its products and services include radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems and software. Impinj’s tracking chips connect items and devices to the cloud. The RFID technology that underpins its products and services are especially useful for retail, logistics, and transportation sector firms that need to track physical assets for analytical and other purposes. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOne of the primary reasons to believe that PI stock will rise this month is its sales guidance. The company recently revised its current quarter guidance upward. Impinj had given a prior guidance range for this quarter between $71.5 to $73.5 million. However, it recently raised that guidance to at least $76 million for the quarter. That positive development, in combination with the positive Fed news of lower interest rate increases, should be a  powerful catalyst for Impinj. Best Tech Stocks: Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a prime example of how quickly fortunes can change for the better. The Facebook parent company had been largely jeered for its hard pivot to the metaverse during 2022. The tech company has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) solutions. The company is focused on creating immersive experiences through its hardware and software products. These products include AR smart glasses and VR headsets. But screenshots of its metaverse have become meme fodder. Detractors have gone so far as to suggest that the rebranding would be the death of the company. Story continuesBut the stock market is a place where a ‘what have you done for lately’ mentality rules. So Meta’s recent upbeat outlook, a $40 billion share buyback plan, and a renewed focus on efficiency are benefiting its shares in a big way. Meta’s revenues were dealt a blow when Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy measures reduced data access in early 2021. In response, Meta developed AI-based tools to improve ad targeting. Revenues could soon be higher than they were prior to Apple’s privacy changes. That strongly suggests that Meta is back and the story of its pivot is still being written. Insulet (PODD) image of the word diabetes surrounded by medical equipment.Source: Minerva Studio / Shutterstock.comInvestors should also consider Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD), a medical device company that specializes in insulin pump systems for people with diabetes. The company is well known for its ‘Omnipod’ insulin delivery system that offers a discreet and user-friendly option for people with insulin-dependent diabetes.Insulet won’t report earnings again until Feb. 23 but investors should understand that the firm’s growth has been impressive thus far. Q3 earnings, released in early Nov., showed revenues of $340.8 million. That represented a 23.7% increase on a year-over-year basis. Insulet’s Omnipod product accounted for $326.1 million, or 95.7% of the firm’s total revenues in Q3. Omnipod revenues grew 25.3% YoY. Insulet’s international Omnipod sales decreased 5.5% in Q3, to $88 million. But the company also received CE Mark approval in Q3 which opens up its international market access. It should be able to rebound and increase international sales while continuing its already strong top-line results. Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is still in limbo following its earnings release on Jan. 24. Analysts are digesting its weak overall sales growth, the lowest in six years. The result is trepidation that growth has stagnated at the company. Microsoft’s guidance for $51 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which would represent 3% growth, doesn’t help to reduce pessimism. But I think there’s good reason to believe that Microsoft is on the cusp of a new paradigm in which it is able to achieve a lot more with a lot less. The reason to believe that lies in its Azure cloud platform. Microsoft is heavily leveraging AI models into its cloud which grew 22% in the quarter with $27.1 billion in revenue. The company laid off 10,000 workers as tech firms seek greater efficiency. Overhead is shrinking while Azure and its AI investments promise greater productivity overall. Lower overall headcount reduces expenses. And AI investments could turbocharge Azure’s growth. The combination could fundamentally improve MSFT stock in a major way. Seagate Technology (STX) An image of different overlaid data chartsSource: solarseven/ShutterstockInvestors should also consider Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which specializes in data storage solutions. The company is one of the largest manufacturers of hard disk drives (HDD) in the world serving individuals and businesses. Its products are used in a wide range of end applications ranging from desktop computers to data centers. Seagate Technologies has already shown significant positive momentum in 2023. Shares have increased in price from $51.88 to $72.31 as of writing. Although STX shares are currently fully priced, meaning they trade at or above their target price, they can move higher.A high-level overview of Seagate Technologies suggests that its late 2022 business restructuring is being well received by the markets. While revenues dropped to $1.887 billion in the quarter, down from $3.116 billion a year ago, share prices are surging. The company is launching a 30-plus terabyte HAMR-based product family in the June quarter and it seems market anticipation is enough to keep prices rising. Salesforce (CRM) Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a technology company specializing in customer relationship management software. Its flagship product, also called Salesforce, is one of the most widely used CRM platforms in the world, offering a range of tools and services for sales, customer service, marketing, and more.  That said, Salesforce continues to face the dual threat of increasing competition and an economic downturn. Internally, Salesforce has suffered from a mix of low growth and profitability that decreased share prices substantially in 2022. Salesforce anticipates reaching $50 billion in revenues and 25% margins by early 2026 though skeptics remain. However, CRM stock has the might of powerful institutional investors behind it. Both Elliot Management and Inclusive Capital have taken significant positions (1)in the company. Salesforce remains the big dog in the customer relationship management software sector by far and that cannot be disregarded. Its dominant position is being challenged but sector leaders have a way of rebounding due to scale. Netflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) looks like one to consider this month and beyond. On the revenue front, Netflix reported $7.85 billion, up slightly from the $7.71 billion it recorded a year earlier. But the particularly positive news was that its subscriber growth of 7.66 million new users well exceeded the 4.5 million management had earlier projected. Netflix users have largely adopted its new ad-supported pricing updates without killing subscriber growth in the process. That’s the main takeaway investors should understand about Netflix. Its crackdown on password sharing hasn’t had the effect of slowing subscribership. And Netflix’s content continues to draw critical acclaim with titles like Wednesday, Glass Onion, Troll, and Harry and Meghan remaining popular. In short, it looks like Netflix may have weathered the worst of the storm and come out pretty strong as a result. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:RHI) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of March to $0.48. This will take the annual payment to 2.3% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. Check out our latest analysis for Robert Half International Robert Half International's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, Robert Half International's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 6.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 34%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendRobert Half International Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.60 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Robert Half International has grown earnings per share at 22% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Robert Half International Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

You can skip our detailed and historical performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks to Buy for Retirement. Millions of American households are behindhand when it comes to retirement planning. According to a study conducted by Northwestern Mutual, Americans expect that they need approximately $1.25 million to retire comfortably. This figure shows a 20% growth from the $1.05 million recorded in 2021. Another data from Natixis Investment Managers shows that 58% of the high net worth individuals mentioned that they’ll have to extend their working years instead of retiring at the age of 63.Retirees around the world search for ways to increase their earnings through investments as inflation notched its highest mark in nearly 40 years. In this regard, the Social Security Administration provided relief to retirees with the announcement of increasing benefits by 8.7% this year to weather this inflationary environment, as reported by Bloomberg. Through this increase, the average retiree benefit has grown to $1,827 per month, up $146 from the last year. However, with average annual household expenses for ages 65-74 of approximately $53,000, these social security benefits are not sufficient to cover living expenses smoothly. For this purpose, retiree investors are showing a renewed interest in the stock market, loading up steadily on dividend stocks.Historical analysis of dividend stocks shows that these securities generated stable returns for shareholders over the years. According to a paper published by Jefferson Research, dividend stocks accounted for 85% of the market’s total returns from 1926 to 2010. The paper also cited Goldman Sachs’ 2013 report which mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 9.6% through this period with a 16.2% volatility. Whereas, the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.1% with a volatility of 18%.Story continuesStocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

Further in this article, we will discuss other best stocks to buy for retirement.30 Best Stocks to Buy for RetirementImage by coombesy from PixabayOur Methodology:For this article, we first used stock screeners to find dividend stocks with a 3-year average dividend growth rate above 10% and payout ratios below 70%. From the resultant list, we picked stocks that have dividend yields above 3%, as of February 9. Along with this, the hedge fund sentiment was measured using data from 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q3 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields, as of February 9.30 Best Stocks to Buy for Retirement30. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF)Dividend yield as of February 9: 3.07% 3-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 33.8% Dividend Payout Ratio: 39.2%Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is a New York-based multinational independent investment bank that provides related financial services to its consumers. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.07%, as of February 9. In the past 3 years, it has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of 33.8%, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company also has a solid payout ratio of 39.2%.In addition to popular dividend stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), investors are also positive about Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF).In Q4 2022, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) reported revenue of $1.44 billion, which fell by 18.2% from the same period last year. However, the revenue beat Street estimates by $190 million. At the end of November 2022, the company had over $9.7 billion available in cash and cash equivalents.At the end of Q3 2022, 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF), up from 29 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $495.3 million. With over 5.7 million shares, First Pacific Advisors LLC was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.GoodHaven Capital Management mentioned Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor, and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”29. Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRTS)Dividend yield as of February 9: 3.08% 3-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 37.1% Dividend Payout Ratio: 39.6%Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)24. Darden Restaurants, Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The stock market bloodbath that started in 2022 has forced investors to shun the so-called growth companies that have nothing to show in terms of cash or tangible short-term value. That’s because investors tend to flee risky assets towards safe, value plays that can offer them safety and a refuge from volatility during difficult times. Value underperformed growth from 2007 until 2020. But the era of growth dominance seems to have ended. In a report titled Value vs. Growth Investing: Value returns with a Vengeance, JPMorgan analysts said that from 2007 through 2020 value underperformed in all sectors and asset classes. This underperformance reached its peak in 2020. The report said that as the world moved online after the pandemic, innovation and growth saw a lot of traction. The report highlights that this was the time when the markets made the same mistake as they did during the “TMT bubble” by “boosting future normalized growth rates”.The JPMorgan report says that by the end of 2020, “expectations became divorced from reality” as many software and growth companies’ valuations touched unprecedented highs.The report mentioned Tesla, Facebook and other growth companies as examples of huge valuations that were not connected with reality.""Amazon and Microsoft are undoubtedly great companies, but if you had bought them at the height of the TMT bubble in December 1999, it would have taken 10 years and 15 years, respectively, to break even. Valuation – no matter how good the company is – matters, even in the long term.""JPMorgan analysts believe value has been out of fashion for so long that many investors today aren’t used to a value-led market and they are only accustomed to small market rallies that last ""only six to nine months.”Story continues“All of this indicates that we are in for a reckoning that has only just begun.”Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the Dow 30 group of companies and picked the stocks that have a PE ratio of under 20 as of February 10.

CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What Is Occidental Petroleum's Debt?As you can see below, Occidental Petroleum had US$20.1b of debt at September 2022, down from US$32.0b a year prior. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.23b, its net debt is less, at about US$18.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Occidental Petroleum's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$7.94b due within a year, and liabilities of US$35.5b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.23b as well as receivables valued at US$4.05b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$38.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$59.5b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Occidental Petroleum's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Occidental Petroleum has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.91. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 19.2 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Better yet, Occidental Petroleum grew its EBIT by 650% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Occidental Petroleum can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last two years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Our ViewHappily, Occidental Petroleum's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Zooming out, Occidental Petroleum seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

167,3f3e191d-8363-37cb-a03b-57ced63292e9,OXY,2023-02-13,12 Most Profitable Oil Stocks in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-profitable-oil-stocks-213658965.html,1676237818,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'BP', 'EQNR', 'PCCYF', 'OXY', 'COP']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable oil stocks in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Oil Stocks in the World. 2022 was a year marked by tough economic conditions that were fueled by inflation. However, oil companies had a booming business, since high prices led to record revenues which then translated into record profits for the firms. To make their investors happy, the firms went on to declare impressive dividends - a move that generated controversy as critics pointed out that the oil company investors were profiting at the expense of ordinary people who had to pay record high prices for gasoline and other fuels.What's Happening in the Oil Industry?The Russian invasion of Ukraine also caused a shift in the global thinking for fossil fuels, as it created a vacuum for more investment into the sector due to the inability of producers to rapidly respond to a supply chain shock. Subsequently, market research firms continue to have high growth estimates for the oil industry. For instance, a report from the research firm The Business Research Company outlines that the industry was worth a stunning $6.9 trillion at the start of 2022, and ended up growing to $7.3 trillion by the end of the year with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9%. This is a high growth rate for a highly mature industry, and looking at the future, the researcher believes that the sector will sit at $8.6 trillion by the end of 2027 as it will grow at a CAGR of 4.3%.Geographically, the Business Research Company outlines that Asia Pacific is the largest oil consuming region - which is unsurprising as China alone processed 13.4 million barrels per day during the first ten months of 2022, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) believes that this year Chinese oil demand will grow by 510,000 barrels per day.Speaking of 2023, the future of crude oil prices is also causing significant debate in the industry. OPEC also believes that global demand for crude oil will grow to 101.8 million barrels per day, increasing by 2.2 million barrels. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) latest oil market report, published in January, has similar market and demand estimates, as it outlines that demand will sit at 101.7 million barrels per day and grow by 1.9 mb/d. Similarly, it also asserts that China will account for nearly half of this demand growth, but worryingly (or positively if you're an oil company) shares that supply growth will slow down to 1 million bp/d due to an 870,000 barrel drop in Russian output.Story continuesOn the topic of the Ukraine invasion, IEA shares that European sanctions against Russian oil are making their mark, as Russia's oil exports fell by 200,000 barrels per day in December over November, and the country's oil revenues also dropped by a painful $3 billion monthly in December and stood at $12.6 billion with the North Sea benchmark trading at $83 per barrel after it dropped by $18 from the previous month's peak. A disruption in the oil supply chain due to Russian sanctions has also led to more oil being on the water as ships have to travel longer distances. In fact, according to the IEA, this in transit oil soared by a massive 181 million barrels as of December 2022.OutlookFor oil prices, the outlook remains mixed. While OPEC officials, speaking to Reuters, said that prices can touch $100 this year, a survey of economists and analysts expects the per barrel price to hover around $89.7. On the other hand, investment bank Goldman Sachs holds the view that Brent crude will average at $92 per barrel this year and can reach $100 per barrel by December. These estimates are fueled by strong hope for a Chinese recovery.With these details in mind, we decided to take a look at which oil companies are the most profitable. Out of these, the top three are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).12 Most Profitable Oil Stocks in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology We listed down all major oil companies in the world according to their market capitalization and revenue.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private companies with 36% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Meanwhile, institutions make up 30% of the company’s shareholders. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola Europacific Partners?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. COBEGA, S.A. is currently the largest shareholder, with 36% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 19% and 2.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 56% stake.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Coca-Cola Europacific PartnersWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own €29m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 36%, of the Coca-Cola Europacific Partners stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 19% of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola Europacific Partners better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

According to a study conducted by Northwestern Mutual, Americans expect that they need approximately $1.25 million to retire comfortably. This figure shows a 20% growth from the $1.05 million recorded in 2021. Another data from Natixis Investment Managers shows that 58% of the high net worth individuals mentioned that they’ll have to extend their working years instead of retiring at the age of 63.Retirees around the world search for ways to increase their earnings through investments as inflation notched its highest mark in nearly 40 years. In this regard, the Social Security Administration provided relief to retirees with the announcement of increasing benefits by 8.7% this year to weather this inflationary environment, as reported by Bloomberg. Through this increase, the average retiree benefit has grown to $1,827 per month, up $146 from the last year. However, with average annual household expenses for ages 65-74 of approximately $53,000, these social security benefits are not sufficient to cover living expenses smoothly. For this purpose, retiree investors are showing a renewed interest in the stock market, loading up steadily on dividend stocks.Historical analysis of dividend stocks shows that these securities generated stable returns for shareholders over the years. According to a paper published by Jefferson Research, dividend stocks accounted for 85% of the market’s total returns from 1926 to 2010. The paper also cited Goldman Sachs’ 2013 report which mentioned that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 9.6% through this period with a 16.2% volatility. Whereas, the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.1% with a volatility of 18%.Story continuesStocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

(NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor, and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”29. Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)24. Darden Restaurants, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.According to Market Watch, the global orange juice industry is currently worth over $6 billion, and by 2027, is expected to grow to $7.6 billion, at a CAGR of 3.91%, which while not bad, isn't as strong as many other food industries, and we'll discuss why this is the case later. Currently, the global orange juice industry spans most countries across the world, with the sight of a jug or glass of orange juice being a breakfast staple in most nations, especially in the West. Despite this global presence, the industry is mainly dominated by a few select companies.Orange juice has a long and storied history, which can be traced back to the 16th century when it was first consumed by Spanish explorers, but it was only in the 20th century that orange juice became more publicly available in the United States and in other countries too. Frozen concentrate, one of the main types of orange juice, is where water in orange juice is evaporated, after which juice sugars and solids become concentrated. This concentrate is then frozen which allows for a much longer shelf life, while some concentrates mix frozen juice and concentrate in order to get sweeter flavors. This is why, more or less all shelf orange juice does not come close to tasting like real, freshly-squeezed orange juice and can often taste more sour or bitter as compared to freshly squeezed orange juice. Since most people have only ever tasted store-bought juice, they don't realize the difference in taste. When orange juice is deoxygenated, the taste is negatively impacted, which is why chemicals are added, which are technically made of oranges. This is why juices can claim to be 100% real orange as technically it's true.12 countries that produce the most orange juice in the worldDespite the global appeal of orange juice, only a few countries produce most of the world's orange juice. In fact, just three countries produce the vast majority of orange juice in the world, accounting for over 60% of the total orange juice production. In the United States, which is among the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world, Florida is the biggest producer of orange juice by far. Oranges are generally picked and processed within 24 hours so that freshness and quality is maintained, before being boxed and sold. However, Florida has seen its orange production fall 90% from all-time highs in the 1990s.Story continuesCurrently, the orange juice industry is facing several changes, which need to be worked on to ensure further growth. Rising concern for healthy items have resulted in many people switching from orange juice, which has sugar either added or present naturally in oranges, to energy drinks and sports drinks, which are a multibillion dollar industry which is also growing quite fast. Prices for oranges are continuing to rise as well, as the impact of climate change can be felt on the industry with erratic and severe weather patterns including hurricanes and droughts, which have led to a fall in the production of oranges. According to the US Department of Agriculture, orange juice production globally in 2022/2023 is expected to fall by 7% as the biggest producers in Mexico, the European Union, Brazil and the U.S. have seen a decrease in fruit available for processing. The forecast for the next year is of 1.6 million tonnes.Frozen concentrated orange juice futures hit record highs of $2.67 a pound according to New York's Intercontinental Exchange. Storms, crop greening, realty land grab and frost have all resulted in production falling significantly; two back-to-back hurricanes alone have devastated crop yield for oranges and citrus greening, a hard to fight plant disease, has contributed its fair share in impacting oranges growth. While this is great news for frozen-concentrate orange juice speculators, the price is a huge damper for the orange juice industry, as its supply is elastic. At the same time, sentiment is also suggesting that this is just the beginning and prices could increase much more in 2023. According to the director of agricultural research at AgriSompo North America “It can lead to a lot of volatility and we could see some downdraft. But this being orange juice, it’s not the most liquid commodity. Seeing it trade north of $3 a lb would not in any way surprise me.” Within this year alone, frozen-concentrate orange juice futures have increased by 30%.While there are several small-scale producers and processors in the orange juice industry, they often do not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to compete with the bigger players who dominate market share in this industry. While these challenges are difficult to surmount, the industry's response to these issues will determine its future. Currently, the biggest players in the orange juice industry include PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE:KDP). PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) owns several major juice brands including Tropicana and Naked Juice, though it sold 61% of its juice brand portfolio to PAI Partners in 2021, retaining 39%. Meanwhile, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which is the biggest producer of juices in the world, owns the Minute Maid brand, one of the most popular brands of orange juice in the world and the first company to market frozen orange juice concentrate. Nestle is another major player in this industry, marketing orange juices under the Nestle brand.To determine the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world, we scoured statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has data on everything related to orange juice, including production by country. We then ranked each country based on its production in 2020 and 2021, assigning 70% weightage to 2021 as it was the most recent year, and 30% weightage to 2020. So, let's now take a look at the countries which ensure that orange juice supply is maintained globally.12. GreeceTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 887Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 750Greek oranges are well-known for their flavor and in 2019, Greece exported orange juice worth $19 million.11. ItalyTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 1,773Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 1,500Italy's 2021 orange season saw prices remain low thanks to large harvested volumes and high yields, which were able to offset the impact of the Tristeza virus in Sicilian orange groves.10. SpainTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 3,496Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 3,511The largest producer of orange juice in Europe, Spain has registered a slight increase in production versus 2020, while prices have increased significantly in 2022. The reduction in volumes is partly because of inclement weather in the country.9. IsraelTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 2,800Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 4,300Israel has seen the highest growth in orange juice production among all the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world. Israel exports around a third of all citrus foods produced in the country.8. MoroccoTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 5,000Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 5,500Morocco has seen a 10% increase in orange juice production from 2020 to 2021.7. TurkeyTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 9,500Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 10,000According to Market Research, the orange juice industry in Turkey is worth around $20.5 million. In 2022, Turkey's fruit juice exports were expected to grow by 100%, cementing its place as among the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.6. AustraliaTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 17,400Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 16,500The overall juice industry in Australia is worth $800 million and provides around 5,000 jobs. According to ABC Australia in 2020, citrus growers in the country said that the availability of orange juice in the nation would decrease because of low prices being paid to growers as the land dedicated to growing the main juicing varieties of oranges have already decreased by 30% in the last twenty years. Since citrus growers can make more money selling fresh fruit rather than for juice. Meanwhile, drinks such as kombucha and energy drinks have also increased competition against the orange juice industry.Click to continue reading the 5 countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.Suggested articles:17 Most Valuable E-commerce Companies in the World21 Largest Italian Companies by Market CapTop 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023Disclosure: None. 12 countries that produce the most orange juice in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:MHK) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 10, 2023Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Brunk. Please go ahead.James Brunk: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' Quarterly Investor Call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's fourth quarter and full year performance and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website. I'll now turn over the call to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?Jeff Lorberbaum: Thank you, Jim. For the full year of 2022, Mohawk's net sales were $11.7 billion, up approximately 4.8% as reported or 8.8% on a constant basis. And our adjusted EPS for the year was $12.85. The flooring industry entered 2022 with momentum from strong housing markets supported by record home sales, low interest rates and rising household formations. High home equity levels, shifts to larger homes and the desire to customize living spaces during the pandemic were driving remodeling investments. As the year progressed, the U.S. housing market declined under pressure from rising interest rates and inflation. In Europe, energy and overall inflation escalated and consumers reduced discretionary spending to pay for essentials.Story continuesIn the first half of the year, the company implemented pricing actions and production that offset the inflation we incurred. With reduced home sales and remodeling in the second half of the year, our Flooring volumes decreased. Our pricing did not cover material and energy inflation. Throughout the year, commercial and new construction and remodeling activity outperformed residential. Even with the housing industry slowing during the second half of the year, we concluded 2022 with a strong balance sheet, low net debt leverage of 1.3 times EBITDA and available liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion to manage the current environment and optimize our long-term results. We acquired five bolt-on businesses during the year that extend the scope of our product offering and our distribution.These include sheet vinyl, mezzanine flooring and wood veneer plant in Europe, a nonwoven flooring manufacturer and a flooring accessories company in the U.S. When we complete the integration of these acquisitions, we will expand their sales opportunities, enhance their operations and improve their efficiencies. We've just acquired Elizabeth in Brazil and are awaiting regulatory approval to close Vitromex in Mexico, Both of which will almost double our local market positions in ceramic, expand our customer base and product offering and improve our manufacturing capabilities. The teams are preparing to integrate the businesses, which will create significant sales and operational synergies. Turning to the fourth quarter results. Mohawk net sales were $2.7 billion, down 4% as reported or approximately 1.3% on a constant basis, and our adjusted EPS was $1.32.Our revenues were driven by price increases and strength in commercial channel. Our sales across all our businesses were slower than we expected in the quarter as Residential sales contracted with rising interest rates, declining home sales and lower consumer confidence. As a consequence, our customers lowered their inventory levels and consumers reduced their spending for renovation. Unlike other products, Flooring does not require immediate replacement. So purchases can be deferred more than other durable goods. Commercial sales continued stronger than residential in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing remodeling and new construction projects. In the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment outperformed the others due to a higher level of commercial and new construction sales.Our Flooring Rest of the World segment softened as higher inflation and energy costs reduced demand in Europe. Our Flooring North America segment sales declined with lower residential activity and a reduction in customer inventory levels. The combination of weakening sales, plant shutdowns and the consumption of higher cost inventory decreased the segment's performance for the quarter. In response, we reduced production rates and lowered our inventory, which increased unabsorbed overhead expenses. We curtailed spending across the enterprise, though inflation offset many of our initiatives. In both Flooring North America as well as Flooring Rest of the World, we're taking restructuring actions in specific areas to align our operations with the present market conditions.During the quarter, energy and material costs around the world began to decline which should positively affect our future results. While we're managing the present economic cycle, we're operating with a long-term perspective and expanding capacities in areas where we have the greatest growth potential when markets rebound. These include LVT, laminate, quartz countertops, porcelain slabs and insulation. We have reduced our planned capital spending until we see greater certainty in our markets around the world. We recently announced an agreement to resolve the securities class action lawsuit filed in January 2020. Though we believe the case is without merit, further litigation would be burdensome and expensive. We reached a settlement of $60 million, a significant portion of which will be covered by insurance and is subject to court approval.We also settled a dispute with the Belgian Tax Authority regarding royalty income. Though we believe our position is correct, we settled the $187 million assessment for EUR3 million. I'll turn the call over to Jim for a review of our fourth quarter financial performance.James Brunk: Thank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just under $2.7 billion. That's a 4% decrease as reported or 1.3% on a constant basis. Favorable price/mix in the quarter was offset by reduced volume and unfavorable FX. The decrease was primarily driven by weakness In the U.S. as residential markets slowed more than expected in the quarter. Gross margin, as reported, was 20.9% and excluding one-time items, was 22.4% versus 26.8% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher inflation of $263 million, offset by stronger price/mix of $269 million and productivity of $16 million. The fourth quarter margin was further negatively impacted by a weaker volume of $95 million, temporary plant shutdowns of $69 million and FX headwinds of $12 million.SG&amp;A as reported was 18.6% of sales. And excluding one-time items was 17.9%, inline with the prior year. On dollar basis, the favorable impact of FX of $12 million and volume of $3 million was partially offset by price/mix of $6 million and inflation of $3 million. Operating margin as reported was 2.3% for the quarter. Restructuring and one-time charges, $58 million, including initiatives in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World and our disclosed litigation settlements. The restructuring charges combined the initiatives announced in Q2 and a new project in Flooring Rest of the World to better align our LVT assets with market conditions. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 4.5%, and the year-over-year decline in operating income was primarily driven by higher inflation of $266 million, offset by price/mix of $263 million, productivity of $15 million, lower start-up and other items of $8 million, although these were not enough to counter the weaker volume of $92 million and increasing temporary plant shutdowns of $69 million.Interest expense for the quarter was $15 million, and other income -- other expense was a $10 million expense due to unfavorable impact of transactional FX. In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 12.6% versus 18.9% in the prior year. We are forecasting the full year 2023 tax rate to be between 21% and 22% with some quarterly variations. Earnings per share, as reported, was $0.52 and excluding charges, was $1.32. Turning to the segments. Global Ceramics had sales of $988 million, that's a 4% increase as reported and 5% on a constant basis. Actions to drive favorable price and mix across the segment and improved year-over-year volume in the U.S. offset weakening unit volumes in other geographies. Operating income, excluding charges, was $70 million, which is a 16.7% increase versus prior year and operating margin at 7.1% improved 70 basis points due to improved price/mix of $111 million, productivity gains of $17 million and favorable FX and other items of $8 million, offsetting the increase in inflation of $85 million, lower volume of $28 million and related increased temporary plant shutdowns of $14 million.Flooring North America had sales of $946 million. That's a 6.8% decrease versus prior year as weaker volumes was only partially offset by favorable price/mix. The volume decrease was primarily a result of declines in residential channels and customers lowering inventory levels with consumers deferring discretionary spending. On an adjusted basis, Flooring North America's operating margin was approximately breakeven. The year-over-year decline in profitability was driven by weakening volume of $32 million, Temporary plant shutdowns of $33 million, and the impact of higher cost inventory and other inflation flowing through the P&amp;L of $109 million, only being partially offset by price/mix of $71 million and productivity of $8 million. We expect many of these issues to carryover to Q1 then in Q2 with seasonally stronger sales, lower costs and increased production levels, we should see a solid improvement in profitability.And finally, Flooring Rest of the World had sales of $717 million. That's a 9.9% decrease as reported and 2% on a constant basis. Installation products continued with strong growth in the quarter, but it was not enough to compensate for declines seen in the flooring categories, primarily laminate and LVT as inflation resulted in consumers reducing discretionary spending and in turn, customers lowering inventory levels. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 7.7% for the quarter. Operating income declined versus prior year. It was a result of the decrease in volumes of $32 million, temporary plant shutdowns of $22 million, which contributed to lower productivity of $10 million and increases in inflation of $79 million, only partially offset by price/mix actions of $81 million for the quarter.With the business concentrated in residential channels, we expect a number of these issues to impact Q1, which results improving as we move through the year as lower energy and material costs should drive higher consumer spending. Corporate and eliminations was $6 million in Q4 and $37 million for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet. The company generated free cash flow of $91 million in the fourth quarter and over $165 million in the second half of 2022. Receivables for the quarter ended at $1.9 billion with the DSO at 60 days versus 56 days in the prior year, due in part to customer and channel mix. Inventories ended at just under $2.8 billion or a 17% increase versus prior year, but declined 4% versus the third quarter. The year-over-year growth in inventory was primarily due to a spike in inflation.And sequentially, the decrease is primarily due to lowering of production levels to better align with demand. Inventory days ended at 138 days for the current year versus 131 in the third quarter. Property, plant and equipment ended at just shy of $4.7 billion and capital for the quarter was $151 million versus D&amp;A of $159 million. For the full year, CapEx ended at $581 million and D&amp;A of $595 million. Our current view for 2023 is a forecast of $560 million for CapEx and D&amp;A of $592 million, but we will adjust with the changing environment. And finally, the company maintains a strong overall balance sheet with gross debt of $2.8 billion and leverage at 1.3 times adjusted EBITDA. This strength gives us the flexibility to manage through the challenging environment.And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.Christopher Wellborn: Thank you, Jim. The Global Ceramic segment increased sales and earnings with a higher mix of new residential construction and commercial sales than our overall business. Residential ceramic sales in all geographies are slowing and operating margins are contracting due to lower volumes and manufacturing shutdowns. The cost of energy and transportation are declining, which will benefit our margins as these costs flow through our inventory. In the U.S., Ceramic sales and volume both increased as we benefited from our premium product offering, price increases and growing countertop business. Our collections with larger sizes and unique finishes, combined with specialized structures and shapes are enhancing our sales and mix.We're increasing our sales efforts in growing categories, including health care, hospitality and fitness as well as multifamily and build-for-rent homes. Cost inflation increased as higher energy and transportation expenses from prior periods were incurred. We are optimizing material supply chains and reengineering formulations to improve our costs. We reduced our inventories during the quarter by lowering production and enhancing our import strategies. We are reducing discretionary spending and limiting capital investments. To support additional growth in our quartz countertop sales, we are adding manufacturing capacity by the end of this year. Our countertop mix continues to improve as we expand our premium collections featuring our advanced painting technology.Wood, Floor, HousePhoto by Thanos Pal on UnsplashOur Ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure with slowing demand, customer inventory reductions and inflation. Our cost in the quarter were impacted by peak energy prices in the third quarter and reductions in plant volumes from temporary shutdowns. We are receiving energy subsidies in Italy, but we remain disadvantaged to some competitors who have long-term energy contracts. Natural gas prices have declined substantially, though disruptions could impact future costs. As Ceramic sales slow, the market is becoming more competitive. We are introducing new technologies to enhance surface textures, expand design capabilities and improve our costs. We are completing the expansion of our large porcelain slabs to support continued growth and enhance our styling.We have successfully reformulated our body composition to use alternative materials. Sales in both Mexico and Brazil decelerated in the quarter as inflation and increasing interest rates reduced residential demand. We anticipate continued near-term weakness and have reduced production levels in both countries. To cover inflation, we are managing mix and pricing. Natural gas prices in the regions are declining in line with the worldwide market and will lower cost as it flows through inventory. We have completed the acquisition of Elizabeth in Brazil and are awaiting regulatory approval to close Vitromex in Mexico. These acquisitions will position us as top producer in two of the world's largest ceramic markets. We anticipate significant synergies in all aspects of the businesses, which will enhance our sales and margins.We should be well positioned to leverage our combined strengths when the markets emerge from this downturn. During the fourth quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment was impacted by high inflation in energy prices and consumers reduced investments in Home Improvement. This caused a decline in Residential sales, which comprise a majority of the segment's business. As consumer spending slowed, our customers further reduced their inventory levels, which lowered market demand even more. In response, we implemented temporary plant shutdowns and reduced our inventory levels, compressing our margins. Natural gas prices in Europe peaked at an unprecedented level in the third quarter, raising our material and production costs. Our pricing and mix did not fully cover inflation, which remains a headwind.We remain focused on optimizing volume with selective promotions as well as controlling costs until the business improves. To enhance our competitive position, we are increasing our supply chain from outside the European Union. We have initiated additional restructuring actions to align with current conditions. Since the beginning of 2023, gas prices have declined substantially and material costs should follow. Assuming this trend holds, Europe should see lower overall inflation with higher wages, consumer spending should increase. During the quarter, all of our European Flooring categories experienced significant volume declines with many residential remodeling projects being postponed as inflation eroded consumer discretionary spending. Our product/mix was impacted as homeowners purchased lower-priced flooring to maintain their budgets.We are launching new product collections and expanding promotional activities to improve our sales. Higher cost inventory will compress our margins until it flows through our costs. Our sheet vinyl sales outperformed our other flooring categories as consumers chose lower-priced alternatives. We are improving the small polish sheet vinyl plant we acquired in the third quarter by increasing its output, reducing its cost and expanding its distribution. We are expanding our rigid LVT offering as it takes some share from flexible. We are increasing our existing operations and improving our formulation to lower our costs. We're adding new rigid production that make smaller runs with additional patented features. We will phase out of the residential-flexible LVT products and will close the supporting production.The cost of this new restructuring initiative is approximately $45 million with a cash cost of approximately $7.5 million, resulting in annualized cost savings of $15 million and significantly increased sales. Our Insulation business is growing as conserving energy has become a higher priority and building requirements have increased. We selectively increased pricing to cover higher material costs, and we lowered production in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory levels. We are growing our sales and distribution in the U.K. as we start up our new insulation plan. Our Panels business has faced the same pressures as our other categories with softening demand and rising material prices. During the quarter, our customers continued to reduce their inventory levels, further impacting our sales.Anticipating higher winter wood and energy costs, we maintained our inventory levels going into the first quarter. Our investments in green energy have benefited our performance by reducing our reliance on higher cost gas and electricity. The integration of our recent mezzanine acquisition in Germany is progressing as planned. We are defining best practices and utilizing our own manufacturing to replace source boards. Our business in Australia and New Zealand are slowing with the local economies as inflation and mortgage rates are impacting foreign sales. We are taking actions to align our cost and inventory levels with the expected volume decline. We have announced additional price increases and are initiating selective promotions to maximize our sales.We are updating our product offering and enhancing our merchandising to capture greater market share. As in other categories, commercial sales are stronger than residential and we are increasing our participation in specified projects. For the quarter, Flooring North America sales decreased faster than anticipated, primarily due to declines in residential channels, rug and customer inventory reductions. With inflation and interest rates at high levels, many consumers defer discretionary spending or traded down to lower cost products. Earnings in the segment were compressed due to lower sales, consumption of higher-cost materials, reduced inventory levels and temporary plant shutdowns. Our hard surface products outperformed soft and the commercial sector remains stronger than residential with hospitality showing the most growth.In response to slower market conditions, we are completing our restructuring actions, deferring capital projects and reducing discretionary spending. During 2022, we reduced our costs through process enhancements and rationalization of less efficient facilities while absorbing historically high inflation. We continue to adjust our strategies to manage the near-term market conditions, reductions in energy and materials should become a tailwind in the second quarter. Our commercial business remains solid as remodeling and new construction projects continue. We maintained strong margins in the quarter with pricing and mix offsetting inflation. Our flexible LVT products are a preferred alternative that provides versatile styling with easy installation.The combination of our carpet tile and LVT collections enables the customization of commercial spaces with unique designs. Our integration of a small flooring accessories acquisition is proceeding well. The company produces rubber baseboards and stair treads used in commercial installations and broadens our current flooring accessory business. In the fourth quarter, sales of residential soft services declined more than other categories, sales weakened as retailers reduced inventory with declining consumer sentiment and home sales. The multifamily channel was the strongest performer, and we are realigning resources focused more on this sector. As demand dropped in the quarter, we increased temporary shutdowns, which resulted in higher, unabsorbed costs.We have significantly lowered inventories in the fourth quarter and are reducing costs by eliminating less efficient manufacturing, enhancing productivity and adjusting production to demand. Participation in our recent flooring roadshows was at a record level with leading retailers expressing optimism about the year ahead. Our rug sales were lower as national retailers continue to adjust inventories with reduced consumer spending. We are restructuring our rug operations to lower cost and align production with demand. The integration of our nonwoven rug and carpet acquisition is progressing well and provides new opportunities with our existing customers. Our resilient sales grew in the quarter as we leveraged our WetProtect and antimicrobial technologies to differentiate our collections.We offset inflation through pricing and mix, though increased plant shutdowns resulted in higher unabsorbed costs and lower margins. We are introducing new collections to expand our offering while eliminating less productive SKUs. Our sheet vinyl sales were higher as consumers pursued budget friendly flooring options and the multifamily channel strengthened. The first phase of our new West Coast LVT plant is operating at expected levels. We are preparing new technologies that will improve our cost and add differentiated features. We will install additional production lines and train personnel throughout this year. Our Premium Laminate sales were impacted by slowing retail traffic and customer inventory adjustment. Our laminate is gaining acceptance as an alternative waterproof product in all channels.During the quarter, we offset inflation through pricing and mix, though our margins were impacted by lower absorption from temporary shutdowns as we reduced our inventory. We are beginning to see reductions in material inflation, which should help us recover our costs. Our new manufacturing line, which began last year, is operating at planned levels and will deliver our next generation of laminate features. With its industry-leading design and performance, our laminate business is in an excellent position to capitalize on the growing waterproof flooring category. Now I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.Jeff Lorberbaum: Thank you, Chris. The flooring industry is slowing due to higher interest rates, sustained inflation and low consumer confidence. The visibility of the depth and duration of this cycle is limited and conditions differ across the world. Mohawk has a strong record of managing these downturns by proactively executing the necessary actions. We're adjusting our business for the current conditions by reducing production level, inventory, cost structures and capital expenditures. We're implementing restructuring actions in both Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World to streamline operations, reduce SG&amp;A and rationalize higher-cost assets. In the first quarter, we anticipate more pressure on pricing and mix due to the low industry volumes.Our inventory costs remain elevated in most products due to the higher material and energy that we incurred in earlier periods. Additionally, we will not raise production as normal in the first quarter to prepare for future demand, increasing our unabsorbed costs. Our cost of energy have fallen and should benefit our global margins as our inventory turn. Our second quarter results should have sequentially stronger improvement with seasonally higher sales, increased production and lower material costs. Significantly lower cost of energy in Europe should enhance consumer spending, discretionary purchases and flooring demand. We're refocusing our sales teams on the channels that are performing the best in the current environment. We're introducing new innovative collections and merchandising as well as targeted promotions to improve sales.Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter EPS to be between $1.24 and $1.34, excluding restructuring and other charges. Around the world, the long-term demand for housing will require significant investments in new construction and remodeling. Mohawk is uniquely positioned with a comprehensive array of innovative products, industry-leading distribution and strength in all sales channels. We're implementing structural changes to navigate the industry's challenges while optimizing our future results. We anticipate coming out of this downturn in a stronger position as we benefit from our bolt-on acquisitions, enhanced market positions in Brazil and Mexico and strategic expansion of our high-growth product categories. Our balance sheet is well positioned to manage the current cycle and to drive future growth and profitability.We'll now be glad to take your questions.See also 15 Most Sustainable Companies in the World and 10 Largest Prisons in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.Jim Bidzos: Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. Throughout 2022, we delivered strong financial results while continuing to strengthen our critical Internet infrastructure. We complied with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements and extended our record of .com and .net DNS availability to over 25 years. I'd like to thank our team for their dedicated efforts, which enabled us to realize these results. The critical infrastructure we operate provides to the domain name system navigation service which people around the world depend on for commerce, work from home, education, healthcare and much more.Story continuesDuring 2022, we acknowledged the uncertainty that macroeconomic and other challenges beyond our ability to influence presented and we said that we would focus on what was within our ability to control. We also indicated what that meant. First, reliably maintaining operating and investing in our critical Internet infrastructure. Next, exercising careful expense control where appropriate. And additionally, it meant keeping focused on long-term value creation and efficient return of capital. During 2022, revenue grew 7.3% year-over-year and operating income by 8.8% year-over-year. Additionally, shares outstanding at the end of 2022 decreased by 4.8% from those outstanding at the end of 2021. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $980 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year.During the full year of 2022, we repurchased 5.5 million shares for $1 billion. At year-end, $859 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. At the end of 2022, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 173.8 million domain names with a year-over-year growth rate of 0.2%. In the fourth quarter, there were 9.7 million new registrations compared to 9.9 million last quarter and 10.6 million in the year ago quarter. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, we saw lower new registrations during 2022 as a result of factors that I've already mentioned in prior calls. These include pandemic-driven acceleration of new registrations in 2020 and 2021 which has subsided, global macroeconomic headwinds, reduced new registrations from China and lower first-time renewal rates.Internet, Connecting, SurfingPhoto by Leon Seibert on UnsplashWe believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 will be approximately 73.2% compared to the 73.7% final renewal rate last quarter and 74.8% a year ago. For the full year 2022, the renewal rate for previously renewed names remained similar year-over-year. However, first-time renewal rates were lower year-over-year with the largest single driver being names renewing from China, which were registered during 2021. Looking to 2023, our expected 2023 domain name base growth rate is between 0% and 2.5%. This guidance reflects our knowledge about our domain name base, our channel and the broader macroeconomic backdrop. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.62 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the price from $8.97 to $9.59, effective September 1, 2023.Even after this increase, we believe .com will remain highly competitive with other TLD choices. As a reminder, any of our domains may be registered for terms of up to 10 years at the current price. While we do not guide to pricing changes, I can say, as I did last year, that under the limited pricing flexibility we have the wholesale price of a .com registration cannot exceed $10.26 until at least October of 2026. Turning to web. The parties made their submissions to ICANN during Q3 and we are still waiting for ICANN to complete its process. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks.George Kilguss: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the company generated revenue of $1.425 billion, up 7.3% and delivered operating income of $943 million, up 8.8% from 2021. Operating expense totaled $482 million and was up 4.6% from the prior year compared to a similar 4.5% increase experienced in fiscal 2021. The full year 2022 operating margin was 66.2% and free cash flow was $804 million. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the company generated revenue of $369 million, up 8.5% from the same quarter of 2021 and delivered operating income of $245 million, up 10.5% from the same quarter a year ago. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we executed a transition of the .tv agreement to a new registry operator.As the proposed contract terms in the new .tv request for proposal, no longer aligned with our strategic framework, we decided not to participate in the RFP. Revenue related to this agreement during the full year of 2022 was approximately $19 million, of which approximately $10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. Operating expense in Q4 totaled $124 million compared to $118 million a year earlier. Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $179 million compared to $330 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $2.97 for the same quarter of 2021. As a reminder, net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 included the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit related to the transfer of certain non-U.S. intellectual properties between wholly-owned subsidiaries which increased net income by $165.5 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.49.Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $217 million, and free cash flow was $209 million compared with $206 million and $193 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2021. I will now discuss our full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion. This revenue range reflects our expectation that the domain name base will grow at a rate between 0% and 2.5% as Jim mentioned and is also impacted by the transition of the .tv agreement at the end of 2022. Operating income is expected to be between $985 million and $1.05 billion. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is expected to be an expense of between $35 million to $45 million.Capital expenditures in 2023 are also expected to be in a range between $35 million to $45 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 25%. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2023. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. We believe our strategic focus and disciplined management served us well during 2022, allowing us to deliver solid financial results in a challenging environment as the economy struggled to recover from disruption caused by the pandemic. VeriSign's mission is about security and stability, not only in the operation of our critical infrastructure, but financial stability is also important for our customers, employees and shareholders. Today, we reported profitable revenue growth for 2022, and we guided to profitable revenue growth for 2023. This was possible through modest domain name base growth, limited pricing flexibility and responsible expense management. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of our business remain strong.As I said earlier, our strategy prioritizes reliable, uninterrupted operation of our critical infrastructure, along with long-term value creation and its efficient return to shareholders with consistent, efficient management. We believe this strategy will serve all of our constituents well for the long term, and you can expect us to maintain this focus. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.See also 25 Safest Countries for Solo Female Travelers and 15 Most Sustainable Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Lisa?Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2022 is a really good year for Regency, and we ended it on a high note with solid fourth quarter results on all fronts. Our strong performance is a testament to the quality of our shopping centers, the health and resiliency of our tenants and the hard work of our team. We enter 2023 with great momentum in our leasing pipelines fueled by strong tenant demand as we continue to have success growing rents across our portfolio. This persistent strength in the operating environment also continues to support the economics of our development and redevelopment projects. We look forward to further growing that pipeline over the next several years. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the challenging macroeconomic backdrop is bringing with it more tenant bankruptcies and early store closures, which have been relatively light for the last couple of years.But importantly, our exposure to at-risk tenants is limited. This is not by accident. It is a product of many years of intentionally cultivating our portfolio of neighborhood centers and strong suburban trade areas. And where we do have exposure, we see upside opportunities in getting spaces back and taking advantage of the strong leasing environment. Additionally, with inflation moderating, along with some stabilization in the capital markets, we believe we have more clarity on the impacts to our business from the economic environment than we did three months ago. These factors underscore our conviction in our 2023 outlook. Shifting to the private transaction markets, we are starting to see increased activity. Transaction volumes remain thin, but with financing markets stabilizing and treasuries reversing course, competitive bidding situations are returning for high-quality grocery-anchored centers.We believe this validates our portfolio and our investment strategy as shopping centers with a focus on necessity, convenience and value are more resistant to impacts from economic cycles. A couple of final thoughts before I turn it over to Alan. In addition to the stability and steadiness of grocery-anchored shopping centers, the open-air sector generally has really benefited from structural tailwinds coming out of the pandemic, lifting all boats with the rising tide. While we do expect those tailwinds to continue, we believe that 2023 can really shine a spotlight on Regency's attributes, allowing us to separate from the pack. These attributes include the quality and locations of our real estate, our tenant credit, our balance sheet strength and liquidity and the hard work and dedication of our amazing team.In our business, you win on the meaningful margin by making solid operating and investment decisions every day that generate steady and sustainable growth. It's how we create value for our shareholders and this is reflected in Regency's long track record of outperformance in cash flow and dividend growth. Alan?Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. The retail operating environment remains healthy, and we ended the year with another strong quarter. I'm really proud of our 2022 results. We had an exceptional year in leasing, helping to drive strong occupancy gains with our leased rate up 80 basis points and our commenced rate up 110 basis points over levels one year ago. Notably, our year-end 2022 same-property lease rate is back to our 2019 level of 95.1%. But make no mistake, we still have room to run and we aim to ultimately get back closer to peak levels of 96% or higher. The primary driver was our record year for shop space leasing ending the year up 200 basis points with our shop lease rate now 70 basis points above 2019.I am especially proud of the shop occupancy recovery considering the many challenges we faced during the pandemic. Our tenant retention rate remains above historical averages, bad debt as a percent of revenues is back to pre-COVID levels. And importantly, our GAAP and net effective rent spreads were in the mid-teens for the year due to our team's accomplishments of achieving initial cash rent spreads north of 7%, embedding contractual rent steps in the majority of our leases and maintaining our track record of judicious leasing capital spend. All of these positive trends and the progress we've made contributed to another strong year of same-property NOI growth of 6.3%, excluding COVID-related reserve collections and term fees. At year-end, our signed but not occupied pipeline of 230 basis points represents more than $34 million of annual base rent, giving us positive momentum into 2023.Importantly, as leases commence, we continue to replenish this pipeline with newly executed leases. We have seen strong tenant demand continuing in the New Year, and our LOI and lease negotiation pipelines remain full. Our most active categories include restaurants, health and wellness, veterinary, grocers and off-price. We are hearing from top national retailers that their appetite to expand outpaces the quality inventory available today which bodes well for Regency's high-quality portfolio. As we all know from recent headlines, tenant bankruptcies and early store closures will be more impactful as we think about move-outs in 2023. Among retailers that have recently filed for bankruptcy, Party City comprises only 20 basis points of ABR over 6 stores, and we have only one Regal Cinema, which is less than 10 basis points of ABR.In the context of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's recently announced store closures, at year-end, we had 11 stores comprising 60 basis points of ABR. We had one of those expire naturally in January, and of the closures announced last week, we had five locations on the list. Within our 2023 guidance range, we've embedded assumptions for credit loss associated with these bankruptcy filings and store closure announcements which Mike will discuss in more detail. But all of that said, we believe our overall exposure to at-risk tenants is relatively limited. Our current tenant base is healthier than ever as a result of being intentional in the centers that we own and thoughtful in our merchandising process. And whatever the outcome of the at-risk tenants, we feel really good about the quality of our real estate.Tenant bankruptcies are a normal part of our business. And to the extent we get stores back from underperforming retailers, we have opportunities to mark-to-market rents and upgrade the merchandising mix at our centers. To that end, our teams are already negotiating with replacement tenants at higher rents for all of the known closures. In summary, our strong Q4 results and the trends we are experiencing today provide positive momentum into 2023. Nick?Buildings, Real estate, BuyingPhoto by Ronnie George on UnsplashNick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Last year, we successfully executed on our development and redevelopment strategy. Even with pressures from rising construction costs, we continue to achieve solid returns on our investments that will provide earnings accretion in years to come. To that end, we completed more than $120 million of projects with over $100 million of those completions in the fourth quarter. These include East San Marco, our public-anchored ground-up development here in Jacksonville. The property is 100% leased and outperformed original expectations on all metrics, including timing, cost and rents. Carytown Exchange in Richmond, Virginia is another public-anchored ground-up development.We split this project into two phases during the pandemic and recently completed construction on the second phase. We've had great leasing success at Carytown with tenants such as Torchy's Tacos, Jenny's Ice Cream, Burton's Grill and Starbucks. Preston Oaks is the redevelopment of an HEB-anchored center in Dallas. We were able to significantly upgrade the center in the merchandising mix by adding vibrant new shop tenants, including Mendocino Farms, Heyday and Everybody, and the property is now 100% leased. Out at Serramonte Center, we completed the first two phases of our redevelopment project during the fourth quarter. These phases included the interior mall renovation as well as the addition of Chick-fil-A and Starbucks outparcels. Future phases of this project, including the addition of two exterior buildings and the redevelopment of the former JC Penney space are expected to start in the second half of 2023.In addition to our completions, we've also made great progress on our in-process development and redevelopments, which totaled $300 million at year-end. Highlights include our Whole Foods-anchored Town &amp; Country redevelopment in Los Angeles. We discussed this project in detail a quarter ago, but construction has commenced in the fourth quarter and demolition of the former Kmart building is nearly complete. Additionally, at our Glenwood Green development in Old Bridge, New Jersey, construction is on schedule with Target's anticipated opening later this year, and we expect Shoprite to open in early 2024. The team continues to do an excellent job of managing costs and keeping our projects on time and on budget. In total, we believe our accretive development and redevelopment program remains on track to deliver $15 million of incremental NOI in 2023 and 2024.Beyond our in-process projects, I'm really encouraged by the progress we're making growing our shadow pipelines. We're focused on building our pipelines through sourcing new ground-up development projects, new redevelopment projects through value-add acquisitions, as well as continuing to unlock redevelopment opportunities in our existing portfolio. We also continue to engage meaningfully with developers that are facing financing challenges, which could create additional joint venture opportunities. In totality, we have the key ingredients necessary to grow our program, including robust tenant demand, long-standing retailer relationships, experienced development teams in top markets around the country. Importunately, we have the ability to self-fund this growth with free cash flow.We believe the combination of these capabilities are unequaled, and we look forward to sharing additional details as we advance these opportunities. Mike?Michael Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some highlights from our Q4 and full year results, then walk through our 2023 guidance and assumptions before ending with some color on our balance sheet position. Our strong performance last year was underpinned by growth in NOI and more specifically from base rent growth. Excluding the collection of 2020 and 2021 reserves, which I'll refer to today as COVID collections, we delivered same-property NOI growth of 5.8% in the fourth quarter and 6.3% for the full year. Again, most importantly, we saw a 3.6% contribution from base rent growth in 2022, accelerating to 4.8% in the fourth quarter. This growth in base rent over the last year has been driven by contractual rent steps, mark-to-market on re-leasing, increases in occupancy and commencement of rent from redevelopment projects.As Alan mentioned, our leased occupancy rate is now back to pre-pandemic levels, but our eyes are set even higher. COVID collections were about $2 million in the fourth quarter and totaled $20 million for the year. That's down from $46 million in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we converted another 2% of our tenants back to an accrual basis of accounting from cash, and as a result, recognized nearly $5 million of non-cash income from the reversal of straight-line rent reserves. We ended the year with 7% of our tenants remaining on a cash basis of accounting. For uncollectible lease income, in 2022, we were close to our historical average of 50 basis points on current year billings by nearly all metrics but for some limited exposure to higher profile potential bankruptcies, our in-place tenancy is about as strong as it's ever been.Looking ahead to 2023 and after excluding COVID collections, we are guiding to core operating earnings per share growth of close to 4% year-over-year at the midpoint. We'd like to point you to Slides 5 through 8 in our earnings presentation, which I'm certain you'll find extraordinarily helpful as you work through our outlook. We expect same property NOI growth, excluding COVID collections of 2% to 3%, which is the largest positive driver of earnings into 2023. The primary contributor continues to be base rent growth, driven by embedded rent steps, rent growth from new leasing and shop space commencement as well as the delivery of completed redevelopment projects. Importantly, our same-property NOI guidance range also assumes credit loss impact of roughly 75 to 100 basis points from anticipated tenant bankruptcies and early store closures, including from those tenants that Alan discussed.This credit loss impact includes an assumption that current year uncollectible lease income will be modestly above our pre-pandemic average of 50 basis points as well as the potential for occupancy to end the year flat to lower -- should bankruptcy-driven move-outs occur. Again, this range excludes any impact from COVID collections, which I'll discuss in a minute. As you think about reconciling NAREIT FFO of $4.10 last year to a guided midpoint of $4.07 in 2023. Remember that this metric continues to be significantly impacted by COVID era accounting adjustments, including the collection of rents previously reserved as well as the impact on non-cash revenues from converting tenants from cash to accrual. Our operating fundamentals continue to strengthen, as they have in 2022 and as they are expected to continue this year.And these pandemic-related items can mask our true growth in cash earnings. It's important to take this a step further this morning as these two items meaningfully impact year-over-year comparability. First, we are anticipating lower COVID collections of $3 million in 2023 compared to $20 million last year. And second, we are also anticipating lower non-cash revenues of $36 million at the midpoint in 2023 compared to $47 million in 2022. Please note that we increased our full year non-cash revenue guidance from $30 million a quarter ago to account for new information, including an assumption that we will continue converting tenants to accrual accounting in 2023, as well as the likelihood that we will recognize accelerated below-market rent amortization triggered by the potential for bankruptcy-related store closures.This is why we focus on core operating earnings, which strips out the noncash adjustments and also why we provide same-property NOI excluding COVID collections. With this added transparency, you can better see the underlying positive growth. Again, I encourage you to use the materials in our earnings presentation, as I'm certain you'll find it very helpful in evaluating these impacts. The good news is that we are fast approaching the point where these COVID-related impacts will no longer create meaningful noise in our reported results. To finish and to pivot from guidance, we feel great about how we are positioned from a balance sheet perspective with one of the strongest in the REIT sector at a time when it matters most. Our leverage is at the lower end of our targeted range of 5 times to 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA.And we expect to generate free cash flow north of $140 million this year, self-funding our development and redevelopment commitments. While the financing markets have moved in our favor over the last 3 months, we have no need to access the capital markets this year. Our revolving credit line was undrawn at year-end, and we have no unsecured debt maturities until mid-2024.

To skip our detailed analysis of inflation-resistant companies and sectors, you can go directly to see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.The worst economic recession recession recorded in recent history was the 2008 global financial crisis. The crisis began within the US housing market, with home prices rising rapidly in the late 1990s and exceeding income growth by 2000. This created a housing bubble consisting of record-breaking prices for housing in the US, which eventually burst and led to a market collapse for subprime mortgages. In the aftermath, the whole world was forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, with the after-effects of the crisis leaking into the global economy. By analysing the market in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, and later with additional market research post-COVID-19, financial researchers and analysts have managed to pinpoint several industries that fare well during an economic downturn.As a result, companies operating within these industries like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are often considered to be money-makers in times of recession. According to McKinsey report published in 2009, recession-resistant industries include consumer staples, healthcare, telecommunication services, and utilities, among more. In 2008, the total returns to shareholders fell for all sectors by over 20%, but consumer staples was an exception to this.A look at the utilities industry, another traditional recession-proof sector, clarified that companies operating in this area were also able to perform much better than others. KPMG's report on European power and utilities, published in 2021, showed that the deal value of the European power and utilities sector rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021. This came about as a result of higher power prices in the aftermath of the COVID-19 economic downturn. Another example of a fairly recession-resistant industry is the healthcare sector. Research shared by Cushman &amp; Wakefield shows that between 1967 and 2019, American spending on healthcare has been on the rise, even during the recessionary years of 2007-2009. Healthcare spending has been roughly doubling every 13 years, with it accounting for about 18% of the US GDP in 2019, up from 13% in 2000. Consumer spending also steadily rose in the healthcare industry for over 60 years. Between 1959 and 2019, the average annual growth rate was calculated at 3.7%. This stands in stark contrast to the general belief that consumer spending always drops during recessions, and goes to show that some industries can conversely benefit in times of recession, as they offer products and services that cannot be cut out of everyday life for most people.Story continues10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession.Let's now take a look at 10 companies and industries that make money during a recession.Our MethodologyWe have combined data from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis and Bloomberg to pick 10 companies that have proven to perform well during the global recession in 2008. To measure their resistance to recessions, we have considered their stock performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 during 2008, using Yahoo Finance's historical stock price data where needed. We also mentioned analyst price targets and ratings for the company's stocks. They are ranked based on their outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008, from the lowest to the highest percentage.Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 8.8%The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a world-renowned entertainment company. It operates through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments. The company is based in Burbank, California.On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall reiterated an Overweight rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares, alongside a $125 price target.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has diversified its business to include not only media entertainment but also recreational theme parks and experiences. One result of such diversification has been the company's resilience in times of economic turmoil. During the 2008 financial crisis, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 8.8%. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while Disney's theme parks and cruise business were shut down, Disney+ streaming subscriptions surged to include 73.7 million subscribers by November 2020, relative to the company's goal to reach between 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024. Such growth allowed the company to outperform the S&amp;P 500 by 9% in 2020 as well.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a recession-resistant company investors should look at today.9. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)Industry: Information TechnologyS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 9.9%Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is an application software company providing electronic design automation software products used in the design and testing of integrated circuits. The company is based in Mountain View, California.Peter Sazel at Atlantic Equities re-initiated coverage of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) shares on January 17 with an Overweight rating and a $390 price target.Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a leading technology company that offers a platform for the testing of semiconductor chips and software applications. Analysts consider the semiconductor industry to be a secular growth market, meaning the demand for chip testing and designing services is likely to remain constant even during recessions. This belief is supported by the performance of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) during the 2008 recession when the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 9.9%. Even during the market downturn in 2020, the company outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 70%.TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, mentioned Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“New to the strategy this quarter was Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), a provider of electronic design automation software products used to design and test integrated circuits. The electronic design automation market is a essentially a duopoly with one other major player in the space. As such, the barriers to entry are very high and will likely remain that way due to rising chip complexity.”8. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS)Industry: Communication ServicesS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 14.8%T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is a wireless telecommunication services company providing mobile communications services in the US, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company is based in Bellevue, Washington.An Overweight rating was reiterated on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) shares on January 5 by analyst Philip Cusick at JPMorgan. The analyst also placed a $200 price target on the stock.T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) has become the second-largest US wireless provider after its merger with Sprint. The company managed to beat the odds during the global 2008 recession by outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by 14.8%. It also outperformed the benchmark index by 55.7% in 2020. Since T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) is now an even more significant player in the communication services industry, it may prove to be recession-resistant in the coming years as well, due to its ability to outgrow its primary competitors.7. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Industry: Movies and EntertainmentS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 21.37%Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another entertainment and streaming company on our list. It offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and more on its platform. The company has recently also added mobile games across different genres and languages to its arsenal of products.Joseph Bonner at Argus holds a Buy rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares as of January 23. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $340 to $390.Between October 9, 2007, and March 9, 2009, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) brought in a total return of 68.9%, according to Bloomberg. The company is also a lower-cost entertainment option compared to peers like The Walt Disney Company, ensuring that during recessions, consumers on the lookout for cheaper entertainment options would gravitate toward it. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 21.37% in 2008, and its subscriber growth increased by 26% to 9.3 million during the same year. This shows that the company was able to actually perform better during an economic downturn.Polen Capital, an investment management company, mentioned Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has nearly doubled since its May 2022 lows and was our top performer for both the quarter and the year. In the summer, we added to our position meaningfully after our research indicated that the company’s two new monetization levers (requiring fees for shared passwords and the introduction of an advertising-supported subscription) would be very additive to the company’s revenue and profits beginning in early 2023. The company has since announced plans to disallow password sharing, which should provide a boost to revenue and profit growth nearly immediately as account holders or those that are borrowing passwords are required to pay to continue to watch Netflix content. The ad-supported subscription tier should also be a clear positive, not only for the company’s financials but also for consumers and marketers alike. While the subscription fee for the ad-supported tier is only about $7/month in the U.S., the ad revenue per subscriber that Netflix earns for consumers choosing this option could easily add another $15 per month or more in the U.S., potentially making Netflix’s ad-supported subscription tier the company’s most revenue generative and profitable. Even if more premium subscribers than expected downgrade to the adsupported option, we think there should be significant revenue uplift for Netflix. It appears market participants have been doing this math as well, driving the stock price higher over the last seven months.”6. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Industry: Home Improvement RetailS&amp;P 500 Outperformance in 2008: 23.9%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a consumer discretionary company operating Home Depot stores across the US. The company sells home improvement products, maintenance, repair, and operations products, and much more. It is based in Atlanta, Georgia.On December 13, Max Rakhlenko at Cowen reiterated an Outperform rating on The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $350 to $379.Typically, sales for a company like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) would fall during a recession because of decreased consumer spending. However, the company is well-versed in allocating capital in a way that grows its value. Over the past 10 years, the company's profit margin increased from 6% to 11%. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 23.9% in 2008. Additionally, in 2020 it was seen that interest rate cuts and a lack of entertainment activities in 2020 actually led to a boom in the housing and home improvement markets. So in 2020, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) outperformed the benchmark index by 5.3% as well.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), is a company that has managed to beat the odds during recessions in the past, making it a safe option for investors as well.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Companies and Industries That Make Money During a Recession. Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for RecessionJim Cramer's Recession-Proof Stocks14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A RecessionDisclosure: None. 10 Companies and Industries That Make Money During A Recession is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Good morning, everyone and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Before we begin our discussion on our results and our plans for 2023, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the announcement we made in January regarding the promotion of Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby to Co-Presidents. Our company is extremely focused on identifying and developing leaders who in turn are relentless in building the very best team in our industry. Our long-term commitment to succession planning is a critical component of our human capital strategy. In line with that strategy, we are extremely pleased to have Brent and Brad assume the elevated positions of Co-Presidents. Brad and Brent are exceptional leaders and are both driven by their passion for perpetuating our O'Reilly culture and providing excellent service to our customers.Story continuesBrad and Brent bring diverse and broad experience to their roles of Co-President. Brad's career with O'Reilly began 26 years ago when he joined the company as a parts specialist in Wagoner, Oklahoma. He has progressed through every leadership role in our store operations group, from Store Manager through Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales, before assuming the role of EVP and Chief Operating Officer and now Co-President. Brad's leadership has been instrumental in the growth and expansion of our company and his impact is evident throughout the leadership ranks of our operational teams, many of whom have been mentored and promoted directly by Brad. As Co-President, Brad is responsible for the company's domestic and international store operations and sales, real estate and expansion, human resources, training, legal, risk management, loss prevention and finance.Like Brad, Brent brings decades of retail leadership experience to his role as Co-President. Brent began his 35-year retail career with Lowe's Companies and progressed through their ranks, ultimately serving in the roles of Senior Vice President of Store Operations, Chief Omnichannel Officer, and Chief Supply Chain Officer. Brent joined Team O'Reilly in 2018 as our Senior Vice President of omnichannel and made an immediate impact in that role before assuming leadership of our supply chain and distribution efforts. His extensive experience and significant DIY and professional retail industry knowledge is critical to our efforts to enhance our industry-leading inventory position, leverage technology investments to deliver powerful tools for our team, and drive deep connections with our DIY and professional customers.As Co-President, Brent is responsible for the company's distribution operations, logistics, merchandising, inventory management, pricing, advertising, omnichannel, customer satisfaction, program management, electronic catalog, and information technology. Again, I am very pleased to have Brad and Brent step into these new roles and I am excited about the leadership they will provide to Team O'Reilly as Co-Presidents. Brad and Brent are participating on the call with me this morning, along with Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I am once again pleased to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking year in 2022.We finished the year with incredible momentum, posting a comparable store sales increase of 9% in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of almost 35% on a 3-year stack basis. For the full year of 2022, our team generated a robust 6.4% comparable store sales growth, which came in above the revised guidance range of 4.5% to 5.5% we provided last quarter and above the midpoint of our original comp range of 5% to 7% we said at the beginning of 2022. Even more impressive, our 6.4% comparable store sales growth in 2022 followed record-setting sales growth in 2021 and 2020 when we delivered comps of 13.3% and 10.9% respectively, resulting in 3-year stacked comps exceeding 30%. These strong top line results drove another year of record earnings per share as diluted EPS increased 8% to $33.44, representing a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 23%.Our ability to continue to grow our business and capture market share year-in and year-out is a testament to our team's commitment to providing excellent customer service and we couldn't be more pleased with how our team finished 2022. Entering 2023, we remain bullish on the opportunities we see ahead of us and are anticipating another strong year of sales and earnings growth. For earnings per share, we have established the guidance for 2023 at $35.75 to $36.25, representing an increase of 8% versus 2022 at the midpoint. Achievement of our 2023 guidance would result in us doubling our EPS over the last 4 years, representing a compounded annual growth rate over 19%. This impressive performance and challenging target is a testament to the quality of our team and their commitment to our customers.Brad, Brent and Jeremy will walk through the rest of our detailed outlook in their prepared comments. But for now, I will just say that we are excited about the aggressive plans we have to invest in our business and continue to take market share and drive industry-leading results. Before I turn the call over to Brad, I want to share a little bit about the incredible culture building experience our team just had in January at our Annual Leadership Conference in Dallas. Each year, we bring all of our store managers, field leadership as well as our sales and DC management team members together in one place at one time to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge, share best practices across our company, and celebrate our award-winning performance.The theme of this year's conference was: One Team, Reunited. And it was definitely an appropriate rallying cry for our first in-person leadership conference in 3 years. The passion and energy displayed by our company leaders was infectious and it gives us even more confidence in the Team O'Reilly's ability to drive future success through their unwavering commitment to our customers and fellow team members. To wrap up my prepared comments, I want to thank each of our team members for their dedication to our company's long-term success and their outstanding performance in 2022. I am extremely proud of all of you and I am confident 2023 will be another record-setting year for Team O'Reilly. I will now turn the call over to Brad.Brad Beckham: Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great year in 2022. Our team's focus on providing consistent, excellent customer service allowed us to generate the outstanding results we reported yesterday and we were excited about the opportunities we see to continue to grow our business. Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter comparable store sales results and outline our guidance for 2023. As we discussed on our third quarter conference call, we started the fourth quarter with strong sales volumes in line with trends we saw as we exited the third quarter. Those robust sales volumes continued through the end of the year, delivering results solidly above our expectations on both the professional and DIY sides of our business each month of the quarter.From a cadence perspective, the monthly comp was steady throughout the quarter with December being the strongest month of the quarter on a 2 and 3-year stack basis. As we finished the year, we saw broad-based strength across all of our markets in weather-related categories, such as batteries, cooling and antifreeze as well as our other core non-weather-related categories. We saw strength in both our DIY and professional businesses, with professional again leading the way with double-digit comparable store sales growth on robust increases in both ticket counts and average ticket size. As we finished 2022, we were very pleased with our professional performance and we believe the momentum we have created is the direct result of our team executing our proven business model at a high level and providing industry-leading customer service.We were also pleased to see the improved performance in our DIY business, which accelerated on a 1, 2 and 3-year comparable store sales growth basis, driven by our strong average ticket growth. As anticipated, DIY ticket counts were a partial offset to our comp growth due to difficult comparisons from strong traffic growth in the previous 2 years, but improved sequentially in quarter, continuing the trend we saw in the third quarter and exceeding our expectations. As we saw throughout 2022, growth in average ticket values drove our total comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter. Average ticket size grew in the high single-digits on both sides of our business, supported primarily by the mid single-digit growth in same SKU inflation and augmented by a benefit from increasing clean improved quality and design of new parts.On a year-over-year basis, we saw a moderation in the same SKU benefit after peaking in the second and third quarters as we lap the acceleration of higher inflation in 2021 and saw modest increases in selling prices as we finished out 2022. The moderation in selling price increases correlate with what we are seeing in product acquisition costs as industry pricing has remained rational on both sides of the business and we have been successful in passing through cost increases. Now, I want to transition to a discussion of our 2023 sales guidance and our outlook for this year. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we are establishing our annual comparable store sales guidance for 2023 at a range of 4% to 6%. And we want to provide some color on the factors that are driving our expectations as it relates to both our outlook for our industry as well as the specific opportunities we see for our company.I will begin with our view of the prospects for our industry, which we believe are still very favorable. The health of the automotive aftermarket continues to be supported by strength in the core fundamental drivers of demand and the last few years have further reinforced the compelling value proposition that motivates consumers to invest in their vehicles. Since the onset of the pandemic, the scarcity of vehicles has forced many consumers to keep their vehicles longer. These investments consumers have made to keep their vehicles well maintained have paid off and we expect to see a continued willingness by consumers to invest in their high-quality vehicles at higher and higher mileages. We also have a positive outlook on the strength of the consumer in our industry and their ongoing willingness to prioritize their transportation needs.We continue to view the health of our customers as strong, supported by extremely low unemployment and robust growth in wages over the past 2 years. We think these factors provide a solid backdrop for growth in miles driven in our industry and solid demand over the next year. While miles driven still remain below pre-pandemic levels, we have seen growth in this key fundamental for our industry over the past 18 months. We believe we will see a continuation of the long-term industry trend of steady growth in miles driven resulting from population growth and an increase in the size of the U.S. car park. As we think about the broader macro factors that could impact the U.S. economy in the coming year, we remain cautious in our outlook for  outlook concerning ongoing headwinds from inflation and the potential for deterioration in economic conditions.Negative trends in the broader economy can  it can influence demand in our industry in the short-term, but we have consistently seen over time that consumers adjust quickly in challenging environments. In fact, in 2022, it was a good illustration of how this can play out. The pressure we saw from elevated gas prices, broad-based inflation and global economic shocks weighed on our results versus our expectations in the first half of the year. However, our customers adjusted as conditions stabilized and our business rebounded to meet our full year sales growth expectations. Our experience through multiple economic cycles in our company's history is that consumers will prioritize the maintenance and the repair of their existing vehicles as a means to avoid a car payment and save money in the face of economic pressures.Ultimately, due to the non-discretionary and value-driven nature of our business, we have confidence our industry will perform well in 2023, even if we end up facing challenges in the broader economy. As confident as we are in the strength of our industry, the most important driver for our outlook for 2023 is the opportunity we see to outperform our competition and gain market share by out-executing  or excuse me, by executing our business model and providing the best customer service in the industry. To this end, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our outlook on both sides of our business. We expect both our DIY and professional businesses to be positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth in 2023, with professional again expected to outperform.We are excited about the strength we built in 2022 in our professional business and we believe this will continue to accelerate our growth on this side of the business. We remain highly committed to being the industry leader in the quality of service and inventory availability we provide to the professional customer and our focus moving into 2023 is to aggressively lever these strengths to further consolidate this side of the market. We also see significant opportunity to grow our DIY business, but are more cautious in how we view our ability to increase ticket counts on a year-over-year basis. Our DIY ticket counts in 2022 were pressured in comparison to 2021 as we were still calendaring the impact of government stimulus and faced headwinds from gas price shocks and inflation.We feel like we have now completely lapped the artificial spikes in demand and are pleased with the steady DIY traffic we saw in the back half of the year. While there has been a lot of volatility in our comparisons over the past 3 years, our overall growth in DIY ticket counts has been solidly positive in total during that timeframe. We have clearly taken market share since the onset of the pandemic through consistent execution and excellent service even as we face the long-term industry trend of pressure to DIY ticket counts. For 2023, we will continue to face this industry dynamic where increased complexity and quality of parts extend service and repair intervals. As a result, we anticipate DIY traffic down will be down slightly in 2023 with an expectation that we will continue to gain market share to partially offset the normal industry drag on ticket counts.We expect the pressure to DIY traffic to be more than offset by increased average ticket. We anticipate average ticket on both sides of our business to benefit from low single-digit inflation arising from the carryover benefit on a year-over-year basis as we compare against price levels that ramp throughout 2022. Consistent with our historical practice, we are including only modest increases in price levels from this point forward in 2023. We do not expect to see growth in average ticket values above and beyond same-SKU inflation, resulting from increased product complexity and our ability to trade customers up to a higher quality product on the good-better-best spectrum. As we move through 2023, we anticipate comps in the first half of the year to be stronger than the back half as a result of the year-over-year same-SKU inflation benefit as well as easier comparisons in professional ticket counts, which ramped throughout 2022, and to a lesser degree, DIY ticket counts which faced more pronounced pressure in the first half of last year.We are off to a strong start thus far in 2023 and we are pleased to see continued momentum on both sides of our business. Now I want to spend some time covering our SG&amp;A and operating profit performance in 2022 and our outlook for 2023 before turning the call over to Brent who will provide color on our gross margin. Fourth quarter SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of sales was 32.2%, in line with the fourth quarter of 2021. As we noted in our press release yesterday, this number includes a $28 million charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program for our team members. Average per store SG&amp;A for 2022 was just  was up just over 4.8%, driven by incremental variable operating expenses on better-than-expected sales volumes and cost inflation in fuel, wage rates and team member benefits.Over the last several years, our teams have demonstrated an ability to drive an enhanced level of profitability and productivity on our SG&amp;A spend as we are pleased with the finish to 2022. As we look forward to 2023, we are planning to grow average SG&amp;A per store by approximately 4.5%. This level of spend is a step change higher than we would normally forecast in our initial SG&amp;A guidance. While we anticipate facing some pressures to costs from ongoing inflation, the majority of our incremental spend anticipated in 2023 reflects deliberate decisions we are making to invest in our business. We are targeting initiatives we believe will enhance the value proposition we offer to both our team members and customers by investing in our professional parts people and our customer service levels, in turn, driving both long-term sales and operating profit dollar growth.We plan to deploy these resources to enhance our long-term operational strength with specific emphasis on strengthening our team member experience and benefits, upgrading our store vehicle fleet, refreshing and improving our store image and appearance, and deploying incremental technology projects as well as investments in infrastructure. We believe we have an opportunity to capitalize on our strong competitive position in our industry and further separate ourselves as we consolidate the market. We are highly confident our investment in these initiatives will provide strong long-term returns, but anticipate we will face initial pressure to our SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales in 2023. Based on these expectations, coupled with the normal drag from new store expansion and our anticipated gross margin rate, which Brent will discuss in a minute, we are setting our operating profit guidance range at 19.8% to 20.3% of sales.At the midpoint of our guidance, we are expecting operating profit to increase over 4%. Ultimately, our leadership team is focused on enhancing the excellent customer service and overall value that creates strong relationships with our customers on both sides of the business that, in turn, drive long-term growth in operating profits. To finish up my prepared comments, I want to add to what Greg has already said about the incredible experience we had as a leadership team in Dallas and the enthusiasm our team showed for our business and the O'Reilly culture. This was my 26th Leadership Conference, my first being in 1998 when I first became a Store Manager and there is no doubt in my mind, it was our best one yet. Since there was  since this was our first in-person conference since 2020, the last two being virtual, there was certainly a lot for us to celebrate, but I was blown away by the commitment I saw from our team to not rest on our laurels or be satisfied with our past success.Instead, our team was passionate about the opportunities we have in front of us. As we look forward to 2023 and set an ambitious plan to outperform the competition and gain market share, we will be aggressive in supporting our teams and equipping them with the tools and resources to drive our company to an even higher level of performance. I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company. Now I will turn the call over to Brent.See also 25 Largest Apparel Companies in the world and 30 Best Stocks for Retirement.Brent Kirby: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin my remarks today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on yet another strong year. Once again, your commitment to consistent, excellent customer service drove outstanding results in 2022. As Greg and Brad have already shared, it was a privilege to be able to get together with our industry-leading team professional parts people at our leadership conference in January, and we are all incredibly excited about the strength of our business moving forward in 2023. Today, I'm going to discuss our fourth quarter and full year gross margin and supply chain results and our outlook for 2023 and provide color on our capital investments. Starting with gross margin. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 50.9% was 183 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021, but in line with our guidance expectations.For the full year, gross margin came in at 51.2%, which was 145 basis point decrease from last year. Our year-over-year margin results were primarily impacted by the rollout of our professional pricing initiative, combined with anticipated comparison headwinds to the LIFO benefits that we realized in 2021. We are pleased to generate a full year gross margin rate in the upper end of our guidance range. However, we're even more excited to drive strong gross profit dollar growth. Our price investments and superior execution of our business model paid off in a solid 5% increase in gross profit dollars in 2022, which represents a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 11%. I want to thank our supply chain store operations and sales teams for their hard work in driving these results in a dynamic and very challenging market environment.For 2023, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 50.8% to 51.3%, which is consistent with how we viewed our margin guide throughout 2022. Even though we aren't anticipating a significant year-over-year change, there are a few puts and takes that I want to call out that we expect to impact our gross margin in 2023. To begin, we will face some remaining incremental pressure in the first quarter from our professional pricing initiative as we lap a higher gross margin run rate at the beginning of 2022 before we fully rolled out the initiative in the middle of the first quarter. We also will face headwinds from a number of other factors, including comparisons to temporary benefits in the first half of 2022 from the timing of selling price increases, a higher planned mix of professional business in 2023 as that side of the business continues to grow faster, the calendaring of the remaining LIFO benefit that we realized in 2022, and pressure on distribution costs as we continue to stabilize our network after the disruptive periods we have seen during the pandemic, and face headwinds in the fixed cost we capitalized in inventory driven by a significantly smaller planned inventory build in 2023.Offsetting these headwinds, our gross margin outlook also includes an anticipated benefit from modest acquisition cost improvements. On balance, we still expect to see inflationary pressure in acquisition cost in 2023, driven by rising labor and raw material costs in the supply chain. These are specific areas that we have seen some relief in from cost pressure that were passed along to us over the course of the last 2 years, specifically in freight and transportation costs. Beyond what we have built into our outlook for next year, we remain very cautious regarding the prospect for incremental reductions in acquisition costs as most of our supply chain partners continue to face broad inflationary pressures. On an individual basis, none of the discrete factors I just outlined represent a significant impact to our gross margin.And candidly, we normally don't dig in at this level of detail in discussing the puts and takes that impact our margin. However, we think it's important to provide additional color since there are so many moving pieces. Over the last several years, we have seen variability in our quarterly margin results that are not typical of the normal cadence for our business, driven by significant cost inflation, the reversal of our LIFO debit balance and the implementation of our professional pricing initiative. In 2023, we anticipate quarter-to-quarter gross margins to be more consistent, with only first quarter being slightly below our full year guidance, driven by product mix. However, since some of our comparisons are more challenging, in the first half of the year, we do expect to see some pressure on gross margin rate on a year-over-year basis in the first two quarters.Inventory per store at the end of 2022 was $730,000, which was up 15% from the end of last year, which is significantly above the target that we set for inventory growth at the beginning of 2022. Over the course of much of the last 3 years, it has been our intent to aggressively add incremental inventory dollars, and we have been constrained by supply chain challenges and the necessity to keep up with the strong sales volumes and replenishment needs of our stores. As we move through the back half of 2022, our supply chain distribution and store operations teams made tremendous progress in deploying additional inventory. We also proactively took advantage of opportunities to incrementally add inventory to our network as we saw upside in capitalizing on strong sales demand as supply constraints begin to ease.For 2023, we are planning per store inventory to increase approximately 2%, which is below our historical run rates. This is primarily because of the inventory additions that we accelerated at the end of 2022. Our ongoing inventory management is geared to deploy the right inventory at the optimal position within our tiered distribution network. While our expected incremental additions in 2023 are modest, our plans include continued adjustments to push out and pull back inventory to ensure that we're offering the best possible local inventory assortments. A key part of our inventory deployment strategy is our ongoing evaluation and modification of all aspects of our hub store network, including the number of hub stores, sizing of inventory assortments and market positioning.A substantial amount of increased inventory that we deployed in 2022 and the dollars we plan to roll out in 2023 are targeted in our hub stores to further enhance our industry-leading inventory position. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 135%, which sets an all-time high for our company, and was heavily influenced by extremely strong sales volumes and inventory turns along with the impact from increased inflation and product acquisition costs. While we deployed significant incremental inventory into our distribution centers and stores in 2022, we actually saw a decrease in net inventory investment of $513 million. We anticipate our AP to inventory ratio to moderate slightly as we move through 2023 and currently expect to finish the year with a ratio of approximately 133%.Our capital expenditures in 2022 were $563 million, which fell short of our original plan by approximately $140 million. The lower CapEx was driven by a few different factors, including a heavier weighing of leased versus owned stores, the delay of certain store DC and headquarter projects and planned maintenance, and the timing of expenditures related to distribution expansion projects. Included in our expectations for 2023, our plan to deploy capital for the initiatives that were delayed in 2022 as well as support new store and DC development to support our long-term growth strategies in the U.S. and Mexico. For 2023, we are setting our capital expenditure guidance at $750 million to $800 million. We have also established a target of 180 to 190 net new store openings with a planned heavier mix of owned versus leased locations.Our CapEx outlook also includes significant investments in our distribution network as we will complete and open our newest distribute center in Guadalajara, Mexico and expect initial expenditures for future projects. We have identified several exciting projects and initiatives in 2023 to enhance our service levels and provide customers an improved efficiency and product availability. Our CapEx guidance includes planned investments in significant DC and store fleet upgrades, store projects to enhance the image, appearance and convenience of our stores, and strategic investments in information technology projects. Before I turn the call over to Jeremy, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for their unwavering commitment to our customers and dedication to going the extra mile to deliver outstanding business results in 2022.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremy.Jeremy Fletcher: Thanks, Brent. I would also like to congratulate Team O'Reilly on another outstanding year. Now we will fill in some additional details on our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2023. For the fourth quarter, sales increased $353 million, comprised of a $288 million increase in comp store sales, a $65 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales, and a $2 million decrease from closed stores. For 2023, we expect our total revenues to be between $15.2 billion and $15.5 billion. Brent covered our gross margin performance and guidance earlier, but I want to provide a quick reminder on how we view the application of LIFO in our gross margin results. We view our reported gross margin as the best measurement of our performance.Since the GAAP cost of goods sold under the LIFO method most closely matches our current acquisition costs, as a result, we don't view the normal application of LIFO as a discrete charge in our evaluation of gross margin. In the first quarter of 2022, we did receive a limited benefit of just under $10 million, resulting from the reversal of our historic LIFO debit balance and the final sell-through of inventory purchased prior to acquisition cost increases. This comparison headwind is a component of our gross margin expectations that Brent outlined earlier. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 18.2% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 19.9%, reduced by a 1.7% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2021 rate of 19.4% of pretax income which was comprised of a base tax rate of 20.4% reduced by a 1% benefit for share-based compensation.The fourth quarter of 2022 base rate as compared to 2021 was lower as a result of an increase in certain state tax credits. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 22.4% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.3%, reduced by a 0.9% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2023, we expect an effective tax rate of 22.9%, comprised of a base rate of 23.4%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other three quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate. Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results and our expectations for 2023.Free cash flow for 2022 was $2.4 billion versus $2.5 billion in 2021. The decrease of $178 million was driven by higher capital expenditures in 2022 versus 2021, and differences in accrued compensation. For 2023, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. As Brent discussed earlier, the expected year-over-year decrease is due to a planned increase in net inventory in 2023 versus the benefit we realized in 2022 as well as the planned increase in CapEx. These headwinds are expected to be partially offset by a benefit of $300 million in 2023, resulting from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits. Moving on to debt, we finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.84x as compared to our end of 2021 ratio of 1.69x, with the increase driven by our successful issuance of $850 million of 10-year senior notes in June, offset by the September retirement of $300 million of maturing notes.We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x, and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And for 2022, based on the strength of our business, we were able to purchase 5 million shares at an average share price of $661.66 for total investment of $3.3 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2011, we have repurchased 91 million shares at an average share price of $224.8 for a total investment of $20.4 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected future discounted cash flows of our and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include additional share repurchases.Before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank our team for your hard work and dedication to our company and our customers. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Paul, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.According to Market Watch, the global orange juice industry is currently worth over $6 billion, and by 2027, is expected to grow to $7.6 billion, at a CAGR of 3.91%, which while not bad, isn't as strong as many other food industries, and we'll discuss why this is the case later. Currently, the global orange juice industry spans most countries across the world, with the sight of a jug or glass of orange juice being a breakfast staple in most nations, especially in the West. Despite this global presence, the industry is mainly dominated by a few select companies.Orange juice has a long and storied history, which can be traced back to the 16th century when it was first consumed by Spanish explorers, but it was only in the 20th century that orange juice became more publicly available in the United States and in other countries too. Frozen concentrate, one of the main types of orange juice, is where water in orange juice is evaporated, after which juice sugars and solids become concentrated. This concentrate is then frozen which allows for a much longer shelf life, while some concentrates mix frozen juice and concentrate in order to get sweeter flavors. This is why, more or less all shelf orange juice does not come close to tasting like real, freshly-squeezed orange juice and can often taste more sour or bitter as compared to freshly squeezed orange juice. Since most people have only ever tasted store-bought juice, they don't realize the difference in taste. When orange juice is deoxygenated, the taste is negatively impacted, which is why chemicals are added, which are technically made of oranges. This is why juices can claim to be 100% real orange as technically it's true.12 countries that produce the most orange juice in the worldDespite the global appeal of orange juice, only a few countries produce most of the world's orange juice. In fact, just three countries produce the vast majority of orange juice in the world, accounting for over 60% of the total orange juice production. In the United States, which is among the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world, Florida is the biggest producer of orange juice by far. Oranges are generally picked and processed within 24 hours so that freshness and quality is maintained, before being boxed and sold. However, Florida has seen its orange production fall 90% from all-time highs in the 1990s.Story continuesCurrently, the orange juice industry is facing several changes, which need to be worked on to ensure further growth. Rising concern for healthy items have resulted in many people switching from orange juice, which has sugar either added or present naturally in oranges, to energy drinks and sports drinks, which are a multibillion dollar industry which is also growing quite fast. Prices for oranges are continuing to rise as well, as the impact of climate change can be felt on the industry with erratic and severe weather patterns including hurricanes and droughts, which have led to a fall in the production of oranges. According to the US Department of Agriculture, orange juice production globally in 2022/2023 is expected to fall by 7% as the biggest producers in Mexico, the European Union, Brazil and the U.S. have seen a decrease in fruit available for processing. The forecast for the next year is of 1.6 million tonnes.Frozen concentrated orange juice futures hit record highs of $2.67 a pound according to New York's Intercontinental Exchange. Storms, crop greening, realty land grab and frost have all resulted in production falling significantly; two back-to-back hurricanes alone have devastated crop yield for oranges and citrus greening, a hard to fight plant disease, has contributed its fair share in impacting oranges growth. While this is great news for frozen-concentrate orange juice speculators, the price is a huge damper for the orange juice industry, as its supply is elastic. At the same time, sentiment is also suggesting that this is just the beginning and prices could increase much more in 2023. According to the director of agricultural research at AgriSompo North America “It can lead to a lot of volatility and we could see some downdraft. But this being orange juice, it’s not the most liquid commodity. Seeing it trade north of $3 a lb would not in any way surprise me.” Within this year alone, frozen-concentrate orange juice futures have increased by 30%.While there are several small-scale producers and processors in the orange juice industry, they often do not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to compete with the bigger players who dominate market share in this industry. While these challenges are difficult to surmount, the industry's response to these issues will determine its future. Currently, the biggest players in the orange juice industry include PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE:KDP). PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) owns several major juice brands including Tropicana and Naked Juice, though it sold 61% of its juice brand portfolio to PAI Partners in 2021, retaining 39%. Meanwhile, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which is the biggest producer of juices in the world, owns the Minute Maid brand, one of the most popular brands of orange juice in the world and the first company to market frozen orange juice concentrate. Nestle is another major player in this industry, marketing orange juices under the Nestle brand.To determine the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world, we scoured statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has data on everything related to orange juice, including production by country. We then ranked each country based on its production in 2020 and 2021, assigning 70% weightage to 2021 as it was the most recent year, and 30% weightage to 2020. So, let's now take a look at the countries which ensure that orange juice supply is maintained globally.12. GreeceTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 887Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 750Greek oranges are well-known for their flavor and in 2019, Greece exported orange juice worth $19 million.11. ItalyTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 1,773Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 1,500Italy's 2021 orange season saw prices remain low thanks to large harvested volumes and high yields, which were able to offset the impact of the Tristeza virus in Sicilian orange groves.10. SpainTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 3,496Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 3,511The largest producer of orange juice in Europe, Spain has registered a slight increase in production versus 2020, while prices have increased significantly in 2022. The reduction in volumes is partly because of inclement weather in the country.9. IsraelTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 2,800Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 4,300Israel has seen the highest growth in orange juice production among all the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.

MoroccoTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 5,000Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 5,500Morocco has seen a 10% increase in orange juice production from 2020 to 2021.7. TurkeyTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 9,500Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 10,000According to Market Research, the orange juice industry in Turkey is worth around $20.5 million. In 2022, Turkey's fruit juice exports were expected to grow by 100%, cementing its place as among the countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.6. AustraliaTotal orange juice production in 2020 (in metric tonnes): 17,400Total orange juice production in 2021 (in metric tonnes): 16,500The overall juice industry in Australia is worth $800 million and provides around 5,000 jobs. According to ABC Australia in 2020, citrus growers in the country said that the availability of orange juice in the nation would decrease because of low prices being paid to growers as the land dedicated to growing the main juicing varieties of oranges have already decreased by 30% in the last twenty years. Since citrus growers can make more money selling fresh fruit rather than for juice. Meanwhile, drinks such as kombucha and energy drinks have also increased competition against the orange juice industry.Click to continue reading the 5 countries that produce the most orange juice in the world.Suggested articles:17 Most Valuable E-commerce Companies in the World21 Largest Italian Companies by Market CapTop 20 Oil Importing Countries in 2023Disclosure: None. 12 countries that produce the most orange juice in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The stock market bloodbath that started in 2022 has forced investors to shun the so-called growth companies that have nothing to show in terms of cash or tangible short-term value. That’s because investors tend to flee risky assets towards safe, value plays that can offer them safety and a refuge from volatility during difficult times. Value underperformed growth from 2007 until 2020. But the era of growth dominance seems to have ended. In a report titled Value vs. Growth Investing: Value returns with a Vengeance, JPMorgan analysts said that from 2007 through 2020 value underperformed in all sectors and asset classes. This underperformance reached its peak in 2020. The report said that as the world moved online after the pandemic, innovation and growth saw a lot of traction. The report highlights that this was the time when the markets made the same mistake as they did during the “TMT bubble” by “boosting future normalized growth rates”.The JPMorgan report says that by the end of 2020, “expectations became divorced from reality” as many software and growth companies’ valuations touched unprecedented highs.The report mentioned Tesla, Facebook and other growth companies as examples of huge valuations that were not connected with reality.""Amazon and Microsoft are undoubtedly great companies, but if you had bought them at the height of the TMT bubble in December 1999, it would have taken 10 years and 15 years, respectively, to break even. Valuation – no matter how good the company is – matters, even in the long term.""JPMorgan analysts believe value has been out of fashion for so long that many investors today aren’t used to a value-led market and they are only accustomed to small market rallies that last ""only six to nine months.”Story continues“All of this indicates that we are in for a reckoning that has only just begun.”Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the Dow 30 group of companies and picked the stocks that have a PE ratio of under 20 as of February 10.

CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)7.
