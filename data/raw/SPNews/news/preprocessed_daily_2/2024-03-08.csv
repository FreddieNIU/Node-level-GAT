Low rates are generally favorable for growth stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets. Growth stocks, with their potential for high returns, become more appealing to investors in this environment, driving up demand and, consequently, their prices.Growth investing is likely to shine this year. Investors seeking to benefit from the trend should invest in growth ETFs like Vanguard Growth ETF VUG, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF, iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF IVW, Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF SCHG and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK. These are the most popular options in the large-cap space and have a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting outperformance in the months ahead (read: 5 Top-Ranked ETFs at New Highs Set to Soar Further).Powell noted that inflation had “eased substantially” since hitting a 40-year high in 2022 but that policymakers still needed “greater confidence” in its continued decline before cutting rates. He added that there are risks of keeping monetary policy tight for too long and damaging an ongoing economic expansion that has sustained a below 4% unemployment rate for two years.The latest bouts of weak data have raised the bets that the Fed might lower interest rates as soon as June. The U.S. manufacturing sector recorded its 16th consecutive month of decline in February, while Michigan University’s consumer confidence index dropped slightly last month. U.S. personal spending data also showed the weakest reading in three years. Traders now see a 72.7% chance of the first rate cut this year in June, per CME Group's FedWatch tool (read: Is US Manufacturing Space Improving? 4 Sector ETFs Look Decent).Additionally, the U.S. stock market has been on a surge this year, hitting new all-time highs fueled by strong corporate earnings, AI developments and renewed confidence in the tech sector. Growth funds generally tend to outperform during an uptrend.Growth investing focuses on capital appreciation rather than annual income or dividends. It is a stock-buying strategy that aims to profit from companies that grow at above-average rates compared to their industry or the market. This is a more active attempt versus the value to build up the portfolio and generate more return on the capital investment. However, these funds offer exposure to stocks with growth characteristics that have comparatively higher P/B, P/S and P/E ratios and exhibit a higher degree of volatility, especially compared to value stocks.Let’s discuss the abovementioned ETFs in detail below:\xa0\xa0 \xa0Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)Vanguard Growth ETF offers exposure to the growth segment of large-cap equities and follows the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index. It holds 208 stocks in its basket, with a higher concentration on the top two firms. Technology dominates the fund’s portfolio at 55.8%, while consumer discretionary and industrials round off the next two sectors with 19.6% and 8.7% share, respectively.Vanguard Growth ETF has AUM of $117.6 billion and an average daily volume of 1 million shares. It charges 4 bps in fees per year.iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF)iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF provides exposure to large and mid-capitalization U.S. equities that exhibit growth characteristics by tracking the Russell 1000 Growth Index. iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF holds 443 securities in its basket with a tilt toward the information technology sector, while consumer discretionary, communication and healthcare receive double-digit exposure each.With AUM of $88.4 million, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF trades in heavy volume of around 1.4 million shares a day on average and charges 19 bps in annual fees.iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW)iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF tracks the S&P 500 Growth Index and holds 225 stocks in its basket. It is heavily concentrated on the top two firms, with double-digit exposure. The ETF is skewed toward information technology at 47.6%, while consumer discretionary and communication round off the next two spots with a double-digit exposure each (read: Here's Why Growth ETFs are Scaling New Highs).iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF charges 18 bps in annual fees and has amassed $39 billion in its asset base. The fund trades in an average daily volume of 2.6 million shares.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG)With AUM of $26.3 billion, Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index. It holds 251 stocks in its basket, with a large concentration on the top two firms.

Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.

By and large, most things you can buy from one, you can also buy from the other. Target's (NYSE: TGT) recently reported fourth-quarter numbers, however, are a reminder of why Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is the better investment of the two options right now."", 'The market overwhelmingly disagrees with my argument, by the way. Target shares soared to the tune of 12% on Tuesday following the release of its Q4 results.', 'The company handily topped earnings estimates of $2.42 per share by posting a profit of $2.98, well up from the year-ago comparison of $1.89 per share. Margins were better too. Target also unveiled several new growth initiatives, including a subscription-based same-day delivery program. Guidance for the fiscal year that began in February is in line with estimates as well.', 'Now take a closer look at the numbers. Although ""comparable sales and traffic trends improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row,"" they only improved by virtue of being less bad. Same-store sales still slipped 5.4% during the three-month stretch ending in January, and that was with an extra week\'s worth of selling! Total revenue of $31.9 billion was only up 1.7% year over year, with new stores driving more than all of that net growth.', ""The biggest piece of Target's net income growth of $506 million came from a $543 million reduction in the costs of goods sold -- a benefit that the retailer didn't necessarily create itself. Its selling and administrative costs grew 6.3% from $5.6 billion to $6 billion, outpacing sales growth by a country mile."", ""It's not all bad, to be fair. The company's biggest headache from just a few quarters ago -- way too much inventory -- no longer appears to be a costly problem. Inventory levels fell from $13.5 billion a year ago to only $11.9 billion as of the beginning of February, not forcing Target to take the profit-pinching markdowns it suffered for much of 2023. It's also anticipating measurable comparable sales growth in 2024."", ""None of these numbers, however, hold a candle to Walmart's. Its company-wide revenue improved 5.7% (4.9% on a constant currency basis) during its comparable holiday quarter. Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 4%. Gross profits grew from 22.9% of sales to 23.3% of sales during the three-month stretch ended in January, while adjusted per-share profits moved from $1.71 in the last fiscal quarter of 2022 to $1.80 per share this time around."", ""In some ways, these results are better than Target's. In other ways, they're worse. The ways in which they're worse, however, tend to be the more important ones for retailers. Take sales as an example. If nothing else, selling the goods currently sitting on store shelves frees up room and money to buy more marketable goods, even if margins on the merchandise going out the door right now aren't particularly high."", ""At the very least, Walmart is getting inventory from its warehouses onto its stores' shelves and then into customers' hands. It may not be making a whole lot more, but in the world of retailing, every penny is important."", ""The company isn't spending a ton more money to do it, either. Although Walmart's selling and administrative expenses did edge higher during the quarter ending in January, that 3.8% increase is measurably less than the 5.7% increase in its top line. Those figures are reflective of the full-year numbers too."", ""The kicker: Walmart is expecting top-line growth of between 3% and 4% this year, roughly doubling Target's own outlook."", ""Why is Target struggling to do what Walmart seems to be able to do with ease? There are a couple of arguable reasons. The first of these is consumers' perception of Target. The two retailers certainly have their similarities. They're not the same, though. Target has successfully branded itself as a place for people to spend their discretionary dollars."", ""By contrast, Walmart remains a place to find value. Since lingering inflation and economic uncertainty are weighing on people's minds right now, more of them are opting to visit a Walmart. Indeed, Walmart has consistently highlighted the fact that most of last year's market share gains came from households with annual incomes of more than $100,000. That used to be Target's bread and butter."", ""The other reason Walmart is winning while Target isn't? Size. Walmart's just got more of it -- and it's using it. With over 5,000 stores in the U.S. alone versus Target's less than 2,000 (not to mention that Walmart is also the U.S.'s biggest grocery store chain), Walmart enjoys considerably more leverage that it's not afraid to apply."", 'Early last year, for instance, Walmart flatly told several of its packaged-food suppliers it would no longer digest price increases, threatening to more prominently feature its own private-label goods without price relief. Then it used its size and in-house know-how to help these brands lower their wholesale costs.', ""It's also worth asking whether Target overreacted to last year's inventory growth debacle, culling so much of it between then and now that it doesn't have enough of the right merchandise on its shelves. Never say never."", ""This divergence between these two similar companies won't be this pronounced forever. The economy will eventually find itself on a firmer footing, favoring Target's discretionary schtick. Walmart will eventually slip as well, perhaps becoming a victim of its own size and complexity."", ""Such a shift isn't on the near-term radar, however. Inflation rates are still above the Federal Reserve's target levels, and the Fed is seemingly losing interest in previously expected interest rate cuts toward the middle of this year. In the meantime, job layoffs are accelerating again, while credit card debt among U.S. residents stood at a record high of $1.13 trillion as of the end of 2023, according to numbers from the Federal Reserve. The yield curve remains inverted as well."", ""These aren't the sorts of challenges that simply fade away in a matter of weeks. It could take months -- if not years -- to shrug them off. People will be thinking, acting, and spending cautiously until that happens. Walmart stock remains the better bet in the meantime."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

The list is now the benchmark for companies around the world and a consistent metric with which to assess the country’s economic health.', 'With the release of the 2024 Fortune 500 right around the corner, here are the basics on Fortune’s flagship list.', 'Simply put, the Fortune 500 is a list of the largest 500 U.S. companies, public and private, ranked based on revenue.', 'Investors use the list to track the rise and fall of American companies and make conclusions about the country’s economic health, and companies use it as a way to assess its growth and competitive edge from year to year. For academics, industry professionals, and business leaders, the Fortune 500 is a way to learn which businesses and industries are rising.', 'Not all companies are eligible for the Fortune 500. Those eligible include incorporated and operated in the U.S. which file financial statements with a government agency, such as publicly listed companies, and private companies that file with a government agency. Companies incorporated outside the U.S. are not eligible for the list, nor are private companies that don’t file through government agencies.', 'For companies meeting this criteria, there’s a challenge to be eligible for the list. Every year, Fortune sets a revenue threshold for companies to meet to be considered for the list. In 2022, all listees had to have made at least $7.24 billion in revenue.', 'The Fortune 500 will be released online on June 4, 2024. You can find the 2023 list here.', 'Fortune’s Assistant Managing Editor Edgar P. Smith launched the list in 1955, when Fortune was under Time’s umbrella. It had an early moniker of the “Annual Directory of the 500 Largest Corporations.”', 'In the mid-1950s, the U.S. economy was booming, but after decades of economic strife—including the Great Depression and the economic fallout of two world wars—companies were slow to show any optimism, a Fortune story from 1995 recalled.', 'Despite the explosion of thriving businesses, the success of these companies were poorly documented, Loomis wrote. Fortune began compiling a list of the largest U.S. companies for its internal use, but Smith had another idea: “I think that our readers just might be interested in this list,"" he said.', 'Compiling the list was a slog for Fortune’s staff. After it was released to the public, the attitude towards the Fortune 500 shifted. It was a “box-office smash, no question.” The list became the touchstone for tracking U.S. businesses and their rippling impact.', '“In its entirety, the 500 has been a wide window on the U.S. economy and a reference point for all,” the Fortune story said. “It has been cited by Presidents and Congressmen, dissected by economists, and viewed by business leaders—still yearning for normality and never quite finding it—as the Bunyanesque yardstick of industrial progress.”', 'In 1955, General Motors topped the Fortune 500, reporting over $9.8 billion in revenue and $806 million in profits. It’s stayed on the list every year since— last year, it sat at No. 21. Other companies in the original top 10 include U.S. Steel, General Electric, Chrysler, Armour, Gulf Oil, Mobil and DuPont.', 'Companies such as GM and Mobil—which merged with Exxon in 1999 and ranks No. 3 on 2023’s list—have held their ground on the list for decades. Over 1,800 companies have been listees over the Fortune 500’s 70 years.', 'Today, e-commerce and retail giants top the Fortune 500, with Walmart holding the top spot, where it’s been for 11 years. Amazon had been Walmart’s runner-up four years in a row.', 'In 1995, Walmart—first opened in 1962—was the rookie with the highest ranking on the 500, coming in at No. 4.', 'Today’s Fortune 500 companies are also making more than the $9.8 billion GM reported in 1955. GM made nearly $172 billion in revenue in 2023, and Walmart reported $611 billion in 2023 revenue.', 'In 2023, the Fortune 500 companies had their highest ever combined revenue of $18.1 trillion, with the top 10 firms earning over $3.7 trillion, or about 20% of the list’s total revenue.', 'A cadre of fewer than 50 companies have graced the list every year since the beginning. Besides GM and ExxonMobil, they include pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer and Merck, as well as familiar food and drink brands like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills.', 'On the other end of the spectrum, the Fortune 500 saw some fresh faces, including Airbnb and Lululemon. In total, the 15 new companies joining the list made $146.2 billion in revenue and had an average growth rate of over 50%.', 'Skechers, ServiceNow, EQT, and Coupang were among the list’s other newbies.', 'For the first twenty years of the list’s existence, the CEOs representing the Fortune 500 companies were demographically homogeneous. That began to change in 1972, when\xa0Katharine Graham became CEO of the Washington Post, and subsequently the first woman CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Fifteen years later, Clifton Wharton became the first Black CEO of a Fortune 500 company after taking over at TIAA. Former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns became the first Black woman to helm a Fortune 500 company in 2009.', 'Last year marked the first time that women made up over 10% of CEOs of the country’s most powerful companies, with 52 companies of the 500 run by women.', 'While the Fortune 500 had its near-record high percentage of Black CEOs last year, making up eight of the list’s 500 companies, that’s still only 1.6% of the listees.', 'Executives agree that there’s not a quick fix to building diversity among the highest ranks of these companies, with few people of color in management tracks.', '“The tracks that lead to the CEO jobs are primarily P&Ls,” Michael Hyter, chief diversity officer at consulting firm Korn Ferry, said in 2021. “There are a lot of people of color in support roles [accounting, marketing]—lots.

The company's decision to do a 3-for-1 split was motivated in part by a desire to ensure shares remained affordable for employees, also known as associates."", 'Referencing founder Sam Walton in explaining the stock split decision, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said, ""Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates.""', ""Walmart shares reached an all-time high of $181.35 on Feb. 20. Since then, the company's share price remains near its split-adjusted 52-week high of $60.45, raising the question of whether it's a buy."", ""To decide if it makes sense to pick up Walmart shares, let's examine the company beyond its stock-split action, as a long-term investment."", ""Walmart's business is doing well. It wrapped up its 2024 fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, with fourth-quarter revenue of $173.4 billion, a 6% increase from the prior year. Its full-year sales of $648.1 billion was also a 6% year-over-year jump."", ""The company expects its revenue growth to continue in fiscal 2025, forecasting at least a 3% increase in net sales over the prior year. Walmart's fiscal 2024 net sales, which excludes some income such as its Sam's Club membership fees, totaled $642.6 billion."", ""The anticipated rise in revenue this fiscal year may mean a potential increase for Walmart's stock as well. The company's share price has been in lockstep with its sales growth over the past several years as both headed steadily upward."", 'Adding to this are estimates by Wall Street analysts that Walmart will reach a median share price of $65, indicating a belief in upside for the stock.', ""Walmart's ability to grow revenue over time is thanks to its diversified income streams. The company has expanded beyond store sales and is finding success in these efforts."", ""Walmart's e-commerce revenue rose 23% year over year in Q4 and crossed $100 billion for the year. Its advertising business is thriving with 33% year-over-year sales growth in Q4 and hitting $3.4 billion for fiscal 2024, a nearly 30% year-over-year increase."", ""In addition to revenue growth, Walmart's free cash flow (FCF) also grew, rising by $3.1 billion from fiscal 2023 to reach $15.1 billion. FCF provides insight into Walmart's cash available to invest in its business, pay debt obligations, repurchase shares, and fund dividends. Walmart's healthy FCF growth enabled it to raise its dividend for the 51st consecutive year, as well as increase it by the largest amount in over a decade."", 'The company is also well-positioned to invest in its business, and as part of that, it\'s acquiring television maker Vizio for approximately $2.3 billion.

Moreover, its advertising income accounted for the majority of Vizio's sales growth over the past five years, according to Walmart."", ""There's a lot to like about Walmart's business right now.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Erik."", ""Erik Nordstrom: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll start with our fourth quarter performance and discuss our 2023 priorities and cover what we're focused on for 2024. We delivered a strong fourth quarter with net sales of $4.3 billion and earnings per share of $0.96. For the full year, our results were within or better than the guidance we laid out, and we accomplished what we set out to do: enhance the customer experience and drive better financial performance. Ahead of the holiday shopping season, our teams worked hard to deliver the right assortment as well as providing engaging experiences for our customers. As a result of these efforts, we achieved sequential improvement in net sales, profitability, number of customers and purchase trips in the fourth quarter."", ""Throughout 2023, we remain focused on three priorities intended to drive better financial performance while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our first priority was to improve Nordstrom Rack performance. One way that we did that was by opening 19 new stores in 2023. New Rack stores continue to be an excellent investment as they deliver well in excess of their cost of capital with a relatively short payback period. However, it's not just the new stores that drove the Rack's impressive net sales growth in the fourth quarter as Rack comparable store sales also grew by high single digits. Our Rack digital business also improved in traffic and conversion in the fourth quarter, enabling sales, which contributed to NordstromRack.com's full year profitability."", 'From a merchandise standpoint, we focused our efforts to improve our offering at the Rack as we know that delivering great brands at great prices is what our customers want. Our second priority in 2023 was to increase inventory productivity. We continue to focus on managing inventory effectively as evidenced by the positive sales to inventory spread in the fourth quarter, which sets us up well from a merchandise standpoint as we start the new fiscal year. Additionally, our efforts to reduce the overhang of designer inventory met our target, and our overall newness of inventory is stronger than it was a year ago, given fewer aged items to clear through. Our third priority of 2023 was to optimize our supply chain capabilities, a continuation of efforts that began in 2022.', 'In Q4, for the sixth consecutive quarter, the team delivered another 50-plus basis points of improvement in variable supply chain expense savings, while at the same time, improving our click to delivery speed. Building on the momentum of our efforts to optimize our supply chain, we have made the strategic decision to relocate operations from our fulfillment center in San Bernardino in California, to our West Coast omnichannel center just 25 miles away in Riverside. WCOC has been scaling for several years now and is well positioned to serve our customers across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners following the investments we have made to enhance capabilities at the facility. It is our newest, most automated facility, offering a substantially lower processing cost per unit.', ""We record a $32 million asset impairment and related charge due to this relocation. We're pleased with the results of our efforts against our three priorities for 2023 as not only did they drive better financial outcomes for the Company, but also supported our efforts to improve the customer experience. Next, I'd like to take a moment to discuss merchandise performance in the fourth quarter as Pete is away in market and unable to join us today. We came into Q4 at a much healthier inventory position than in the prior year, resulting in fewer markdowns during the quarter, which helped to drive an expansion of our gross profit margin by 125 basis points. Active, Beauty and Women's Apparel were our best-performing categories in the fourth quarter, with strong growth versus the prior year."", ""The Active category was led by Shoes, with strength from brands like On Running and Hoka as well as apparel brand, Vuori. We leaned into Beauty with a strong gift selection for holiday as well as a 5x point promotion for our Nordy Club members. This offer drove incremental trips and conversion while creating a halo effect in other categories. Fragrance was the top performer in beauty at both banners, highlighted by brands such as Burberry, YSL and Marc Jacobs. At the Nordstrom banner, designer makeup drove strong growth from Chanel, Tom Ford and Dior, while the skin care category improved compared with the previous year. At the Rack, the rollout of an expanded offering of hair care products supported our outsized growth. The improvement in Women's Apparel was supported by seasonally relevant newness in addition to our turnaround with the young customer, which is an area we have a multiyear plan to improve."", ""We are pleased with the progress in this area in Q4, which was led by our Nordstrom private brands. At the Nordstrom banner, dressier categories were the best performing. Brands such as Vince, Veronica Beard, and Cinq à Sept delivered solid growth. Overall, we exited 2023 with improved inventory levels versus the prior year, which provides us the opportunity to have a consistent flow of relevant product as we move towards spring. Turning to 2024. We're confident in our plan for the year. Building upon the work we did in 2023, we've refreshed our three key priorities for 2024: driving Nordstrom banner growth, optimizing operationally, and building on momentum at the Rack. The first priority is to drive growth at our Nordstrom banner. Our customers value the relevance and inspiration that we offer."", ""We aim to provide that by offering a compelling product mix along with creating an environment where they not only shop their favorite brands and products but also discover new ones. We will focus our Nordstrom banner efforts on digital-led growth supported by our stores. One thing we're excited about is the launch of our digital markets on nordstrom.com starting in April. By reimagining the way we work with our brand partners, we'll grow our curated online assortment to serve more customers on even more occasions through increasing our use of unowned inventory. Marketplace will allow customers to shop more products and sizes from their favorite brands while providing them more access to new and emerging brands. As we do this, we're also creating a more personalized digital experience that makes it easy for our customers to navigate our growing assortment."", ""Expanding our assortment through unowned inventory has the potential to drive GMV growth in addition to providing compelling economics. We'll also drive Nordstrom growth by amplifying the brands that matter most to our customers, along with ensuring we have the depth in these brands consistently across our stores and online. Beauty will also continue to play a prominent role in our assortment and growth. Our efforts are designed to create more engagement in addition to improving retention while serving customers on more occasions with the breadth of assortment that they expect from us. Our second priority for 2024, operational optimization, builds upon the success that we've had in optimizing our supply chain capabilities. This entails a focus on driving faster fulfillment and delivery for our customers as well as maximizing our inventory value through its life cycle."", ""We will continue our efforts to improve inventory integrity and optimize inventory positioning along with increasing the speed of product to the customer. We are making investments in systems and technology enablers to standardize and streamline our inventory processes, expanding the scale of our RFID utilization and improving the inventory movement within our business, all with the end goal of enhancing the customer experience and improving our cost position. Our third priority for 2024 is building on the momentum at the Rack. Opening new Rack stores is a profitable investment as well as a key way to reach more new customers and drive Rack banner growth. As we're opening more new stores, we're finding our performance and efficiency continues to improve."", 'Expanding our network of stores brings our omnichannel services closer to the customer, giving them more reasons and opportunities to engage with us. We consistently hear how customers enjoy the convenience of shopping between our banners, taking advantage of the services we offer, including cross-banner in-store returns, buy online, pick up in-store and alterations. In 2023, we opened 19 new stores, and our intent is to open 22 new stores in 2024. Rack stores continue to be a growth engine for our company as they are our largest source of new customer acquisition, accounting for over 40%. Growing our store count also supports long-term customer retention. In fact, roughly a quarter of retained Rack customers migrate to the Nordstrom banner within four years.', ""We aim to deliver top line Rack growth led by stores and supported by enhanced digital capabilities in 2024. To that end, in addition to growing the number of Rack stores, we also intend to continue the profitable momentum at nordstromrack.com. By leveraging our digital assets, our suite of omnichannel offerings will enable us to grow our selection online as well as enhance the customer experience as we strive to deliver great brands at great prices for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop. Before I turn it over to Cathy for a review on the financials, I want to thank our teams for their focus on exceptional service to our customers and execution of the day-to-day business while remaining steadfast on our priorities. We're proud of the efforts that we undertook in 2023 as well as the outcomes that enhance the customer experience and drove improved financial results."", ""Through a clear set of priorities, we're confident that we'll end 2024 as an even stronger company. And with that, I'll hand it over to Cathy."", ""Cathy Smith: Thanks, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. Although it was mentioned in the forward-looking statement at the beginning of this call, when I speak to our results and outlook, it will be on an adjusted basis for EBIT, EBIT margin and EPS, for which the relevant reconciliations can be found at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our website. I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter results, then provide some additional commentary about our transition from retail to cost accounting, discuss our outlook for 2024 and quarterly timing and close with our capital allocation priorities. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.96 compared with $0.74 in the year ago quarter."", 'We were pleased with the financial results and momentum throughout the year and that we delivered on our guidance. In Q4, we finished with year-over-year increases in gross margin, EBIT and EPS, despite net sales that were essentially flat on a like-for-like basis. Net sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter, which includes a benefit of 460 basis points related to the 53rd week and 250 basis points unfavorable impact from the wind down of Canadian operations. Total GMV increased 2% in the fourth quarter. Nordstrom banner net sales decreased 3%, including a 410 basis point benefit related to the 53rd week and a 355 basis point negative impact from the wind down of Canadian operations. Nordstrom banner GMV decreased 3% in the fourth quarter.', 'Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 15%, including a benefit of 580 basis points related to the 53rd week. Throughout the year, we saw steady progress quarter-over-quarter in the top line as we focused on this growth driver. Although digital sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2% compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, we saw quarter-over-quarter sales improvement. Digital sales represented 38% of total sales during the quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 34.4% increased 125 basis points compared with the same period last year due to lower markdowns, lower buying and occupancy costs and leverage on higher sales. Ending inventory decreased 3% in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress on inventory productivity we delivered this year.', 'As Erik mentioned, we exited the year with improved inventory levels versus last year, which set us up well to start the new fiscal year. Reported SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 85 basis points in the fourth quarter, including a $32 million supply chain asset impairment and related charge. Excluding the charge, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were in line with the year ago quarter as the impact of higher labor costs was offset by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiencies and leverage on higher sales. Our supply chain initiatives continue to deliver strong results over the last year. Our EBIT margin for the fourth quarter was 5.7% versus 4.5% in the year ago quarter, and we ended the fourth quarter with $1.4 billion in available liquidity, including over $600 million in cash.', ""Our balance sheet and financial position remain solid. Next, I want to take a moment to speak about our fiscal 2024 conversion from the retail method of accounting for inventory to the cost method. This shift to operating in units and cost lays the foundation for us to deliver on our business priorities more effectively. We will see profitability at the item level, guiding us in executing with intention and speed. We anticipate that utilizing cost accounting for financial reporting purposes in 2024 will result in a slight headwind in our 2024 results. More on that in a moment. Turning to our outlook for the year, I'll start by discussing the current environment and related assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect 2024 to be a year of continued momentum toward the long-term strength and durability of our business."", ""We continue to see a cautious consumer that is mindful of discretionary purchases in light of inflation, higher interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments. Regardless of the external environment, we will remain focused and expect to make progress on the three 2024 priorities that Erik discussed, following the solid execution against our 2023 priorities. In 2024, we expect full year revenue in the range of a decline of 2% to an increase of 1%, which includes a headwind of approximately 135 basis points from the 53rd week in 2023's results. We expect revenue to follow a typical quarterly cadence. In 2023, our credit card revenue represented slightly over 3% of net sales. We anticipate credit card revenues should be closer to 3% of net sales in 2024."", 'Now that we are consistently opening new Rack stores, we will be providing comparable sales data on a quarterly basis beginning in Q1. As such, we expect total company comparable sales in a range of a decrease of 1% to an increase of 2% in 2024 versus 52 weeks in 2023. Turning to profitability. We expect EBIT margin in the range of 3.5% to 4%, with EBIT reflecting slight pressure due to the aforementioned conversion from retail to cost accounting and modest increases in SG&A to support Rack growth. We expect a 2-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate relative to 2023 to be backed at our typical rate of 27%. From an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate full year results in the range of $1.65 to $2.05, again, weighed upon modestly by the accounting method change as well as the anticipated increase in our effective tax rate relative to 2023.', ""Although we don't typically focus our guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I would like to offer a few comments on our expectations for the cadence of the year. The estimated timing of markdown recognition under the retail method versus the cost method is anticipated to weigh heavier on the first half results, primarily in Q1. Under the retail method of accounting, last year's Q1 benefited modestly to the timing of markdown recognition in Q4 2022. However, under the cost method, we do not anticipate that to repeat. We expect this Q1's results to be near breakeven to a slight loss and Q2 to have about one-third of the year's earnings. As the year progresses, with our anniversary sale almost entirely in the second quarter as one week shifts back out of Q3, the rest of the year should follow a more traditional cadence as the estimated headwind from the change in accounting method lessens throughout the year."", 'Turning to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same. The first is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5x. We have a bond maturity of $250 million in April that we intend to retire using cash on hand. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. In closing, we made great progress against our priorities and delivered on our guidance for the year in 2023.', ""I'm looking forward to the progress that we'll make this year and getting after the growth opportunities we have, both at Nordstrom banner and the Rack. As I mentioned earlier, we expect 2024 to be a year of continued momentum toward the long-term strength and durability of our business. We thank you for your interest in Nordstrom. And with that, Jamie, we are ready for questions."", ""James Duies: Thank you, Cathy.

Further, high interest rates and interest-earning asset growth are expected to boost net interest income (NII). Strong liquidity is another positive. However, rising costs and declining mortgage banking income remain concerns.Huntington Bancshares aims to acquire the industry’s best deposit franchise. Its total deposits witnessed a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4% (2019-2023). Concurrently, total loans saw a 12.8% CAGR on the back of robust performance in commercial and consumer portfolios. Management expects loan and deposit growth to be in the range of 3-5% and 2-4% in 2024, respectively.Though Huntington Bancshares’ NII witnessed a drag in 2020 attributed to low interest rates, the metric recorded a four-year CAGR of 14.1% (ended 2023) as the Federal Reserve raised rates. Yet, increase in deposit costs weighed on it. Likewise, net interest margin (NIM) witnessed a downward trajectory in 2020 and 2021, with a subsequent recovery to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 at 3.25%. The metric gain declined in 2023 due to elevated funding costs.\xa0Despite the central bank signaling rate cuts in 2024, rates are likely to remain at decent levels. Hence, HBAN’s NII and yield on interest-bearing assets are expected to grow modestly. Management expects to maintain modest asset sensitivity through down-rate protective hedging programs to support NIM and NII growth in a rate-cut scenario in 2024 while still maintaining an exposure to get the benefits of high interest rates.Huntington Bancshares’ liquidity remains its strength. As of Dec 31, 2023, its cash and due from banks, including interest-bearing deposits, aggregated to $10.32 billion. Core deposits remain the primary source of liquidity, comprising 96% of total deposits at $151.2 billion as of the end of 2023. Total debt (comprising long-term debt and short-term borrowings) was $13 billion over the same period. HBAN has senior unsecured notes ratings of BBB+, Baa1 and A from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively. Hence, given the robust liquidity and credit strength, debt market accessibility seems feasible at lower rates, and makes the company likely to meet its debt obligations moving forward.In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 26.8% compared with the industry's 20.7% rise."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, an elevated expense base remains a challenge for the company. Non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 13.9% over the last four years (ended 2023). HBAN expects to enhance efficiency through the consolidation of 34 branch locations by the first quarter of 2024. Nonetheless, long-term investments to boost growth prospects are likely to keep the expense base high, impeding bottom-line growth. Management projects expenses to grow 4.5% this year.Huntington Bancshares’ mortgage banking business remains a challenge. High mortgage rates led to a subdued demand for such loans and refinancing activities, affecting mortgage origination volume. Mortgage banking income witnessed a 24.3% year-over-year decline in 2023. Given the high rate environment, origination volumes and refinancing activities are expected to witness a similar trend in the near term.

The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, to which Norwegian Cruise Line belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Norwegian Cruise Line is expected to post a loss of $0.16 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.7%.

Banks have pushed back on the rules saying they are too costly and would have an economic impact. Joining us now to talk about all this, Chris Whalen, Whalen Global Advisors Chairman.', 'Chris, it is always good to see you. So this did, you know, got some attention, Chris, here. Powell saying that, yes, central bank would be maybe making some meaningful changes here, Chris. What did you-- what did you make of that? And what changes would you expect?', ""CHRIS WHELAN: Well, the entire mortgage complex pushed back pretty hard on Basel. And I think even Powell said that he was a little bit taken aback by the level of opposition from a broad range of constituencies. It wasn't just the banking industry. You had the mortgage bankers, the realtors, the homebuilders, really the whole community."", ""So I think that is going to probably force him to repropose the entire [INAUDIBLE]. I expect them to be nicer to mortgages. But there are some themes that aren't going to change. I think they're very concerned about structured finance. They want to increase capital cover for those sorts of transactions, especially banks buying them for portfolio. And I do think they are going to try and tweak some of the other areas, market risk, obviously, Silicon Valley Bank."", ""But basically, Basel is a very old construct that was focused on credit risk originally if you go back to the beginnings. And over time they tried to expand it to cover other types of risk. And I think the industry and many others said, look, you're double counting. You're covering this and you're covering that, and you're really doing the same thing twice. So I'm hoping they're going to try and rationalize this a little bit and make it simpler, because it's a modeler for banks. Simple is better. If I want to understand a bank, I want the relationships I look at to be as clear and as simple as possible."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Chris, you may have seen, there was one person today who was not happy about the comments that Jay Powell was making. And that was Elizabeth Warren. I want to play for you what she had to say.', 'CHRIS WHELAN: Oh, good.', ""ELIZABETH WARREN: You are the leader of the Fed. And when the heat was on last year, you talked a lot about getting tougher on the banks. But now the giant banks are unhappy about that. And you've gone weak-kneed on this. The American people need a leader at the Fed who has the courage to stand up to these banks and protect our financial system."", ""JULIE HYMAN: That was a great soundbite, wasn't it, Chris? You've gone weak-kneed on this, says Elizabeth Warren. I mean, it does feel like a victory for the banking lobby certainly if they're pulling back on this. But you seemed to indicate that it didn't necessarily make sense in the first place."", ""CHRIS WHELAN: No. The whole construct of Basel is kind of old. We need to rebalance it. I'll give you an example, Julie. I have a model that my partner, Dennis Santiago, and I built 20 years ago that the SEC still uses. And we're going to propose to them that we rebuild it, because, periodically, you have to go look at these things. Things change. The economy changes."", ""I think Elizabeth Warren's comments are just dramatic. She doesn't really understand banking. She pretends to. And a lot of the things she says she knows are wrong. But she says them anyway, because it plays to her constituency and the progressive movement."", ""Banks have been turned into commodities, they're utilities now. And the only reason our economy is still functions as well as it does is because we have a private bond market, we have private non-bank financial companies. And that's where the innovation is."", ""Look at JPMorgan, it's only half bank. The other half is Wall Street. So if you're looking for economic growth, job creation, that sort of thing from banks, no. And remember, Elizabeth wanted us to drop interest rates to boost homeownership, just the opposite will happen now, because there's such a tight market for homes. If you drop interest rates today, home prices would soar. You would see home prices for the bottom half of homes go up double digits next year. So don't do that, you know."", ""It's been great for credit. There's been no defaults in residential mortgages for years. But we have to realize that there's a lot of inflation in the system. And it's going to be very hard to deal with that. And it's sad because people need homes. They need a place to live.""]"

The news was reported by Reuters, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.The job cuts started in December 2023. These have impacted almost 15 of Morgan Stanley Investment Management China’s employees to date.This is the first time that MS has reduced headcount in its China fund unit since buying out its local partner’s 36% stake for $54 million in 2023 and rebranding the unit as a wholly-owned subsidiary in June.According to company disclosures, Morgan Stanley Investment Management China’s assets under management have declined every quarter after reaching a peak in June 2021, resulting in a 53% decline by 2023 end.Based on the earnings results of its ex-joint venture partner Huaxin Securities, the unit recorded an operating loss of 48.5 million yuan in 2022 and 23.2 million yuan in the first half of 2023.In order to drive the unit, Morgan Stanley hired a chief investment officer, Alex Zhou, at the China unit for the first time.The staff reductions and the hiring of Zhou are part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management China’s efforts to modify and revise the business after taking full ownership.Notably, China’s prolonged economic sickness has resulted in a collapse of its stock markets, which has diminished prospects for its $3.8-trillion fund sector.Last month, the benchmark CSI 300 index, which replicates the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, fell to five-year lows after sinking 11% in 2023. The China stock markets have been hit by the unparalleled debt crisis in the property sector and a lack of large-scale government stimulus.Two decades after betting on China as the world’s biggest growth story, investors are pulling back billions of dollars from China’s actively managed equities funds.Recently, the sentiment in the nation’s stock market has improved a bit after Beijing took measures to support the market and address the underlying economic issues. It has sought to put a floor under the share prices by pushing state-controlled funds to buy stocks, curbing short-selling and trading misbehaviors.While the stimulus might result in some growth in the economy, a full stock market recovery requires a more forceful response to the property crisis.', 'Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that MS planned to lay off hundreds of workers from its wealth management (WM) division, a move that is expected to impact less than 1% of the unit’s employees.The move came as the investment banking giant, like several other Wall Street firms, seeks to reduce costs amid economic uncertainty and concerns regarding the trajectory of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Morgan Stanley has been focusing more on its WM segment and less on the institutional securities segment (constituting trading and investment banking) over the past few years. This is because the WM segment is less dependent on the capital markets and is a less volatile revenue source.The WM segment became an important profit-making unit for MS post the acquisitions of Eaton Vance and E*Trade Financial under former CEO James Gorman.However, last year, the segment’s revenues were flat year over year.The job cuts will be one of the first major moves by Morgan Stanley’s newly appointed CEO, Ted Pick.Over the past six months, MS shares have gained almost 1% compared with the industry’s 13.2% growth.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'Last month, CNBC reported that Citigroup C is planning to reduce 51 job roles across its wealth segment in London. The move will likely affect 10% of its wealth segment workforce, comprising 485 employees.The majority of the job roles being eliminated would range from the post of assistant vice president to the director level. The elimination is likely to involve 21 job roles in C’s private bank division.The decision to eliminate job positions in the wealth segment comes as Citigroup aims to boost the unit’s returns after discouraging results witnessed in the last reported quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the segment’s efficiency ratio rose to 99% from 92% in the year-ago quarter.A chief operating officer of Citigroup stated, “The wealth business is continuing to identify areas to improve efficiency through structural changes and cost base reductions.”In January, it came to light that BlackRock BLK was planning to eliminate 600 jobs, accounting for 3% of the company’s total global workforce. The move is part of BLK’s efforts to streamline operations and adapt to a rapidly changing operating environment.Despite the elimination, BlackRock remains positive about its growth prospects. By the end of 2024, the company expects to employ more workforce as it plans to expand certain parts of its business.In a memo to its staff, BLK’s CEO Larry Fink and president Rob Kapito wrote, “We see our industry changing faster than at any time since the founding of BlackRock.

He said, listen, it's as healthy as he has ever seen it. But we were talking about how different names kind of reacting differently. You saw CrowdStrike, they reported, they're clearly capitalizing. Palo Alto Networks reported and very much disappointed, but that's a name you like, Ann. How come?"", 'ANN BERRY: Well, Palo Alto Networks is one when I invest on the private side, specifically, Josh. In the cybersecurity sector. I, for example, invested in a deepfake detection company.

This strategy focuses on companies that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase them over time. This approach offers a unique blend of income and growth potential, appealing to a broad range of investors. Additionally, it provides a sense of security in times of market uncertainty or downturns, as dividend-paying stocks can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.Stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, Toll Brothers TOL, Iron Mountain IRM, NetApp NTAP and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.', 'Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and, thus, act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty, as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increases in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock has appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers.

Several entertainment industry stocks had to tread through choppy waters due to several reasons. Last year we saw strikes from Hollywood writers and actors which brought content production to a standstill. On the other hand, persistent issues of advertising market weakness and ‘cord-cutting’ continued to burden profitability for the industry participants. For the uninitiated, cord-cutting refers to the behavior of viewers cancelling their subscriptions to multichannel television services available over cable or satellite, in favor of other forms of media services. A new potential threat as well as opportunity has arisen recently in the form of generative artificial intelligence. On the one hand, it can improve productivity, on the other it can raise challenges like trust, accuracy, privacy, and fairness.', 'Companies in the entertainment industry have been forced to take measures to protect shareholder value in the face of these challenges. Some of the players in the market are reportedly seeking consolidation opportunities in a bid to use scale to fight off adversity. Other industry participants have opted for innovative opportunities to increase revenues and profitability. For instance, the streaming giant Netflix, Inc.

That translates to an impressive 294% total return, which crushes the S&P 500's performance."", ""Let's take a closer look at this ETF."", ""The Vanguard Growth ETF owns 208 different stocks. These businesses usually post faster revenue and profit growth than most companies out there. Just in the last five years, the average business in the ETF put up a 19.6% annualized earnings gain. That's impressive."", 'However, these stocks are also more expensive.

Within 12 months, the value of the annualized revenue of OpenAI reached $2 billion by December 2023, with demand from business customers increasing significantly and the projections for 2025 showing this figure is set to more than double. Despite OpenAI's many accomplishments, though, its private nature is a challenge for investors wishing to be part of its expansion. There are no openly traded shares to buy, and so a direct investment is not an option for the general public. This is where software giant Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a visionary stake in OpenAI through its funding, comes in."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.', ""Microsoft's strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI indicates it is the company that will be at the forefront of the AI revolution and makes an interesting investment opportunity. The company began with a $1 billion investment in 2019, followed by an additional $10 billion and, as such, now holds a 49% ownership stake and rights to up to 75% of profits until the time it receives back its investment. The collaboration enables the incorporation of OpenAI technologies into all Microsoft products, which thus far has led to a substantial upsurge in sales."", 'The financial performance of Microsoft shows the technology giant is not only surviving, but also benefiting from the AI revolution. With the reported increase in revenue to $62 billion in the latest quarter, which represents 18% year-over-year growth, and cloud revenue surging by 24%, Microsoft exhibits a strong financial health and an aggressive pursuit of market share, mainly in the cloud sector.', ""The successful acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, which closed in October 2023, has lifted Microsoft's gaming division and is expected to generate additional revenues, besides giving it a stronger footing in the market. Activision will give the company a strong standing in the mobile gaming segment in which historically it was lagging behind. This step not only provides Microsoft with various revenue sources, but also strengthens its competitiveness in a market worth over $250 billion. As a result of this acquisition, the company is expected to grow its top line by 4.10% ($8.84 billion) in the coming year."", ""The rapidly growing cloud infrastructure market, which reached over $68 billion worldwide (up 18 % from the previous year), has undergone some dramatic changes. Such growth points to the fifth straight quarter of significant expansion and signifies the sturdy and continuing growth of the cloud sector. Inside this flourishing market, Microsoft Azure has shown remarkable growth and the market share has increased by approximately one point to 23%. This is in contrast to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which has consistently remained about 33%, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud, which has retained its place at 11%. The amounts in terms of revenue are as follows: about $15.6 billion for Microsoft, $22.4 billion for Amazon and $7.4 billion for Google."", ""It is worth noting competitors are maintaining their market share, which is happening across the board with the revenue pie becoming bigger, meaning even stability translates into significant growth of the overall market. The fact Microsoft's market share increased by 1% to reach 23%, mainly in the period of such growth, shows it is the most bullish of the giants in the tech industry. A key factor of this success has been the company's strategic vision to implement generative AI technologies with the support of its multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI. Microsoft Azure's incorporation of generative AI in its suite of day-to-day software products is not only riding the wave of cloud infrastructure expansion, but is also designing the future of how businesses and individuals interact with cloud services and AI technologies."", 'The expected decrease in inflation from 3% to 2.50% this year, as well as a lower probability of a recession, point to a very favorable macroeconomic background for Microsoft. Along with the strategic AI investments and the growth of the cloud infrastructure, the company, in my opinion, is well-positioned for continued growth.', 'In the coming months, the company is set to launch the Copilot chatbot for its Office 365 platform, which already has a significant user base of 345 million paid subscribers. Microsoft will offer the Copilot subscription for an extra $30 per month in addition to the existing fees. By assuming that 100 million users will subscribe, the company could see its annual revenue growth by at least $36 billion. This increase will represent an approximate 17% growth from the current annual revenue figures of $212 billion.', 'Microsoft has been beefing up its expenses, particularly with its cloud, AI and gaming platforms, but managed to expand its operating margin to 490 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2024, registering 43.60%. In view of this, the operating margin for the full year is expected to expand from 42.30% in 2023 to 43.70%, which will directly improve the bottom line.', ""Investors still have to pay attention to the issues of regulations and the related security risks. The AI market is dependent on ongoing demand, which is also influenced by technological advances, so investors need to balance opportunity with unpredictability. Microsoft's stock is not a bargain selling at forward price-earnings ratio of 35. In comparison, Alphabet, which is expected to achieve a similar rate of growth in earnings per share over the next three years, trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21. The higher valuation of Microsoft could limit its upside potential if Azure's growth suddenly declines.All in all, I think Microsoft is a company that shares its values with me personally and that is why I am sure of buying the stock. It is not just doing its best, but has grown its business and seems to be getting ahead of the competition in the cloud and AI sectors. The stock could experience some ups and downs in the short term, but should surge over the next couple of years."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Investors who simply purchased shares of Apple and did nothing else have historically done pretty well.', 'While there\'s a laundry list of catalysts that have lifted Apple\'s valuation over time, the company\'s success ultimately boils down to two factors: innovation and a surprising ""investment"" that\'s been highly beneficial to its shareholders.', ""To become one of the largest publicly traded companies, a business will generally have to grow at a sustained high rate and remain on the cutting edge of the innovation curve within its respective sector or industry. Peering back through more than 11 years of annual and quarterly filings, it's clear that Apple and its management team, led by CEO Tim Cook, aren't afraid to invest for the future."", 'Research and development (R&D) expenses have grown every year since the start of 2013 and total just over $175 billion through the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (Dec. 30, 2023):', '2013: $4.475 billion in R&D expenses', '2014: $6.041 billion', '2015: $8.067 billion', '2016: $10.045 billion', '2017: $11.581 billion', '2018: $14.236 billion', '2019: $16.217 billion', '2020: $18.752 billion', '2021: $21.914 billion', '2022: $26.251 billion', '2023: $29.915 billion', 'Q1 2024: $7.696 billion', ""Some of these growing R&D expenses are undoubtedly directed at keeping the company in the lead in the smartphone arena. Since Apple integrated 5G wireless technology into its flagship iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's seen its domestic market share in smartphones surge above 50%. Consumers tend to be exceptionally loyal to Apple's physical products, which include iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, among other accessories."", ""However, Apple's R&D spending goes beyond the physical products that brought the company fame. For years, Tim Cook has been overseeing the evolution of Apple's operations. Although it's still producing and improving its popular physical products, Apple is aiming to be a platforms company that's ultimately driven by subscriptions."", ""The advantage of the company's services focus is threefold:"", 'Subscriptions typically generate higher margins than physical products.', ""It'll further enhance the loyalty of Apple's customer base by keeping consumers within its ecosystem of physical products and services."", ""The steady revenue generated by Apple's Services segment will smooth out the sales fluctuations traditionally observed during iPhone upgrade cycles."", 'What\'s even more eye-popping than the $175.19 billion Apple has spent on R&D since the beginning of 2013 is its ""investment"" that\'s nearly quadrupled R&D in size over the same period.', ""With Apple generating boatloads of operating cash flow, it has the ability to take chances that most companies can't match. It can also reward shareholders in a way that no other business can."", ""On a nominal-dollar basis, Apple's dividend is one of the largest in the world. Last year, the company doled out just a hair over $15 billion to its shareholders as a dividend. But its share repurchase program is many multiples larger."", 'Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, Apple has overseen the repurchase of $650.88 billion worth of its common stock, which is tops among publicly traded companies:', '2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks', '2014: $45 billion', '2015: $35.253 billion', '2016: $29.722 billion', '2017: $32.9 billion', '2018: $72.738 billion', '2019: $66.897 billion', '2020: $72.358 billion', '2021: $85.971 billion', '2022: $89.402 billion', '2023: $77.55 billion', 'Q1 2024: $20.139 billion', 'The beauty of share buybacks is twofold. To start with, a declining share count incrementally increases the ownership stakes of existing investors.', ""But the second and arguably more important catalyst is that stock repurchases can increase a company's earnings per share (EPS). Businesses with steady or growing net income will see their EPS grow over time as their outstanding share count declines. This can make a company's stock appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors."", ""As an example, Apple's net income declined from $99.8 billion in fiscal 2022 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September) to roughly $97 billion in fiscal 2023. But thanks to Apple spending $77.55 billion on buybacks last year, which retired more than 513 million shares, the company's adjusted EPS actually increased by $0.02 to $6.13 per share in 2023, despite the $2.8 billion drop in net income."", 'Since the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased nearly 11 billion shares of common stock, or roughly 41% of its outstanding shares.', ""While buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's share price over the past 11 years and change, Wall Street and investors are likely eager to see one of the world's largest tech companies reignite its growth engine after it stalled out in 2023.

That, combined with gains of more than 20% from its bear-market bottom, checks the final criteria necessary to signal the onset of a bull market.', ""Despite those rather arbitrary benchmarks, there's reason for investors to be optimistic. Going back as far as 1926, bull markets have lasted 6.6 years, on average, generating gains of more than 339%, according to financial-services provider First Trust. A rising tide lifts all boats, or so the saying goes, so there's likely still plenty of gains to be had from the stock market's ongoing rally."", 'Furthermore, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have created a groundswell of interest, and adoption is accelerating. One of the companies best positioned to tap into the zeitgeist is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company moved swiftly to get a leg up in the AI market and is already profiting from its early moves.', ""It was arguably Microsoft's $13 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI that kicked off the generative AI-related frenzy that followed, but it was the introduction of Copilot -- the company's AI-powered digital assistant that should have investors most excited. Copilot is actually the generic name for a growing suite of AI-fueled helpers the company is adapting to a variety of use cases."", ""The most widely recognized is Copilot for Microsoft 365, which is deeply embedded in the company's Office Suite of productivity tools. Copilot helps automate many of the functions within Office, saving the user time and helping them become more productive. For example, Copilot can analyze data in Excel, create presentations in PowerPoint, and even make small work of emails in Outlook, all with just a few prompts from the user."", 'Microsoft has gone further, however, introducing a number of other Copilots for specific use cases. Over the past several months, the company has introduced Copilot for Sales, Copilot for Service, and Copilot for Finance, with each version bringing time savings and productivity enhancements to users -- and there are likely even more on the drawing board.', ""The evidence suggests Microsoft has a winner on its hands. A recent survey of Copilot users revealed that 77% reported that once they started using Copilot, they didn't want to stop."", ""The opportunity represented by Microsoft's AI efforts is clear, but there's also a halo effect that investors might not fully appreciate. Besides the potential for the broad uptake of Copilot, there's another way for the company to capitalize on the growing adoption of AI, namely Azure Cloud."", ""Azure Cloud, the world's second-largest cloud-infrastructure provider, has been taking share from its rivals -- and that appears poised to continue. In the final quarter of calendar 2023, Azure's revenue grew 30% year over year, outpacing both Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, which grew 26% and 13%, respectively."", 'In a gem hidden in Microsoft\'s earnings call, the company provided insight into what helped drive those gains, noting the results included ""six points of growth from AI services.""', ""This shows that as Copilot continues to gain ground, it will likely attract additional cloud users to Azure Cloud, further bolstering Microsoft's fortunes."", 'Estimates vary regarding how much Microsoft will ultimately profit from Copilot, but the forecasts continue to climb.', ""Analyst Sarah Hindlian-Bowler at Macquarie calculates that during its first full year of availability, Copilot could generate more than $14 billion in incremental annual-recurring revenue (ARR) -- and that's if just 10% of Microsoft's user base adopts its AI-fueled digital assistant. If a greater number of users adopt Copilot, the number could ultimately be conservative. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is much more bullish, suggesting generative AI could add more than $100 billion to Microsoft's results by 2027."", 'The significant gap between the two estimates suggests that this may not be an apples-to-apples comparison. It does, however, help illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity.', ""The evidence is clear that Microsoft is well positioned to benefit from the secular tailwinds of AI, yet despite that growth driver, it's remarkably affordable. The stock is currently selling for 34 times forward earnings, and while that's a slight premium to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500, the company's recent advances suggest a premium is warranted."", ""There's more good news. During the two most recent bull markets, Microsoft has outperformed the broader indexes by a wide margin. For example, during the bull market that ran from March 2009 to February 2020, the Nasdaq Composite returned 674%, while Microsoft stock soared 1,140%. This helps to illustrate the company's strong track record during bull markets -- one more reason investors should buy Microsoft stock before the Nasdaq soars higher."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Recently, Goldman Sachs lifted its S&P 500 index year-end target to 5200 which represents further 4% growth for the Index based on current levels.

Kostin believes that strong global GDP and a “slightly weaker” dollar will lead to positive EPS.', 'Wall Street added several consecutive weeks of market recovery since the last few days of October. The “Magnificent Seven”, which includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, have played a significant role in this bull run.

You can also take a detailed look at the 5 Cities with the Highest Debt in the US.', ""Debt, both at the personal and governmental levels, is a complex and multifaceted issue that can have far-reaching implications for individuals, communities, and entire nations. In the United States, cities are not immune to the challenges of debt, and for some, the burden can be particularly heavy. This debt can be in various forms, including general obligation bonds, pension liabilities, and unfunded mandates, among others. One key metric often used to gauge a city's debt load is debt per capita, which provides insights into the level of indebtedness relative to the population size."", ""To understand the gravity of the matter, it's essential to unpack the factors contributing to it. From pension obligations to infrastructure investment, each city's debt profile is shaped by a unique set of circumstances and decisions made by local governments over time. Additionally, the presence of major public companies headquartered in these cities can further influence their economic landscape and financial dynamics."", 'For instance, the city of New York, is often regarded as the financial capital of the world. With a population exceeding 8 million and a GDP rivaling that of many countries, New York City is a powerhouse of commerce and culture. However, it also carries a significant debt burden, with one of the highest debts per capita in the US.\xa0Despite its robust economy, the city grapples with challenges such as aging infrastructure, affordable housing shortages, and pension liabilities, which contribute to its debt load.', ""Similarly, Chicago, Illinois, known for its iconic skyline and vibrant arts scene, faces its own fiscal challenges. With debt per capita exceeding $8,000, the city struggles to balance its budget amidst pension obligations and declining population trends. Despite being home to major corporations such as Boeing and United Airlines, Chicago's city debt burden has now reached $42,000 for every taxpayer; this shows the need for comprehensive fiscal reform and prudent financial management.\xa0"", 'Beyond these examples, cities like Atlanta, Dallas, and Seattle, each offer unique insights into the complexities of municipal debt. From the booming tech sector in Seattle to the energy industry in Dallas, these cities are hubs of innovation and opportunity. Yet, they also confront challenges such as income inequality, infrastructure investment, and pension obligations, which contribute to their debt burdens.', ""Among many large companies that are situated in cities with higher debt; Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), another Seattle-based powerhouse, revolutionized the coffee industry and established itself as a global brand synonymous with quality and convenience. With thousands of coffee shops worldwide and a diverse portfolio of products, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) contributes significantly to Seattle's economy through job creation, tourism, and tax revenues.\xa0"", ""Despite the immense economic contributions of these companies, Seattle faces a stark reality in terms of its debt burden. According to recent municipal financial reports, Seattle's debt per capita exceeds $5,000, reflecting the challenges posed by infrastructure investment, pension obligations, and other fiscal commitments. This figure stands in stark contrast to the billions of dollars generated by Amazon.com, Inc.

Starbucks became a target for consumer boycotts protesting the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, after suing its union group for trademark infringement, after the union made a social post in October stating, “Solidarity with Palestine.” The layoffs mean that Starbucks’ growth prospects in the Middle East are slightly more bleak while the company continues facing consumer pressure among its U.S customers.', 'The boycotts are meant to protest the war in Gaza, ignited by the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. Israel’s response has been called an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe with a rising human cost: At least 17 children have starved to death and about 134 hostages remain in Gaza. President Joe Biden, widely criticized for supporting Israel, has lately called Israel’s response “over the top,” which he followed by calling for a temporary cease-fire. Biden recently announced plans to build a temporary port on Gaza’s coast to allow more humanitarian aid— which Israel has repeatedly obstructed, according to a report by Refugees International—to enter the strip.', 'The layoffs mean Starbucks’ growth prospects are “dimmer in the Middle East,” according to Diogenes Mejia, the director of S&P Global Ratings. It puts the coffee chain’s growth potential more in line with other fast-food giants, like McDonald’s and Yum Brands, that have become boycott targets, too.', 'But “what makes the impact to Starbucks unique” from other brands, he said, is that it has seen “some weakness in traffic among certain demographics in the United States,” one of the company’s most profitable markets.', '“To the extent that there’s contention and people boycotting in the U.S.,” Mejia said, it will have “a bigger impact on the company than if the same thing were to happen in the Middle East.”', 'Starbucks cited consumer boycotts as one reason for its slower than anticipated first-quarter sales, and also forecasted slower growth for the rest of the year. On an earnings call in January, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company saw “negative impact to our business in the Middle East” and that “events in the Middle East also had an impact in the U.S., driven by misperceptions about our position.” Rachel Ruggeri, Starbucks’ executive vice president, added she expects the conflicts will contribute to lower earnings in the second quarter of the year.', 'Because of the massive scale of the company, Mejia said, its international sales were still able to grow 7% in the first quarter. But the layoffs mean “whatever growth plans they had in the Middle East now become more complicated,” because “as a franchisee in that space, you always want to grow the number of stores you have. If you’re closing stores, that means your growth prospects are dimmer than maybe they were a year ago.”', 'Most of the company’s stores in the Middle East are licensed and-owned by Alshaya, which has owned the rights to operate the coffee shops since 1999. The group now runs over 1,900 stores in 11 Middle Eastern and North American markets and employs over 19,000 “green apron partners,” or Starbucks workers. The company’s 2,000 fired employees make up just a fraction of its entire workforce. Starbucks employs over 381,000 employees in 19,592 company-owned stores, and employs even more in its 18,446 licensed stores in the world.

On Thursday afternoon, just after 1 p.m. Pacific time, members of the REI Union National Steering Committee will be marching to the outdoor equipment and clothing purveyor’s headquarters in the Washington city of Issaquah with a singular demand: that it bargain with them in good faith.', 'More from Sourcing Journal', 'Union Wins Big: Supreme Court Declines Charleston Port Labor Dispute Case', ""Pilots at Amazon's Biggest Air Cargo Carrier Mulling Strike"", ""Amazon UK Workers Stage New Strike, Same Message: 'End Poverty Pay'"", 'The event is the culmination of two weeks of walks, bike rides and, indeed, hikes that employees at REI’s nine unionized stores, from SoHo, N.Y., to Maple Grove, Minn., have undertaken with their communities and co-op members to share one of 10 “essential” demands that they’ve been fighting for with support from the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store International Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.', 'A store in Boston, for instance, is highlighting “insulation,” referring to job security. Durham, N.C,. is pushing for “navigation,” meaning predictable scheduling that can keep employees on course at work and in their personal lives. Cleveland, Ohio, is championing “first aid,” or a viable sick policy, while Castleton, Ind., believes in “sun protection,” which includes adequate parental leave and job flexibility. In Berkeley, Calif., the second of REI’s 170 nationwide stores to unionize, employees are calling attention to “nutrition,” i.e., a leave and vacation policy that can sufficiently “nourish” their lives. For workers in SoHo, the first REI outlet to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for a union vote in 2022, the essential of “shelter” translates to a living wage and guaranteed minimum hours.', 'Asked for comment, “REI is committed to and will always negotiate in good faith with our stores that have chosen union representation,” a spokesperson said.', 'The negotiation process has been especially fraught, said Zoe Dunmire, an associate at the SoHo store, where workers have been bargaining for two years for a union contract. The day after they won their bid to unionize, REI announced that it would be handing out raises to every location except for theirs. Any tentative progress was also rolled back a year into negotiations when the retailer announced that it was changing its legal counsel to Morgan Lewis, which also represents Amazon “and their union busting,” she said. REI then made the “cruel choice” of cutting all the SoHo employees’ wages “ knowing that this would put extreme hurt on their workers.” A few weeks ago, Dunmire said, the company revealed that it would be excluding all unionized stores from the annual merit-based raises, “again violating our status quo.”', 'REI’s so-called stalling tactics are more than familiar to Victor Delgado, who works at the Berkeley outpost and called 2023 a “rough year in bargaining.” While the unionized workers finally received word about two tentative agreements this week after a year of talks with REI’s lawyers, not REI itself, the slow pace has been demoralizing. “The only way we can make any improvements or advancements is by unifying our efforts, and this is exactly what we’re doing here,” he said of the unionized stores’ decision to band together this way.', 'The REI Union National Steering Committee isn’t afraid of calling in the big guns, either. In November, unionized workers and their parent unions filed coordinated unfair labor practice charges with their regional NLRB offices to accuse the company also known as Recreational Equipment Inc. of bad faith bargaining practices and unilateral workplace changes, such as dismissals, work schedule modifications and disciplinary action, that characterize its “egregious anti-union behavior.”', 'REI’s recent spate of layoffs—more than 300 employees alone in January—has only fired up workers’ interest in the bargaining process, said Dave Hein, a shop mechanic at the Cleveland store. “The reason that is given is always that REI’s not profitable; REI’s not in a position to make money this year, despite billions in revenue,” he said. The retailer closed 2022 with a record $3.9 billion in sales, so “it’s not a question of are they making money? It’s a question of where are they spending it?” Hein added.', 'Writing to employees in January, CEO Eric Artz said that the year’s revenue is expected to be down from 2023 because of “macroeconomic conditions” that REI is anticipating for 2024. “When we plan our revenues down, we must adjust our plans and cost structure accordingly,” he added. “We must also continue our work to return REI to profitability to set the co-op up for long-term health and success.”', 'REI’s union members say they are energized by Starbucks’ volte-face this week that it will hash out a “foundational framework” on collective bargaining with the unions representing its workers. On Wednesday, \u200b\u200bthe Strategic Organizing Center, the coalition behind Starbucks Workers United, said that it would be dropping a proxy effort to add three members to the coffee Goliath’s board of directors.', '“I think this is a testament to kind of the power of organizing,” said Caleb Walker, a sales specialist from Boston. “Starbucks would have never made this decision if the workers there did not put pressure on the company through collective organizing.”', 'Walker also believes that an infusion of younger people in the labor movement has been a boon. “Starbucks employs a lot of young people and them kind of realizing that their market base is not going to tolerate this is where this is coming from,” they said. REI, Walker added, “also employs a lot of young people.”']"

And what that means is that it's increasingly a beverage you can't get anywhere else.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' View our latest analysis for Synopsys ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Synopsys has managed to grow EPS by 25% per year over three years. So it's not surprising to see the company trades on a very high multiple of (past) earnings."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Synopsys achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 19% to US$6.1b. That's a real positive."", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Synopsys' future profits."", ""Since Synopsys has a market capitalisation of US$86b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$374m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves."", ""It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Synopsys, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m."", ""Synopsys offered total compensation worth US$10m to its CEO in the year to October 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Synopsys' strong EPS growth. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. The overarching message here is that Synopsys has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Synopsys that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

During the training, managers also practice responding to different workplace scenarios, such as helping employees navigate bereavement leave or anxiety over global conflicts.', '“We felt like the time was right to expand this and scale it to all of our managers,” Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman’s global head of human capital management, tells Fortune. ""So many of our people are struggling right now with what\'s happening in the world.”', 'Mental health has become one of the top issues that employers must tackle, and companies have started pursuing various strategies to promote well-being among employees, including on-site therapy, extended time off policies, and volunteering opportunities.', 'This latest initiative from Goldman is just one of several recent mental well-being initiatives. The company launched a “mental health first aid” program in the U.S. in 2022, which trains employees to listen to colleagues’ issues and recommend relevant resources. It also offers employees free access to the meditation app Calm (note: Goldman has invested in the company).', 'Arthur says the latest virtual training aims to be part of a more holistic mental health support system for employees. But tasking managers with supporting workers’ mental health can be tricky to execute. I previously covered the debate around whether bosses should be responsible for addressing their subordinates’ mental health. Critics argue that leaders place unfair burdens on supervisors and press them to act as de facto therapists.', 'Arthur acknowledges this risk, and says a key part of the curriculum is that managers learn to “stay in role” and not cross boundaries by offering diagnostic opinions or treatment advice. Instead, supervisors are taught to direct employees to company resources, such as Goldman’s wellness team, or benefits options like its employee assistance program. Bosses are also encouraged to reach out to Goldman’s employee relations team or business partners team before speaking with employees to help strategize how they can talk with that worker and support them.', ""“We thought it was very important to make it clear what their role was, and that we're not mental health professionals,” she says. “It's important to be supportive of our employees and ultimately it’s also important to bring in the right expertise.”"", 'Supervisors at the company have around one month to complete the course. The company says managers will be evaluated in their performance reviews and employee surveys when it comes to how well they retain the information—workers will be asked to rate how effective they think their manager is, including how well they think their manager supports them.', 'Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidion', ""Today's edition was curated by Emma Burleigh."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Earnings rose 15% year over year on higher revenues, which were partially offset by higher operating costs and higher interest expenses.Total revenues of $8.2 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.16 billion. Total revenues rose 20% year over year, driven by higher product sales.Total product revenues increased 20% from the year-ago quarter to $7.83 billion (U.S.: $5.87 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.96 billion). Higher volumes were partially offset by lower selling prices of several drugs. Volumes rose 23% in the quarter, partially offset by a 3% lower net selling price.Other revenues were $363 million in the quarter, up 26.5% year over year.Products like Prolia, Repatha, Blincyto and Evenity achieved double-digit volume growth in the quarter. Horizon’s products added $954 million in sales in the quarter. Excluding the contribution from Horizon, product sales grew 5% while volumes rose 9%.', 'General MedicineProlia revenues came in at $1.1 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter, driven by volume growth (10%) and higher net selling prices. Prolia sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.03 billion.Evenity recorded sales of $318 million in the quarter, up 41% year over year, driven by solid volume growth in and outside the United States. Evenity sales slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $322 million as well as our model estimate of $318.2 million.Repatha generated revenues of $417 million, up 25% year over year, as volume growth of 35% was partially offset by lower prices due to new formulary coverage by CVS in July for commercial patients. Repatha sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $428 million and our model estimate of $426.5 million. Amgen expects the additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which should more than offset declining net selling price.Aimovig recorded sales of $78 million in the quarter, down 32% year over year due to lower net selling price.Hematology-OncologyXgeva delivered revenues of $527 million, up 9% year over year, driven by higher net selling prices.Kyprolis recorded sales of $350 million, up 8% year over year, driven by volume growth.Vectibix revenues came in at $251 million, up 5% year over year, driven by volume growth.Nplate sales declined 18% to $386 million due to the unfavorable timing of an order from the United States government. Excluding the unfavorable timing of the U.S. government orders, Nplate sales grew 23% year over year for the fourth quarter, driven by volume growth across its U.S. and ex-U.S. regions.Blincyto sales increased 47% from the year-ago period to $241 million, driven by volume growth as the drug benefited from broad prescribing for patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Lumakras/Lumykras recorded sales of $77 million in the quarter, up 8% from the year-ago period due to higher volumes and net selling prices. Lumakras/Lumykras sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90 million as well as our model estimate of $92.2 million.In oncology biosimilars, sales of Kanjinti (Amgen’s biosimilar of Roche’s Herceptin) were $42 million, down 33% year over year due to lower pricing and volumes as a result of increased competition.Sales of Mvasi (biosimilar of Roche’s Avastin) were $188 million in the quarter, down 8% year over year, due to lower pricing, which offset the impact of volume growth.InflammationSales of Otezla were $629 million in the quarter, up 2%, due to favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth which offset the impact of lower pricing and lower inventory levels. On the fourth-quarter conference call, Amgen said that it is seeing a reduced impact of the free drug programs launched by new competitors in the United States, which had hurt sales in the past few quarters. Otezla sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $618.0 million as well as our estimate of $606.4 million.Enbrel revenues of $1.02 billion declined 8% year over year due to unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower pricing, which offset the impact of slightly improved volumes in the United States. Enbrel sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our model estimate of $1.06 billion.Improved payer coverage led to an increase in new patients, which, in turn, resulted in some better volume growth for Enbrel in the past three quarters. However, prices are expected to continue to decline due to higher rebates to maintain broad first-line payer coverage and changes in patient mix.Sales of Otezla and Enbrel are expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the other quarters per historical trends due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.Newly approved asthma drug Tezspire (tezepelumab) recorded sales of $177 million in the quarter, up 10% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Tezspire volumes benefited from the launch of a self-administered, pre-filled, single-use pen formulation of the drug in the first quarter. The pen formulation helped expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers, which led to higher new patient growth in 2023.Amgevita sales were $160 million in the quarter, up 34% year over year, driven by 35% volume growth.Rare DiseaseAmgen closed the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion on Oct 6, 2023, which added several rare disease drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to AMGN’s portfolio.Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna generated sales of $448 million, $272 million and $65 million from Oct 6 to Dec 31, 2023.New drug Tavneos generated $44 million in sales in the fourth quarter compared with $37 million in the previous quarter. The drug’s 19% sequential growth was driven by new patient volume growth. Tavneos, approved for the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, a severe systemic autoimmune disease, was added to Amgen’s portfolio with the 2022 acquisition of ChemoCentryx.Established ProductsTotal sales of established products, which include Epogen, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Neulasta, decreased 10% year over year in the quarter.', 'Adjusted operating margin rose 0.8 percentage points to 46.7% in the quarter.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10\xa0Countries that Have the Largest Gold Reserves.', 'Gold hit a record high after the precious metal scaled to $2,100 per ounce on March 5. The “safe-haven” asset further escalated to $2,141.59 per ounce, surpassing the previous record of $2,135 in December 2023. The rally sky-rocketed following rising bets for the US Fed expected to cut interest rates in June 2024 and on safe-haven demand due to escalation in the Middle East conflict. With increasing speculations of rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the interest rates will start to come down this year, but he is not ready yet to predict the exact timing. On March 6, during congressionally mandated appearances on Capitol Hill, Powell said policymakers remain attentive to the risks that inflation poses and do not want to ease up too quickly. He further added:', '“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.”', 'Gold has recorded a surge in its price for being a safe-haven asset. The precious metal is primarily used as the most reliable investment in securing assets during political and financial uncertainty. The price of gold has increased by over $300 per ounce since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. Some analysts believe that the gold price could surge past the $2,300 mark. On March 5, The Guardian reported that a senior analyst at ActivTrades, Ricardo Evangelista, said that the increasing concerns regarding the global economic outlook, geopolitical tensions, and changing expectations towards interest rate cuts have sparked the demand for gold, leading to an increase in its price. The chief investment officer at Charles Stanley, Patrick Farrell, pointed out that gold prices would probably soon peak. Here is what Farrell said:\xa0', '“It has been a grim year for many commodities. A confluence of weakening economic growth, particularly from China, plus an adjustment after some post-pandemic exuberance, has seen the prices for energy, industrial metals, and ‘energy transition’ commodities such as copper and nickel drop.”', ""Unlike fiat currencies, gold retains its value against all the odds in the market including inflation and other market tensions. Gold’s nature against inflationary pressures makes it the best hedge against inflation, especially in countries that have the largest gold reserves.

The gold demand was 8% ahead of its five-year average at 1,147 tonnes in Q3 2023, excluding OTC. The total demand for gold was up by 6% year-over-year at 1,267 tonnes including OTC and stock flows. The net central bank buying was reported around 337 tonnes, which was the third strongest quarter in the World Gold Council's data series. However, the net central bank buying failed to reach the staggering 459 tonnes figure from Q3 2022. Still, the demand for gold buying from central banks year-to-date is 14% ahead of the same period in 2022, at a record 800 tonnes.

As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NextEra Energy, beginning with the chart below."", ' View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""We can see that NextEra Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NextEra Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", 'Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NextEra Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.7% of the company stock.', 'On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance.

Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$193m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

But there's another issue facing utilities, given that these capital-intensive businesses make heavy use of debt financing. Thus, rising costs are a second headwind for the sector."", ""Over the long term, however, regulated utilities should adjust and continue to provide reliable income streams to shareholders. If you think in decades, you'll want to consider adding NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Black Hills Corporation (NYSE: BKH), and Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) to your portfolio in March."", ""NextEra Energy's 3.7% dividend yield is modest compared to the other two utilities on this list. In fact, it is only 10 basis points above the average of the broader utility sector. But the yield is near a 10-year high for NextEra Energy, suggesting the stock is cheap today."", 'However, the real linchpin in the story is the average annualized dividend growth of around 10% over the past decade, extremely high by utility standards.\xa0Management expects to raise the dividend by that much again in 2024.', ""The story here comes in two parts. First, NextEra Energy owns the largest utility in Florida, which is a state with a growing population. That's the solid foundation. On top of that, NextEra Energy owns one of the world's largest portfolios of solar and wind power assets. This is a growth business, with management hoping to double its clean energy capacity by 2026."", ""The combination of these two businesses is expected to produce earnings growth of between 6% and 8% a year through 2026. Even if dividend growth only tracks along with earnings growth after 2024, that's still a great outcome for a growth- and income-oriented utility. Investors should look at this stock, which has increased its dividend annually for nearly three decades and is still on sale."", ""Compared to NextEra Energy, Black Hills Corporation is a bit of a snooze. The company is relatively small in the utility sector, with a modest market cap of just $3.5 billion (NextEra's market cap is $110 billion, for reference). It serves 1.3 million natural gas and electricity customers across parts of eight Western and Mid-Western states. Black Hills is nothing more than a small, traditional, regulated utility."", 'However, the regions it serves are growing at nearly 3 times the rate of the U.S. population, which is good for long-term growth. That backing has allowed Black Hills to achieve Dividend King status. Sure, the dividend has grown at just 5% a year on average over the past decade.', ""But that's more than enough to outpace the historical inflation growth rate and is a pretty solid number in the utility space. And while rising interest rates will be a short-term headwind, it seems highly unlikely that this fact alone will upend Black Hills' slow and steady growth over the long term. Conservative income investors will want to do a deep dive while the dividend yield is near decade highs at 5%."", ""The last utility here will be an acquired taste, largely attractive to investors interested in turnaround stories. The dividend yield is just shy of 6%. The problem is that the dividend will likely be static for at least another few years as the utility revamps its asset portfolio. It is also attempting to reduce leverage and bring its payout ratio more in line with its utility peers. But if you can stomach a stock with a dividend that isn't going to grow for a bit, Dominion is well into its turnaround plan."", 'The first step was a major review of the business, which has now been completed. It has already inked deals to sell a number of assets, with the proceeds from the sales earmarked for debt reduction. These sales will take place over the next year or so. After that is complete, management expects earnings growth of between 6% and 8% annually through 2029.', ""Assuming management can execute that goal, Wall Street will likely get increasingly upbeat on the future. And the payout ratio will slowly decline into the company's target range in the mid-60% space. When that happens, dividend growth will return. Although that could take between three and five years, the 6% yield is material enough to make it a worthwhile wait for turnaround investors."", ""The utility sector is filled with unique stories, as are most sectors. If you like dividend growth stocks, you'll appreciate NextEra Energy's tale. If you like slow and conservative investments, Black Hills will be the story for you. And if you are a bit more adventurous, high-yield Dominion Energy will probably be of interest."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

High interest expenses owing to the debt incurred for the Inmarsat acquisition adversely impacted the bottom line during the quarter. The bottom line was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents.Excluding non-recurring items, Viasat recorded a non-GAAP net income of $29.7 million or 24 cents per share against a net loss of $10.9 million or a loss of 14 cents per share in the prior-year period.RevenuesRevenues surged 58% to $1.1 billion, driven by solid growth in product and service revenues. The top line surpassed the consensus estimate by 9 million.Product revenues were $303.1 million, up from $249.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales from Service more than doubled to $825.5 million from $402.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Revenues from Satellite Services improved to $581.4 million from $302.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The nearly two-fold rise was driven by healthy demand for commercial air IFC services and incremental contribution from the Inmarsat buyout. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA more than tripled to $288.5 million from $90.4 million, backed by higher commercial air IFC service activations and a full quarter contribution from Inmarsat.Revenues from Commercial Networks remained relatively flat at $166.4 million as lower revenues from commercial air IFC terminal deliveries were offset by incremental contribution from Inmarsat. Adjusted EBITDA came in at a loss of $35.1 million compared with a loss of $19.2 million a year ago.The Government Systems segment registered revenues of $380.8 million from continuing operations, up 109% year over year, driven by solid Inmarsat contribution. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $129.7 million, up from $50.9 million, backed by the contribution from Inmarsat and solid product revenues.Other DetailsIn the December quarter, the company reported an operating loss of $156.5 million compared with an operating loss of $39.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $383.1 million, up from $138.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash Flow & LiquidityDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Viasat generated an operating cash flow of $134 million compared with $89 million in the prior-year period.

Lodging stands out as the most significant service category, generating $10.26 billion in revenue in 2023, underscoring the company's strong position in the online travel market."", 'Expedia generates revenue by charging commissions on travel bookings made through its platform. This revenue comes from the gross bookings, which represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions. Expedia earns a percentage of these gross bookings as its revenue, known as the revenue margin. Therefore, the company can increase its revenue in two ways: by increasing gross bookings or by improving the revenue margin.', 'Since 2005, the company has successfully grown its gross bookings every year, with the exception of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Overpriced Housing Markets in America.', 'The US housing market was subject to a rigid crisis in 2023. The home prices kept on rising while the existing supply of houses was not enough to cater to the high demand. On October 20, 2023, CNN reported that home sales hit a 13-year low in September 2023. A large proportion of would-be buyers were unable to attain a home due to soaring interest rates in addition to expensive houses. You can take a look at some of the overpriced housing markets in the US in 2023. Furthermore, the monthly payment on an average-priced home required 40% of the median household income. Another dilemma was that the existing homeowners held on to their houses since they had to pay a higher interest on a new house.', ""As reported by Forbes, many first-time homebuyers still remain out of the US housing market. The affordability concerns powered by the high mortgage rates and a serious shortage of inventory in 2023 continue to persist. Experts have referred to the pre-pandemic housing market as 'hot' while the 2023 market remained 'cold' due to the aforementioned issues. The 2024 market is better but still doesn't offer just the right conditions for homebuyers."", 'For the housing market to make a real recovery, certain conditions need to be met. Firstly, an increase in inventory is crucial to meet the high demand. Simultaneously, a cooling down of mortgage rates is necessary. An additional factor to consider in this regard is that quickly falling mortgage rates lead to soaring demand which ends up ruining the inventory gains in the market. Therefore, a rather steady decline over a longer period has been expected to favor the US housing industry.', 'After a year of discouraging circumstances for homebuyers, the housing market appears to be offering something to look forward to. A positive builder sentiment was recorded in February which implies that these builders see improved conditions for new construction. Previously in January, new single-family building permits also experienced an increase.', 'Similarly, the spring housing market tends to especially depict positive conditions. On March 6, Fortune reported that an 18% increase in the number of homeowners who wished to sell their houses in the next 12 months was witnessed during a December 2023 Survey. The coming spring in 2024 could turn out to be a seller’s sweet spot if a stable or lower interest rate persists or newly constructed homes are available for them to settle in.', 'On March 6, CNBC also reported that the mortgage applications to buy a home have witnessed a rise. An increase in new listings has been considered a good sign for the spring buying season. During February, 14.8% more homes were seen actively for sale as compared to the same period in 2023.', 'The US housing market offers various options to those seeking investments in real estate. Some of the largest homebuilders in the US\xa0that dominate the US housing sector include\xa0PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), KB Home (NYSE:KBH), and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN).

(NYSE: PHM) reported the grand opening of ‘Rookery Lane at Concord’ which is the company’s new Boston-area community. The community is situated such that it offers a convenient commute to Concord and Boston. Hiking trails and parks in the vicinity can also be enjoyed by the residents at Rookery Lane at Concord. Pricing for attached homes begins at $1,339,995.', 'KB Home (NYSE:KBH) is another dominant American home construction company that builds personalized homes as per the homebuyer’s budget. On March 1, the company reported the grand opening of its new community in San Jacinto, California. The community ‘Rancho Madrina’ allows residents to undertake recreational activities such as boating, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and camping. Riverside County’s major employment centers can also be accessed. Prices for the new homes from KB Home (NYSE:KBH) start from the $490,000s.', 'Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) is an American home construction company that constructs affordable, move-up, and active adult homes. The homebuilder is also involved in the development of high-quality multifamily rental properties. On March 7, Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) reported the company’s plans for a master-planned Active Adult community for homebuyers aged 55 and above in northern Lancaster County. Model homes are expected to be completed in the summer of 2024. Downtown Lancaster can be easily visited by the residents of the community.

The news is extremely important, but neither of these companies might be the primary beneficiary. Instead, investors should look to aerospace suppliers like Hexcel (NYSE: HXL) and Carpenter Technology\xa0(NYSE: CRS). Here\'s why.', 'While a deal hasn\'t been agreed upon at the time of writing, Boeing\'s management said in a press release ""the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems\' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders.""', ""What wasn't explicitly mentioned was the critical necessity of enabling Boeing to meet its delivery targets, notably on the 737 MAX program. As previously discussed, Boeing's medium-term plan is to hit 400 to 450 deliveries of the 737 in 2023 and then hike its monthly production rate on the 737 to 50 a month (implying an annual rate of 600) in the 2025/2026 time frame."", 'Unfortunately, Boeing is falling behind on those targets by only delivering 396 of the 737 MAX in 2023 and expects to move toward a rate of 38 a month in the second half, subject to Federal Aviation Administration oversight following the passenger door blowout on Alaska Air flight in early 2024.', 'Unfortunately, Spirit AeroSystems, the manufacturer of fuselages on the 737, is front and center of the manufacturing quality issues that have dogged Boeing over the last year. Its former CEO, Tom Gentile, complained in September that its contracts with Boeing and Airbus were ""not sustainable"" in the current environment.', ""In a nutshell, a combination of the supply chain crisis created by the pandemic lockdowns and soaring raw material costs, partly as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, has led to severe financial pressure on suppliers. In turn, that's put stress on production rates at Boeing and Airbus."", 'Gentile resigned in October and was promptly replaced by Boeing veteran Pat Shanahan, with Boeing moving to sign a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with Spirit to help ensure the production of fuselages.', ""Whether it's a financially supportive MoA with Spirit, an acquisition of the company, or any other form of agreement, one thing is clear: Boeing needs fuselages from Spirit, and it needs to resolve manufacturing quality issues on them to get back on track with its 2025/2026 delivery targets."", ""Given Boeing's debt situation, this isn't precisely what Boeing shareholders had in mind for 2024, but derisking its delivery aims is necessary."", 'While Boeing is likely to face more financial pressure and operational complexity due to a deal, it has little choice. That might not be an ideal scenario for Boeing. Still, it is good news for aerospace suppliers who need an increase in production to sell their solutions to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) on Boeing programs.', 'Advanced composite company Hexcel is one example. Advanced composites offer weight and strength advantages over traditional materials that tend to more than offset their additional costs in terms of long-term productivity gains.', ""There's very little aftermarket demand for its products, so it needs airplane manufacturers to ramp up production. Its composites are the industry's future, and its content per plane tends to increase with the launch of any updated model. As such, Hexcel stands to benefit from both an increase in production and the development of new models using more composite technology."", 'Another example comes from an aerospace supplier like Carpenter Technology, which makes engine parts, fasteners, and structural and avionics parts. Unlike Hexcel, Carpenter also has a significant maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) business, meaning it also profits from increased flight departures as airplanes will need more servicing.', ""Given its relatively high fixed costs, Carpenter's margins can expand dramatically with increasing revenue, and a derisking of airplane manufacturers' production expansion plans is a significant benefit to the company. It's already on track to increase its profit margin as the aerospace recovery continues, and the latest news from Boeing is a plus for the company."", ""The big news from Boeing is more of a plus for aerospace suppliers like Hexcel and Carpenter Technology, who rely on Boeing to bolster production, than it is for Boeing itself. Meanwhile, the massive jump in Spirit AeroSystems' share price might indicate you have missed the boat if you were not in the stock before the news was announced."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Worst Performing Stocks in S&P 500.', 'The S&P 500 Index was up nearly 6.9% year-to-date, as of February 26, and continues its rally that started in late October. The rally was supported by investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts in 2024 as the Federal Reserve’s battle to control inflation seems to be bearing fruit. Recently, Goldman Sachs lifted its S&P 500 index year-end target to 5200 which represents further 4% growth for the Index based on current levels. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast from 4700 which was announced in its 2024 Outlook report in December.', 'Goldman Sachs is forecasting an 8% profit increase for the companies in the S&P 500 index, led by strong mega-cap profit margins and improved macroeconomic outlook in the country. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, expects the earnings strength of mega-cap stocks, especially those in the Magnificent 7, boosting aggregate S&P 500 profits in 2024. Kostin believes that strong global GDP and a “slightly weaker” dollar will lead to positive EPS.', 'Wall Street added several consecutive weeks of market recovery since the last few days of October. The “Magnificent Seven”, which includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, have played a significant role in this bull run. These stocks benefitted heavily from the significant breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence. For instance, GPU-maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up more than 430% since the beginning of 2023 and nearly 63% year-to-date, fueled by exponential growth in its revenue.', 'Our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500 includes companies from sectors that have been severely impacted by the recent adversity in the stock markets. The list includes companies from nine different sectors with a notable absence – the technology sector. In addition to suffering from macroeconomic and industry-wide market adversity, the stocks on our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500 have suffered from individual negative catalysts as well. For instance, Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), the second worst performing stock in S&P 500 year-to-date, is reeling from an accounting scandal as it put its CFO on an administrative leave in late January which saw its stock plummet 24% in a single day.', 'To recap, the Federal Reserve rapidly increased the interest rates beginning from near zero before March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range, the highest benchmark rate in the country in 22 years. This led to the failure of several banks in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with $209 billion assets, and Signature Bank with $110 billion assets, in March, and First Republic Bank with $229 billion assets in May 2023.', 'Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay', 'Methodology', 'To create our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500, we first ranked the S&P 500 stocks based on their year-to-date performance. The stocks in this article have been ranked based on their year-to-date performance, with the worst performing stock ranked the highest.

Feeding that many people will demand advances in sustainable farming, especially in aquaculture. John Benzie, PhD, Karim Gharbi, PhD, and Tarang Mehta, PhD, recently spoke with Illumina about how their organizations are improving farmed tilapia through genomics, with the ultimate aim of improving aquaculture in the developing world.', 'WorldFish: Better aquaculture through selective breedingBenzie is principal scientist at WorldFish, based in Penang, Malaysia. His organization works to transform aquatic food systems to reduce hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. One of their most groundbreaking achievements to date is the genetically improved farmed tilapia, or GIFT, a selectively bred strain of Nile tilapia introduced in 1988 that grows twice as fast as wild varieties and to a larger size.', ""Tilapia is the second-most-farmed fish in the world, after carp. It can be raised on small farms, and it's an important source of protein, iron, potassium, and other nutrients for developing nations in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Benzie explained that GIFT's faster growth means a farmer can grow more fish in a shorter season, which could make all the difference in whether they turn a profit on their investment."", ""Keeping small-farm production both economically and environmentally sustainable is one of WorldFish's primary interests. The organization makes GIFT's germplasm available to research organizations or national governments that agree to use it responsibly, and by their estimations, today GIFT is farmed in 14 countries and constitutes fully half of the world's tilapia production."", 'WorldFish continues to improve fish traits through their selective breeding programs, which primarily look for disease resistance and ability to withstand changes in temperature and salinity.', 'Benzie described how these programs work, step by step: ""Every year we take out old fish from the previous generation. We make calculations based on the pedigree we have-we know how they\'re all related to each other-and we use the best fish to breed the next generation."" They choose promising males and females to pair, incubate their eggs, and raise the newborn fish. ""We keep each family separate so we know who is who-who the parents were-and we then take these fish at three months of age, and put in a little microtransponder so we can identify each individual fish."" Then the fish are moved to a bigger tank once they reach adulthood, and the process starts over again.', ""Decisions about which pairs to breed can be made significantly faster, and more accurately, if they know their fish's genetic information-and they've found just the right partner to unlock this knowledge."", 'The Earlham Institute: Finding the right genes for the jobThe Earlham Institute is a life science research hub in Norwich, England, that uses genomics to decode the scale and complexity of living systems. Karim Gharbi, its head of Genomics Pipelines, researched genetic markers in fish for his PhD-he credits his career to a lifelong fascination with the documentaries of Jacques Cousteau.', 'His colleague Tarang Mehta is a postdoctoral researcher seeking to understand the basis of gene regulation in fish, specifically how some genes are linked to better salinity adaptation in certain tilapia species but not others. He hopes that, with sufficient genomic information, WorldFish could breed tolerance to fluctuating salinity into species that are farmed in developing countries.', 'The Earlham Institute isolates their DNA samples from tiny pieces of fin collected from live fish across the world and sequences them using the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus System. Then, by analyzing the generated data, they can identify genetic markers that express desirable traits.', 'Among those traits, disease resistance may be the most critical-tilapia lake virus alone is responsible for up to 90% of tilapia mortality worldwide. ""Once we have a disease developing in a particular farming industry like aquaculture,"" Gharbi said, ""this can start spreading from farm to farm, and every outbreak event is a loss to the farmer. The faster we can help farmers grow fish less susceptible to disease, the less income they will lose.""', ""Having access to an animal's genome is a breakthrough that changes how organizations like WorldFish can operate: Previously, breeders had to directly expose fish to a virus in order to select individuals who showed better resistance to it. Now they can avoid this step, arriving at answers faster and without causing unnecessary harm."", ""The NovaSeq X Series: Fast, accurate, and sustainableThe Earlham Institute serves many users in the UK and beyond who depend on them to generate high-quality data quickly, affordably, and sustainably, and Gharbi and Mehta both attest to the NovaSeq X Series' strengths in that arena."", 'Under optimal conditions, Gharbi said, they can receive samples from WorldFish and return results within five days. And in a recent evaluation of the institute\'s ""green impact,"" the NovaSeq X Series\' sustainable reagents helped them demonstrate their efforts to reduce waste.', '""The Illumina NovaSeq X is a cutting-edge technology,"" Mehta added, ""which allowed us both the speed and scale to sequence some of the things that we require with regards to genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetic sequencing."" Taking multiomic approaches gives them more power to apply their findings to their mission of improving food security.', 'As he spoke about the institute, Mehta reinforced time and again how important it is to him to translate the work they\'re doing at the genomic level directly into sustaining food biodiversity. ""In a rapidly changing world, where disease is not going to wait for us and a changing environment is not going to wait for us,"" he said, ""it\'s important for us to have not only just the speed, but also the scale of data quickly-for us to translate these findings to then move quickly back into the field to better inform genomic selection breeding programs.""', 'Fish can drown', 'It might sound counterintuitive, but fish can actually suffocate if there isn\'t enough oxygen in their water. Benzie explained that many farmers in WorldFish\'s areas of concern lack the means to aerate their ponds at night-when the algae present stop photosynthesizing oxygen, but the fish are still consuming it. Then, oxygen levels can fall so low overnight that the fish can drown. ""Farmers, in order to avoid that effect, stock about half the amount that you would stock if you could aerate,"" he said. This creates an unfortunate cycle: Less stock means lower profits, and even less chance to upgrade farm infrastructure to accommodate more fish. One piece of the solution, then, is fish that are bred to tolerate lower oxygen levels.', ""WorldFish's genetically improved strain of farmed tilapia constitutes half of the world's tilapia production.

Over the past 10 years, the company has invested more than $10 billion in strengthening the power grid through programs and initiatives approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). Georgia Power continued this ongoing work on projects throughout Georgia communities in 2023 resulting in a strong year for reliability performance."", '""At Georgia Power, we understand the importance of reliability for every customer and our teams share a commitment to work safely around the clock, and across the state, to deliver the power that our customers require,"" said Tami Barron, senior vice president of Distribution for Georgia Power. ""As we continue to upgrade our state\'s power grid, we\'re making purposeful investments using a data-driven approach, and increasingly incorporating automated technology that helps our electric system better respond not only during storms, but every day.""', 'Reliability is measured in two ways: frequency of service interruptions, or ""System Average Interruption Frequency Index"" (SAIFI), and duration of service interruption, or ""System Average Interruption Duration Index"" (SAIDI). Last year, Georgia Power\'s SAIFI score was among the best in the company\'s history, with customers experiencing an average of 15% fewer power outages than the previous year. Additionally, when customers did experience power outages, restoration times were approximately 27 minutes faster than the previous year. This duration measurement, or SAIDI value, was one of the best performances in recent years.', 'High service reliability in 2023 was driven, in large part, by the continued installation of smart, automated devices throughout the power grid. Last year alone, crews installed more than 1,000 automated devices across the state, which can be controlled remotely. This technology allows Georgia Power\'s operations team to reroute power and segment a power line, which isolates issues and results in fewer customers affected by an outage, and faster restoration for others. Georgia Power is also deploying smart devices and other technology to enhance its self-healing network designed to respond to power outages automatically – saving valuable time and quickly getting the lights back on for customers. More than 60% of the company\'s distribution grid can now be considered ""self-healing,"" helping avoid thousands of power outages each year.', ""In addition to installing smart technology, Georgia Power's ongoing investments in the grid in recent years include: upgrading or rebuilding transmission lines and dozens of substations across Georgia for safe and reliable power delivery to homes and businesses; relocation of hundreds of miles of power lines underground, where it made the most impact; and improvement or installation of tens of thousands of power poles. All this infrastructure works together to improve reliability through a stronger and more resilient power grid and helped deliver last year's high reliability."", '""Georgia benefits from an integrated transmission system that includes nearly 20,000 miles of high-voltage power lines used by all of this state\'s power companies to deliver energy from power generation sources to customers,"" said Fran Forehand, senior vice president of Transmission for Georgia Power.

In 2023, the company\'s generation fleet helped keep reliability high with experienced teams at hydro, natural gas, nuclear and coal-fired generation plants managing plant operations and maintenance activities at a level of excellence well above industry standards. Non-nuclear generation assets measure reliability with plant outage rate or ""equivalent forced outage rate"" (EFOR). Last year, Georgia Power\'s EFOR score was among the best in company history and among the best in the industry, with an outage rate of 1.49%. Georgia Power also continues to add renewable energy and battery energy storage to its generation mix, with reliability at the center of its planning process, and the company\'s existing solar generation performing strongly as well in 2023.', '""When extreme heat or cold, like we saw with Winter Storm Heather, drives increased demand for electricity, our Generation teams are at work 24/7 in Georgia\'s power plants,"" said Rick Anderson, senior vice president and production officer for Georgia Power. ""We\'re proud of the performance of our fleet last year and thank our team for their continued focus on reliability, as well as affordability by keeping production costs as low as possible for customers.""', ""Georgia Power continues to invest in a stronger and more resilient power grid through its successful multi-year Grid Investment Program, which has already resulted in an up to 50% improvement in reliability for some customers.

But that I will now turn the call over to Terrie Curran, Darden's President and CEO, to kick us off. Gary."", 'Terrie Curran', ""Thank you, Eric, and thank you to all those joining us on today's call. This is our first earnings call as a commercial company. I'm excited to report on the progress we've made during both the fourth quarter 2023 and the start of the calendar year 2024. In that short period, we've achieved many regulatory manufacturing, financial and commercial milestones, demonstrating the significant experience and dedication of our teams. In November, we set out with three initial goals for the early stages of launch to communicate equivalence, clinical superiority versus the PPI. drive awareness with physicians and build access to commercial patients. Today, I am proud to share that with delivering on those goals, prescribers have quickly recognize the Quest is differentiated and novel mechanism of action. Our reps are even sharing stories of physicians echoing the craziness, rapid potent and durable acid suppression profile. Excitement is translating into demand with thousands of scripts being written since product became available after over 30 years since the first PPI. was approved, very strong demand for something new further, the number of patients who have used the questioner is growing daily. To me. This is one of the most rewarding elements valuable, which surround reps, employees and sometimes even the friends and family. I'm hearing stories of long-suffering patients who are experiencing noticeable improvement with the questioner. We're working hard to ensure as many patients as possible can access for Christmas and share that experience. In fact, with our recent Express Scripts win. We're well on our way to securing widespread coverage for commercial patients. These early indicators, along with our present massive commercial success in Japan, have reinforced my belief in the closeness bright future here in the US with an erosive good market of approximately 7 million US adults, positive feedback from physicians and patients and anticipated label expansions. We remain confident in our belief that because that has the potential to reach annual peak revenues of greater than $3 billion. As for our early launch data, I'm happy to report that over 3,800 prescriptions have been filled for the quote new products. For clarity. This includes scripts captured by our QBO as well as those that were filled through Blink Rx. We specified fill because we have simultaneous leading monitoring and estimate of total demand, which we believe paints a comprehensive picture of the early and growing physician interest in writing because new products we estimate upwards of 14,000 total prescriptions have been written to date. We're pleased with this magnitude of total demand and see it as an indicator of what's on the horizon for the business as we continue pursuing broad payer coverage. Last month, the questioner was added to Express Scripts national formularies for commercial patients. In line with our goal. We secured placement with a single step edit through our generic PPI. As a result, the question of bottles access expanded to an estimated 60 million commercially covered lives. We believe our ability to obtain commercial formulary placements with one of the nation's largest PBMs. So quickly after approval indicates that our pricing and access strategy is resonating well with payers. We remain actively engaged with other major PBMs and health plans, and we expect further expansion of commercial coverage throughout 2020. For ultimately, as this coverage comes online, we anticipate the gap between total demand and FieldScripts will narrow significantly as we continue to execute on the launch, our R&D team remains focused on advancing pipeline opportunities for them. At present in December, we announced that the FDA had accepted our nano roasted good daily dosing NDA and assigned to produce a target action date of July 19th, 2024. We are now only four months away from that decision date, not erosive. Good represents the largest subcategory of good with an estimated 15 million U.S. adults diagnosed and treated for the disease annually. If approved, this indication will significantly broaden the quickness addressable population and we believe further accelerate uptake. Thorough review of the application is proceeding as expected, and we continue to plan for July launch in a sizable indication as for further development. We anticipate initiating a Phase three trial for as needed, nor are so good and a Phase two trial for eosinophilic esophagitis later this year. We believe the not present unique MOA bodes well for success in these two trials. If approved, these additional label extensions will further differentiate but not present relative to PPI.s and continue to expand the total addressable market for the credit and the products. We're excited about these programs and anticipate sharing more information about our progress in the future. Later in the call. Molly will further detail our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financials for which we reported revenues of $682,000 and ended the year with $381 million in cash. Overall, we believe our strong balance sheet will enable us to continue delivering on our launch and development strategy. I've previously stressed several foundational dynamics that are necessary for a potential blockbuster drug. These included a significant addressable market, clear unmet need among patients demonstrated superiority and physician demand. The qualitative feedback from these early months of launch has bolstered our belief that these elements are present in the good market. It now comes down to us executing on our strategy, and this team is poised to deliver. These are exciting times at time as we continue to make progress on both the commercial and development fronts this year is sure to be filled with new milestones and will set the foundation for the future of the Quinsa, our pursuit of becoming the number one prescribed and the person in the US is off to a strong start. And we remain steadfast in delivering on our strategy of driving blockbuster potential through continued market expansion. I will now turn the call over to Martin to dive deeper into our launch progress. Mattson?"", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Thanks, Terry, and hello, everyone. I'd like to first echo Terry's comments that we're very happy with how the launch of a question I have started. We're progressing as anticipated, and our prelaunch research is being validated by the feedback we're hearing from physicians and patients during today's call, I'll touch on both quantitative and qualitative elements from our launch, but I know many of you on this call are most keen to hear about our script data. So let's start there today. We're reporting script data as of February 23rd from both the QBO AmpLink Rx, which represents our latest available information with the second half of our sales force entering the field in early January. This reflects about seven weeks of our full promotional efforts. This has translated to achieving over 38 hundred filled prescriptions, which have reach patients' hands. As our reps continue to promote to physicians and garner the backing of strengthened commercial coverage. We expect positive script momentum to continue. Additionally, our KPI.s indicate that over 1,200 unique prescribers have written of a question of scripts that has ultimately been filled among those writers. We are already seeing repeat prescribing, which builds our confidence that physicians recognize with business value for patients. We are encouraged by the initial breadth of this prescriber base and anticipate it will grow as we further engage with high volume targets. Another important metric that Terry mentioned was total demand. We estimate that upwards of 14,000 prescriptions have been written since the start of launch, we believe the significant amount of demand to be indicative of the high level of unmet need in the market and demonstrates that patients are interested in trying something new and physicians are willing to wait for questions. As you've heard us say, historically, providing access to patients is key to converting demand as with all new products, negotiating coverage with payers as an essential step in achieving a successful launch, and this process often takes time in anticipation, we established a patient support program, SuperLink Rx, which has meaningfully expanded patient access, resulting in an increased number of filled scripts. Early data shows the use of Blink Rx growing consistently accompanied by positive feedback. However, there are still physicians sending scripts to their patients. Long-established retail pharmacies. Although this has led to a proportion of earlier question, the prescriptions not being filled, we believe we are well positioned to convert more of these scripts over time in the near term, our sales force continues to emphasize the availability of Blink Rx to physicians as it often represents the best option for getting the question that into patients' hands and ultimately future contracting with PBMs and health plans will increase payer access and narrow the gap between total demand and fill scripts. In fact, we'd have a question now on formulary at the first of the three major PBMs. We are already making progress on that front. First major PBM contracting with Express Scripts often referred to as ESI. about three weeks ago, we announced the positioning of Aquasana on ESI's national formulary. This was a key accomplishment for Fathom expanding requests as availability to roughly 23 million additional commercial lives. Our team was able to secure a nonpreferred brand status with a single step edit exactly as intended. Single step is with respect to use of generic PPI prescriptions within the last 130 days. These criteria will be evaluated at the pharmacy counter electronically, avoiding any administrative burden for physician or office staff. Alternatively, if a patient use over the counter PPI.'s instead of prescriptions during that time period. I think it also satisfies a single step by means of a prior authorization with attestation by their doctor. This latter avenue for access is a significant development as it means ESI patients could potentially access request as a first line treatment as intended. This formulary position provides physicians a straightforward path to accessing book business for the broadest patient population for questions. Total commercial coverage now reflects an estimated 60 million commercial covered lives. Achieving this level of commercial access less than three months into product availability is fantastic, but we know there is still work to be done. We believe our progress so far bodes well for our other ongoing negotiations where we remain focused on securing frequency coverage with similar formulary position. We are confident in our strategy and believe it will continue to yield expanded coverage, resulting in an uptick in filled prescriptions throughout the remainder of 2024. Shifting to our promotional efforts. The sales reps continue to report back that the question is generating enthusiasm with prescribers, physicians articulating patients' unmet need and recognizing for Quest, this value as a treatment option. The reps are focused on their reach and frequency among our full call panel of approximately 52,000 targets. In parallel, we are working diligently to reach patients suffering from the conditions for which the question is approved in these early days, we are happy to see that we appear to be making an impact to date. We've had over 185,000 visits to our consumer website, and we're hearing from physicians offices that patients are asking about for questioner. Patient requests are a key component of our demand strategy and market research conducted with 200 of our target physicians, almost 80% stated, they were graphic questions upon request for their erosive bird patients. With this in mind, we plan to initiate a new branded consumer campaign, which has been met with positive and motivating feedback from test audiences. This campaign speaks directly to erosive current patients and their symptoms. Most notably, this will include TV commercials and popular streaming services. So if you suffer from erosive guard, keep an eye out for a request to ads on your devices starting later this month and closing, I'm extremely happy with the commentary we're hearing from prescribers and how it translates into demand. We are successfully executing our launch strategy with continued promotion of physicians, a broadened consumer campaign and expanded commercial coverage. We anticipate significant growth in filled prescriptions over the course of 2020 for our teams are energized and committed to our belief in the blockbuster potential for requests. I'll now pass it off to Molly to walk through our financial results. Molly?"", 'Molly Henderson', ""Thank you, Martin, and hello to everyone on the call. I'm happy to share our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results with you today is a momentous earnings call for Fathom as it is the first time we are reporting net revenues for our requires new products. Other revenues reflect about a month of launch activity. We are pleased with the initial results. I'd like to note two items before going into the numbers. First, during this call, we will not be providing financial guidance regarding projected annual revenues spend or earnings as we are still early months of launch. Additionally, I will be commenting on both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, supporting schedules with detailed reconciliations between non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable GAAP measures will be discussed later in my section and can be found in this morning's press release. Now turning to the numbers for the fourth quarter 2023, we reported net revenues of $682,000, driven by the initial stocking of wholesalers in December. This reflects a partial quarter of sales, given that a question of bottles became commercially available as of November 28th and request and Apax as of mid-December. Additionally, we reported gross profit of $515,000 for the fourth quarter 2023, which equates to a gross margin of approximately 76% cost of revenues includes royalties owed to Takeda and exclude certain inventory costs which were expensed prior to receiving FDA approval. Note that the royalties owed as part of our revenue interest financing agreement are not captured in cost of revenues, but rather in other interest expense. Moving down the P&L to our spend, we reported non-GAAP R&D expenses of $6.1 million for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $14.3 million for the same period in 2022. As for SG&A, we reported non-GAAP expenses of $39.7 million for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $25.7 million for the fourth quarter 2022. On a full year basis, we reported non-GAAP R&D expenses of $37.6 million for 2023 compared to $65.9 million for 2022. And for SG&A, our non-GAAP expense was $85.2 million for 2023 compared to $82.4 million for 2022 on a full year. In quarterly basis, the decrease in R&D expenses was primarily related to lower clinical trial costs as we concluded our Phase three non erosive guard daily dosing trial during 2023. Regarding SG&A, our increase in spend was driven by the build-out of our commercial infrastructure and initiation of marketing activities in support of the commercial launch of a questioner. Additionally, the most significant reconciling item between GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx expenses for the period was noncash stock-based compensation, largely associated with the vesting of performance shares upon the approval of erosive Gertz. Other non-GAAP reconciling items include non-cash interest on our revenue, interest financing liability and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount. Turning to EPS, we reported GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter 2023 of $79.6 million or $1.39 loss per share, compared to $55 million or $1.33 loss per share for the fourth quarter 2022. Non-gaap adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter for 2023 was $46 million or $0.80 loss per share compared to $42.2 million or $1.2 loss per share for the same period in 2022. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $381 million. This includes $175 million received during the fourth quarter of 2023 from our revenue interest financing agreement upon the approval of Rose Garden. Also during the fourth quarter, we announced the expansion of our existing term loan facility with Hercules Capital. The amendment provides access to more favorable terms and an additional $100 million in non-dilutive capital subject to achievement of certain revenue milestones. With this amendment, we now have a total of $160 million available via our debt facility. We believe we are in a solid financial position and reaffirm our expectation that we have cash runway through the end of 2026. Based on our current operating plan, expected product revenues and funds available under our term loan. Lastly, as we shared previously, we expect nominal revenues during these first couple of quarters of launch, while payer coverage is materializing. Additionally, I mentioned our fourth quarter 2023 revenues mostly represented inventory stocking by wholesalers. We expect to sell through of the stocking to take place during the first quarter of 2020 for reinforcing our previous comments regarding nominal revenues during these first couple of quarters of launch. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Terry for closing comments. Terry?"", 'Terrie Curran', ""Thank you, Molly, and thank you again to everyone joining us on today's call. Adam's accomplishments in 2023 with nothing short of amazing, and I'm extremely proud of this team as we round at Q. one and approach Q2, our primary focus has been on securing formulary placement with payers. We've made great progress on that front so far and anticipate expanded commercial coverage throughout the year. As for the back half of 2024, we believe the planned launch of noninvasive good daily dosing in July, pending FDA approval will serve as another key catalyst for driving adoption. We believe acquisitive represents a blockbuster opportunity, and this flow launch is off to an exciting start. The enthusiasm here at A.D.A.M. is tremendous, and there is much to look forward to in 2024. Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest and support. I'll now turn it over to the operator to facilitate a 10 minute question and answer session. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. Withdraw your question, please press star one one again, one moment while we compile our Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Yatin Suneja', 'Okay. Thank you for thank you for taking my question. A couple of a couple for me. Could you just talk about the reason for not filling the script other than the coverage and how long does it takes for blank on Rx to get a blank on patients? Forget get the coverage Yes.', 'Martin Gilligan', ""So Yatin, this is Martin. I'll take that question. So in terms of the coverage, you know, I'll just reiterate how happy we are with the Express Scripts win from as we've talked about in the past, our objective was to get one step through IPPI., which opens up the broadest market. And I think the additional thing here that we walked away with is that if a patient has only been in an OTC, the physician can do it attestation and then they should have access to the plasma. So we anticipate that since it was just announced and just became available, we'll start to see an increase in the number of scripts that are getting through the system. And then we would also envision that given this win and it seems to fit with our strategy, we're very far along in negotiations with other major payers. So we would start to see that coming on board probably during as we enter into Q2 and then going into on the rest of the year. The other thing I'll just say is what we've actually been able to do is in terms of supporting that is with Blinkx Rx. I think you heard me mention that a couple of times, our goal there was really to make sure that first of all customers had a good experience. We wanted to address the lack of coverage early on. We also wanted to make sure that commercial patients and the question I got on the question as a physician intended. And then the other thing that was really important to us was that the program that we set up, that the refills were realized that once a patient converted from patient support over to commercial coverage that went through normal channels."", 'Yatin Suneja', ""Got it. And then just maybe a follow-up and really quick one. I understand you are in the early phase of launch and not providing sort of guidance, but could you just talk about your comfort with the consensus out there, which is around $40 million , $45 million and then also if you can talk about the GTN. dynamics where we are and how do you think it's going to evolve? And where do you expect to end up in 2024."", 'Molly Henderson', ""So hi, Yatin. I'll take that. It's Molly. And so overall, as you said, we're not providing specific guidance as it relates to our revenues other than reinforcing our previous commentary that we expect very nominal revenues for the first couple of quarters of launch as we're building payer coverage and working through the stocking that we that I alluded to in Q4. As it relates to GTN, we are not commenting necessarily on where we are. We are based upon the discussions we have ongoing with the payers and but what we have said previously, and we'll continue to provide some frame of guidance around just the run rate from. And what we've said is that we expect to between 50% and 65% on a normalized basis about from a steady state. So and those are the only pieces that we're providing guidance at this point as we're still early in the launch Thank you."", 'Operator', 'And one moment as we move on to our next call, Ken. And our next question is going to come from the line of Joseph Joseph Stringer with Needham & Company. Your line is Ben. Please go ahead.', 'Joseph Stringer', ""Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions of gave some very helpful in filling the contribution to FieldScripts from Blinkx Rx since launch but just curious if you can comment on the relative proportion so that Blinkx IQVS. split, was it higher or lower in 4Q '23 than what it is in the first quarter of this year to date? And maybe as a follow-up to that, can you provide any qualitative guidance on how you see that relative split trending as the launch goes on, in course, more coverages. Curious, would you expect that to trend down and reached a steady-state level at some point?"", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes, good morning, Tom. Good morning, Joey. So I'll take the first part of your question, I think there were there were two parts there. Yes. So what we see is that the utilization of Blink Rx is growing over time which is exactly what we intended and we communicated to you all and are strongly communicating to physicians that it's the best opportunity for ensure patient gets access to both plasma. So you wouldn't you would assume that since the launch that continues both in 2023 up until this point because the utilization of Blink Rx grows? I do just want to clarify that though, for you an important point in terms of the filled scripts. So as you take a look and you think about the scripts that you're seeing in the QBO does were actually filled at retail or anything else that we're saying above and beyond. That was actually part of the fills out took place at link Rx. So we would envision to the second part of your question is that that's split will remain consistent and then we'll start to change and shift more over to retail as we get more wins in Great."", 'Joseph Stringer', 'Thanks so much for the color.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next call, Ken, and our next question is going to come from the line of Paul Choi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Paul Choi', ""Great. Thank you and good morning, everyone. I just wanted to maybe follow up a little bit on the previous question with regard to the pace of conversion between Blinkx and FieldScripts and so forth. I'm just I guess, as you think about that ratio over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. You do all that expected to evolve more more linearly? Or do you sort of see step function changes as coverages as added here, including like wins such as the recent Express Scripts add? And then I had a pipeline question."", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes. So Paul, I'll take that question again. So I think that you'll see that change over time based on access. So early on in the very early weeks of launch, obviously, we had no access. So what went into Blinkx was clearly filled from a patient. They received a prescription and they used our patient support program going forward as we have more access and there's more in wins with payers with no scripts come in, they'll be immediately identified as having a commercial coverage and will be filled at retail."", 'Paul Choi', ""Okay, got it. And then a pipeline question on the EUV program is really interesting. I noticed in the press release you guys referenced PPIS. off-label or unapproved treatments. But I'm just curious how you're thinking about the study population, particularly in the recent light of budesonide being being approved for that population as well as our Dupixent. And so I'm just curious, are you thinking about this study as a treatment naive population or post steroid post biologic population as your initial U.S. study study population and maybe subsequent studies and other populations down down the road. Thank you very much, Paul."", 'Terrie Curran', ""Thanks for the question. I'll kick it off and then I'll pass over to Anthony. So we're finalizing the protocol for that. If we can sort of guide us as Phase two, we're really excited about that. And as you know, PPI.'s utilized first line, but another approved and stopped positioning in the treatment paradigm would be pre-biologic first line, um, as and so that's what we're pursuing there. And we intend to initiate that Phase two by year end, but maybe as maybe you have any other comments."", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes. I mean, we're definitely targeting first-line. We're looking at the broader population because remember, this is a Phase two. So we need to understand the performance in different population segments, but the intent is to be first line. Prebiologic patients will start with a similar treatment. Hopefully, we'll be able to show it's effective."", 'Paul Choi', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Umer Raffat', 'Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple here, if I may. First, could you remind us there was some confusion on whether the uptake in IMS especially was observed in January. And was that a function of IMS just doing a better job capturing Blinkx? Or was that completely exclusive, maybe a different way of answering that is the significant sort of acceleration we saw almost tripling in TRx heading into January February. Was that also seen in the prescriptions to date you guys saw and I have a couple of follow-ups.', 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes, good morning number. So I think what your question was specifically asking about the IQVIA data and any anything uptake or anything else in January. What that is any script that has gone through a retail channel is being picked up by QBO. So that's all scripts realized through normal retail channels it's all good."", 'Umer Raffat', 'But I guess my just to clarify, the acceleration seen in prescription pickup, which is over a doubling of TRx, was that something also observed in the prescription fill rate you guys are seeing as well of the overall prescriptions?', 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes. Yes, we're seeing that. We're seeing the same patterns, um, between blink and anything that's filled by blink and anything that's filled by the QBO. But what you're seeing on a weekly basis through a QBO are all scripts that are filled on through retail means."", 'Umer Raffat', ""Okay, got it. That's great. Now the next one is really around some of the stuff, the data points you guys here. So we know by IQVIA, the total prescriptions reported so far are just under 2000 or so, and you guys implied 38 hundred have been filled. So it's reasonable to assume that the IQVIA to Blinkx ratio is about one to one right now is that reasonable?"", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes, I think I think it's a pretty a pretty good assumption number."", 'Umer Raffat', 'Got it. And I guess the last point would be how do you think about how do you think about the prescriptions being filled up. Is that because of some payment issue? Because presumably through Blinkx, people are able to pay $50 or $75 and get it. So why would there be 10,000 or so prescriptions not picked up?', 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes. So um, you know, physicians have obviously when they're writing a prescription, have the ability to send it anywhere and that's a really important point that presence available at all retail pharmacies on Blinkx overall is a new service we are creating change. At the same time, what we're seeing is utilization growing of bling. We're seeing on a weekly demand on growing it linked, meaning there's new physicians coming in and there's repeat physicians coming in. So we would expect over time as more physicians start to use Blinkx, you might see that gap start to narrow simultaneously. As we have more wins, the gap is also going to narrow. So there's, you know, we're in the early weeks of the launch tumor. So there's a lot of variation there. We're seeing in the midst of a launch and then a very positive side, we'll see more variation and things such as this going forward."", 'Umer Raffat', 'Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.', 'Martin Gilligan', 'Welcome,', 'Operator', 'and thank you in one moment as we move on to our next call. Yes, and our next question is going to come from the line of Matthew Caulfield with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Matthew Caufield', 'Great. Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the launch progress. So based on the current erosive labeling, do you have a sense of whether any non erosive patients or patients that are possibly unconfirmed if their disease is erosive or non erosive are included in the current script launch numbers, either QQQ via equity via the TVL. were of the Blinkx Rx numbers.', 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes, thanks for the question of you know right now, well, it's not even right now. We're not tracking by indication. But I guess what I should make really clear is we're also not promoting for non erosive And so at the same time, we're not measuring any not erosive utilization."", 'Matthew Caufield', ""Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. So with the range of the 14 K. scripts written to date and the 3,800 plus that were filled on, is that spread at least at this stage in line with what you would have expected for this part of launch yes, just to clarify, just say nationwide."", 'Martin Gilligan', 'Yes, yes.', 'Matthew Caufield', 'Yes.', 'Martin Gilligan', ""No, we're seeing we're seeing some uptick, similar uptake similar across the US. We're not seeing differences by area of the country regions. And so we have the representatives are calling on 52,000 physicians, and they're all getting very similar positive feedback receptivity. And we're seeing uptake across all of the all of the different targets that we're calling out. And we're really pleased with the demand when we see 14,000 scripts from. And as I mentioned earlier, or I should say, written scripts when as I mentioned earlier, that we only had our full sales force in place only seven weeks ago. It really shows that the unmet need is there. We're hearing feedback from physicians that they're seeing patients already who were quickly within hours of healing healing results that happened in a very short period of time."", 'Matthew Caufield', 'Okay, great. Thank you. And congrats on the progress.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Chase Knickerbocker with Craig Hallum. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Chase Knickerbocker', ""Good morning, everyone. Yes, obviously, great to see with the ESI win. And I guess, Martin, what's your confidence level in kind of recreating the structure there, particularly around how the PA structured pretty simple PA process. If it's a simple, you know, automated poll, if they were on our XPPI.'s the last six months or so. And then simple attestation on the OTCPPS., is that something that you think you can recreate kind of broadly in all your contracts?"", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes. So the answer Chase um, I would say that the confidence that Scripps will go through for Express Scripts' national formulary is we're absolutely confident of that. What I'll also say is and I believe Terry mentioned this in our opening remarks, and we've really progressed with the large payers in terms of getting access for of Aquasana. And all of those discussions are centered around the same strategy as one step through on the PPI. and I think as we've always spoke about before, is that is the largest segment, given that the majority of patients are already on a CPI. and there's a lot of switching from one PPI. to another. There's a lot of OTC add-on. So we see that this is a and we really were successful in getting the broadest population possible,"", 'Chase Knickerbocker', ""but then particularly around that kind of the PA, the structure of the PA there and how it functions. That's something that you think you can recreate on the other large formularies? And then yes, also, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the characteristics of the early writers. So far are they largely GI docs, you know, should we think of them as higher volume? Obviously, it's just a couple scripts filled per prescriber today. Just some color there would be helpful."", 'Martin Gilligan', ""Yes. So I'll take the first part of the question in terms of the OTCPA. associated with that.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.70 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.4%.

They are among the biggest marketing giants on the planet, for one, and boast global businesses with extremely valuable brands. And both underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2023, making them good candidates for investors who are seeking value."", ""But which is the better addition to your portfolio right now? Let's dive right in."", ""These aren't boom times for either the beverage industry or the footwear market, and that fact helps explain why Wall Street has left both stocks out of the latest bull market rally. Coke shares are flat in the past year and Nike is down 16% even as the S&P 500 has jumped 27%."", ""Coke's relative outperformance reflects its stronger growth profile. Organic sales were up a healthy 12% in 2023, management announced in mid-February. Compare that to Nike's most recent 1% decline and there's a clear growth winner today. Coke's momentum is likely to carry on into 2024, with organic sales on track to stay in solidly positive territory. Nike, on the other hand, has warned investors to expect even weaker sales trends over the next six months."", ""Nike is making aggressive moves aimed at boosting profitability, yet you'll still prefer Coke for its sparkling earnings outlook. The beverage giant showed off its pricing power this past year, boosting prices while keeping case volume rising in 2023. That's a great sign for the next few quarters of profits."", 'Nike, in contrast, endured declining earnings in the past six months as many of its retailing partners cut prices to keep inventory moving. Nike expects these tough industry conditions to continue at least through the rest of fiscal 2025, with sales trends likely weakening even further.', 'Watch for financial benefits from its new cost-cutting program, but don\'t expect an especially sharp rebound. ""As we look ahead to a softer second-half revenue outlook, we remain focused on strong gross profit margin execution and disciplined cost management,"" Nike CFO Matthew Friend said in late-December earnings report.', ""As you might expect, Coke's excellent finances make it a more attractive stock when it comes to cash returns. You'll get a 3%-plus yield with the beverage giant's shares, or about twice Nike's yield. Coke also has a much longer track record of raising its payout (over 60 years compared to Nike's 22 years). That's a direct result of the company's dominant market position in the consumer staples industry. If you prefer stable sales and earnings growth, then Coke will be a better fit for you."", ""Coke seems like the cheaper stock at first glance, which might seem surprising given its better operating metrics. Shares are priced at 24 times earnings compared to Nike's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30. In this case, the price-to-sales ratio makes more sense as a valuation metric given all the volatility around currency exchange rate swings. Coke is trading at a premium there, both compared to Nike and to its rival PepsiCo."", ""Most investors will still prefer Coca-Cola stock even at its higher valuation. The company has attractive growth prospects in non-traditional beverage niches like energy drinks and sparkling waters. And its ample profits point to rising cash returns ahead. Meanwhile, Nike has been struggling for years to get to a place of sustainably stronger earnings.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

The rally was supported by investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts in 2024 as the Federal Reserve’s battle to control inflation seems to be bearing fruit. Recently, Goldman Sachs lifted its S&P 500 index year-end target to 5200 which represents further 4% growth for the Index based on current levels.

By and large, most things you can buy from one, you can also buy from the other. Target's (NYSE: TGT) recently reported fourth-quarter numbers, however, are a reminder of why Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is the better investment of the two options right now."", 'The market overwhelmingly disagrees with my argument, by the way. Target shares soared to the tune of 12% on Tuesday following the release of its Q4 results.', 'The company handily topped earnings estimates of $2.42 per share by posting a profit of $2.98, well up from the year-ago comparison of $1.89 per share. Margins were better too. Target also unveiled several new growth initiatives, including a subscription-based same-day delivery program. Guidance for the fiscal year that began in February is in line with estimates as well.', 'Now take a closer look at the numbers. Although ""comparable sales and traffic trends improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row,"" they only improved by virtue of being less bad. Same-store sales still slipped 5.4% during the three-month stretch ending in January, and that was with an extra week\'s worth of selling! Total revenue of $31.9 billion was only up 1.7% year over year, with new stores driving more than all of that net growth.', ""The biggest piece of Target's net income growth of $506 million came from a $543 million reduction in the costs of goods sold -- a benefit that the retailer didn't necessarily create itself. Its selling and administrative costs grew 6.3% from $5.6 billion to $6 billion, outpacing sales growth by a country mile."", ""It's not all bad, to be fair. The company's biggest headache from just a few quarters ago -- way too much inventory -- no longer appears to be a costly problem. Inventory levels fell from $13.5 billion a year ago to only $11.9 billion as of the beginning of February, not forcing Target to take the profit-pinching markdowns it suffered for much of 2023. It's also anticipating measurable comparable sales growth in 2024."", ""None of these numbers, however, hold a candle to Walmart's. Its company-wide revenue improved 5.7% (4.9% on a constant currency basis) during its comparable holiday quarter. Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 4%. Gross profits grew from 22.9% of sales to 23.3% of sales during the three-month stretch ended in January, while adjusted per-share profits moved from $1.71 in the last fiscal quarter of 2022 to $1.80 per share this time around."", ""In some ways, these results are better than Target's. In other ways, they're worse. The ways in which they're worse, however, tend to be the more important ones for retailers. Take sales as an example. If nothing else, selling the goods currently sitting on store shelves frees up room and money to buy more marketable goods, even if margins on the merchandise going out the door right now aren't particularly high."", ""At the very least, Walmart is getting inventory from its warehouses onto its stores' shelves and then into customers' hands. It may not be making a whole lot more, but in the world of retailing, every penny is important."", ""The company isn't spending a ton more money to do it, either. Although Walmart's selling and administrative expenses did edge higher during the quarter ending in January, that 3.8% increase is measurably less than the 5.7% increase in its top line. Those figures are reflective of the full-year numbers too."", ""The kicker: Walmart is expecting top-line growth of between 3% and 4% this year, roughly doubling Target's own outlook."", ""Why is Target struggling to do what Walmart seems to be able to do with ease? There are a couple of arguable reasons. The first of these is consumers' perception of Target. The two retailers certainly have their similarities. They're not the same, though. Target has successfully branded itself as a place for people to spend their discretionary dollars."", ""By contrast, Walmart remains a place to find value. Since lingering inflation and economic uncertainty are weighing on people's minds right now, more of them are opting to visit a Walmart. Indeed, Walmart has consistently highlighted the fact that most of last year's market share gains came from households with annual incomes of more than $100,000. That used to be Target's bread and butter."", ""The other reason Walmart is winning while Target isn't? Size. Walmart's just got more of it -- and it's using it. With over 5,000 stores in the U.S. alone versus Target's less than 2,000 (not to mention that Walmart is also the U.S.'s biggest grocery store chain), Walmart enjoys considerably more leverage that it's not afraid to apply."", 'Early last year, for instance, Walmart flatly told several of its packaged-food suppliers it would no longer digest price increases, threatening to more prominently feature its own private-label goods without price relief. Then it used its size and in-house know-how to help these brands lower their wholesale costs.', ""It's also worth asking whether Target overreacted to last year's inventory growth debacle, culling so much of it between then and now that it doesn't have enough of the right merchandise on its shelves. Never say never."", ""This divergence between these two similar companies won't be this pronounced forever. The economy will eventually find itself on a firmer footing, favoring Target's discretionary schtick. Walmart will eventually slip as well, perhaps becoming a victim of its own size and complexity."", ""Such a shift isn't on the near-term radar, however. Inflation rates are still above the Federal Reserve's target levels, and the Fed is seemingly losing interest in previously expected interest rate cuts toward the middle of this year. In the meantime, job layoffs are accelerating again, while credit card debt among U.S. residents stood at a record high of $1.13 trillion as of the end of 2023, according to numbers from the Federal Reserve. The yield curve remains inverted as well."", ""These aren't the sorts of challenges that simply fade away in a matter of weeks. It could take months -- if not years -- to shrug them off. People will be thinking, acting, and spending cautiously until that happens. Walmart stock remains the better bet in the meantime."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting in person with us. And of course, we're happy that many, many more of you are attending the meeting remotely. Brian's going to kick off the meeting in a minute, but first I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations and SEC filings, which are posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to get things started."", ""Brian Cornell: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to providing our perspective on the results we shared this morning, and I can't wait for you to hear from several of our top leaders, including Christina Hennington, Rick Gomez, Jill Sando, Cara Sylvester, and Michael Fiddelke. While Michael still has his hands firmly on the wheel as CFO, this is his first FCM in his new role as our Chief Operating Officer. I can tell you; we're looking forward to discussing Target's growth horizon and how it transcends volatility over any particular quarter or year. Our preference is always to think long term. It's why for years now, we've emphasized the durability of our business model. And many of you have validated that orientation in the conversations we've had with you over the years."", ""So, our session today will focus squarely on the long-term thinking that has driven top and bottom-line growth over the last decade and positions us for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. You might be asking, why focus on decades? In part, because that feels like a long enough time frame to be meaningful. But it's also because we look at longer horizons when evaluating growth potential for investments, like new stores, supply chain, and other assets. And it's good to ask, what else would need to be true for those investments to succeed? So, we'll analyze our 2023 performance in that context. We'll provide insights on how our 2024 plans and guidance fit into that vision and we'll spend time outlining our plan for sustained growth as well as our capacity to react to unforeseen realities."", ""Both have been important over the last 10 years. By designing for steady growth before 2020, we were positioned to absorb exponential growth during a demand boom that none of us could have anticipated. Even now, the country and the retail industry are in a prolonged post pandemic return to normal, which has been nearly as unpredictable as the pandemic itself from a consumer, social, political and economic perspective. By staying agile as a team, and by continuously refining our approach and innovating, we've been able to navigate this time frame. In fact, if you think back to our earlier algorithms and long-range plans, we're well ahead of where we believe we'd be just a few short years ago. At the same time, we recognize this is a unique moment to clarify our road map for growth."", ""Let me be really clear. Our goal is to recapture profitable sales, traffic, and market share gains by expanding what makes Target different and better for our guests, amplifying our appeal to consumers beyond our existing guest base, and reinforcing the innovation and investment that drive durable and consistent results for our business and shareholders. So, I might start today with the elements of the overall strategy that have been staples all along, and will continue to be staples going forward. Starting with our stores, the most visible and tangible proof of our long-term planning and investment. When I arrived at Target, we had just over 1800 stores that didn't quite cover all 50 states. Since then, we built more than 200 new stores. We've invested in more than 1200 existing locations through remodels and partnerships and our store footprint has expanded to cover the entire U.S. While retail is decades in the new digital era, on any given day 2/3 to 3/4 of all U.S. shopping is still done in stores."", 'See also 12 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks To Buy According To Analysts and 25 Best Places to Travel in the World in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

During this period, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, which Royal Caribbean falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $1.30 per share, indicating a change of +665.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.9% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $10.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +47.9%. This estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.73 indicates a change of +17.2% from what Royal Caribbean is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.8%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Royal Caribbean, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.64 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +26.3%.

We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2023 performance followed by our outlook for 2024. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with fourth quarter sales and earnings results that were well ahead of our expectations. Our above planned sales were driven by our customers' positive response to the improved assortments of quality branded bargains throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the 14-weeks ended February 3, 2024, were $1.82 up from $1.31 per share for the 13-weeks ended January 28, 2023."", 'Net income for the period rose to $610 million versus $447 million last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew to $6 billion driven by robust comparable store sales gain of 7%. For the 2023 fiscal year, earnings per share were $5.56 up from $4.38 for the 52-weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the fiscal 2023 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. Total sales for the year increased to $20.4 billion up from $18.7 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales for the 52-week ended January 27, 2024 grew a solid 5%. As noted in our press release, the sales results for both the 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal year included a $308 million benefit from the 53 week. Earnings per share for both periods also benefited from the extra week by approximately $0.20 per share.', ""Fourth quarter operating margin grew 165 basis points to 12.4%, up from 10.7% in 2022. This improvement was mainly due to the strong gains in same-store sales and lower freight costs that were partially offset by higher incentives. The 53-week also benefited operating margin by 80 basis points. Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, cosmetics, home and children's were the best performing merchandise areas, while geographic results were broad based, dd's discount sales trends slightly trailed Ross' growth. While dd's top line results were respectable in fiscal 2023, we are disappointed with the performance in newer markets. We are currently conducting an in-depth analysis of dd's to better understand and address the different wants and needs of their diverse customer base, particularly as we expand outside our current existing geographies."", ""Until this work is completed, we believe it is wise over the near-term to moderate dd’s store growth in newer markets and focus new store openings primarily in existing regions. Now let's turn to inventory. As we ended the quarter and the year, consolidated inventories were up 8%. Average store inventories were up 9% compared to 2022's holiday period, due primarily to the 53rd week shift. Packaway represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. Regarding our store expansion program, we added 94 net new stores in 2023, including 71 Ross Stores, Ross Dress for Less and 23 dd's discounts. We ended 2023 with 2,109 stores, including 1,764 Ross Dress for Less and 345 dd's discount locations. As we noted in today's release, for the fourth quarter fiscal 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million and 8.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $247 million in the quarter $950 million for the fiscal year."", 'These purchases were made pursuant to the 2 year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022, which we have now completed as planned. Our Board of Directors also recently approved a new 2 year $2.1 billion stock repurchase authorization or approximately $1.05 billion for each fiscal year. This new plan represents an 11% increase over the recently completed repurchase program. In addition, the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.3675 per share to be payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns given the strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of the business.', 'Now, Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2024.', ""Adam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose a strong 7% for the quarter, entirely driven by higher traffic and shoppers' positive response to our improved assortments throughout our stores. As Barbara noted earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% was up 165 basis points from 10.7% in 2022 and included about an 80 basis point benefit from the 53rd week in 2023. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales improved by 265 basis points versus last year benefiting from a combination of factors. Merchandise gross margin increased by 110 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Distribution costs declined by 75 basis points, partially driven by favorable timing of packaway related costs."", ""Domestic freight and occupancy costs levered by 75 45 basis points respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying costs that increased 40 basis points mainly from higher incentives. SG&A for the period delevered by 100 basis points mostly driven by higher incentive costs and wages. Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024. As mentioned in our press release, we are encouraged by the sustained sales momentum that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the holiday season. That said, there remains ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In addition while inflation is moderating price is per necessity by housing, food and gasoline remain elevated and continue to pressure the low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend."", 'While we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting our business in 2024. For the 52-weeks ending February 1, 2025, we are planning comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a solid 5% gain in 2023. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.89 compared to $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year compared to 53-weeks in 2023. As previously mentioned, our 2023 earnings per share benefited from an additional $0.20 of EPS from the extra week. Turning to our guidance assumptions for the 2024 year. Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 4% for the 52-weeks ending February 1, 2025 versus the 53-weeks ended February 3, 2024.', ""This year-over-year increase in total revenue is affected by last year's 53rd week, which added approximately $308 million to sales in the fourth quarter fiscal year of 2023. If same-store sales perform in line with our plan, operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% compared to 11.3% last year, which benefited by 25 basis points from the 53rd week. This year-over-year change also includes the benefit of anniversarying higher incentive costs in 2023 given our outperformance. In addition, for fiscal 2024, we expect merchandise margins to be pressured as we plan to offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. For 2024, we expect to open approximately 90 new locations comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's discounts."", ""These openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $143 million, depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $610 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $332 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2024 are planned to be approximately $840 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business. Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. We are planning comparable store sales for the 13-weeks ending May 4, 2024 to be up 2% to 3% versus a 1% gain in last year's first quarter."", ""If sales perform in line with this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 to be $1.29 to $1.35 versus $1.09 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are planned to be up 6% to 8% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 11.1% to 11.4% compared to 10.1% last year. The expected increase mainly reflects our forecast for lower incentives and freight costs that are partially offset by lower merchandise margin and higher wages. We plan to add 18 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 7 dd's discounts during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $44 million, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecasted to be about $335 million."", ""Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments."", ""Barbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. To sum up, as Adam noted, while we hope to do better than our forecast this year, the external environment remains uncertain, and our low- to moderate income customers' discretionary spend continues to be impacted by elevated cost of living. Despite these headwinds last year, our shoppers responded positively to the strong values we offered across our stores, which drove our better than expected sales and earnings growth throughout 2023. In 2024, we plan to build upon these efforts and offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. We believe the diligent execution of this plan will result in increased market share gains this year and in the future. At this point, we'd like to open the call and respond to any questions you may have."", 'See also 20 Biggest Oil Producers in the World and 20 Best Places to Live in Texas in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$278, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$263m.

With various cryptocurrencies heating up again, though, financial technologies’ long-term potential (like those on the blockchain) will be harder to ignore. Add a sprinkle of generative AI into the equation, and the leading financial technology firms — think V, MA, and NU — may be next to join the bullish ascent as growth-hungry investors look for lower-cost firms that can profit from AI.', 'Therefore, let’s check TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to gain a better gauge of the following Strong-Buy-rated fintech firms and the road ahead for an industry that stands to benefit greatly from AI’s next chapter.', 'Visa stock broke out in a big way in the fourth and final quarter of last year. So far, in 2024, the credit card king is showing no signs of slowing down, with 8% returns posted year-to-date. Though some may view Visa as an old-fashioned credit card firm, I’m more inclined to view it as a digital payments innovator.', 'Sure, Visa may not be as cutting-edge as some of its smaller peers, given its massive size and impressive credit card leadership position, which has naturally forced the firm to play defense. Regardless, Visa stock seems to be in a sweet spot for the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investors out there. For that reason, I remain bullish as Visa continues to embrace payment tech with open arms.', 'Indeed, as we’re propelled further into the AI age, Visa and other payment firms need to be vigilant, as it’s not only good-meaning entities that stand to benefit from generative AI. Cyber threats and various fraudsters can also harness the power of AI. As such, all big firms need to take a more proactive approach to protecting users from fraud.', 'Visa has been leveraging AI to detect fraud and manage risks for many decades before AI was a buzzword on Wall Street. As predictive AI becomes more capable, count on Visa to stay on the cutting edge as it seeks to stay many steps ahead of fraudulent actors.', 'Apart from fighting fraud with AI, look for Visa to keep putting cash toward its Generative AI Ventures fund. Yes, the credit card company has an AI fund, just like the mega-cap tech titans. This goes to show just how much skin in the game the firm has as it looks to defend its dominance in payments and fintech. At 29.1 times forward price-to-earnings, V stock is a fintech firm to continue watching closely.', 'Visa stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 22 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average V stock price target\xa0of $306.64 implies 9.9% upside potential.', 'Speaking of fighting fraud with AI, Mastercard is also a major player on the scene. Arguably, Mastercard has even more to gain from investing heavily in AI as it seeks to chase down the heavyweight champ Visa. Mastercard’s chief technology officer, Ed McLaughlin, recently sat down with Fortune in a chat centered around the company’s involvement with next-generation technologies, like AI.', '“The way the [AI] systems are working is always making predictions of what’s most likely to happen,” said McLaughlin. “And that’s why these generative [AI] techniques are so exciting, as they’re allowing us to make better predictions.”', 'Undoubtedly, Mastercard seems to be doing its best to stay ahead, perhaps far ahead, of bad actors who seek to use AI for evil. This alone is enough to make anyone bullish. As the company continues to perfect predictive AI, I expect it could prevent a swelling figure of fraud losses. Undoubtedly, AI-driven fraud management is a big deal when it comes to saving money in the never-ending battle against fraud.', 'At this juncture, I don’t think you could go wrong with Visa or Mastercard when it comes to AI-driven payment innovation. As it stands, however, I’m a bigger fan of MA stock, even at the pricier 32.2 times forward price-to-earnings multiple. The number-two credit card behemoth has room to catch up to Visa as it looks to aggressively invest in AI to go on the offensive.', 'Mastercard stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 29 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MA stock price target\xa0of $512.48 implies 9.4% upside potential.', 'Nu Holdings is a relative lightweight compared to Visa and Mastercard, with its mere $53.6 billion market cap. The Brazil-based digital bank has enjoyed exceptional growth as it expanded its financial services (think no-fee credit and debit cards) into emerging nations. I’ll admit, it was the bold investment made by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) a few years ago that put NU stock on my radar.', 'Though shares of NU represent a small portion of the Berkshire portfolio (around 0.3% as of the latest quarter), there’s no denying that Nu Holdings has many traits of a “wonderful” business.', 'And even though shares are scorching hot again, I can’t help but stay bullish on the company’s plans to bring new payment technologies to high-growth Latin American markets. High-growth technology meets high-growth emerging markets? That sounds like a formula for sustainably high growth rates to me.', 'In the latest fourth quarter, NU clocked in $2.4 billion in sales, up just north of 12% year-over-year. That’s not bad, given recent macro headwinds. The bigger headline, though, was that CEO David Velez noted Nu is “investing heavily in new growth avenues” to drive profit.', 'With sights set on “the 100 million customers milestone in 2024,” I find it hard to give up on the fintech darling. At 25.3 times forward price-to-earnings, NU stock seems like an even better bargain than Visa or Mastercard, as it aims to bring banking services to the masses.', 'NU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with three unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. Nonetheless, the\xa0average NU stock price target\xa0of $11.33 implies 1.05% downside potential.', 'The fintech scene is full of GARP-like plays these days as they seek to harness AI tech to bolster their moats. Of the trio, analysts see the most year-ahead upside from V stock, and that makes sense. Visa is the biggest and perhaps best value of the batch right now. The company’s tech savviness still seems discounted by many.', 'Disclosure']"

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Amphenol (APH), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Amphenol currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For APH, shares are up 3.11% over the past week while the Zacks Electronics - Connectors industry is up 1.84% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.99% compares favorably with the industry's 1.74% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Amphenol have risen 14.96%, and are up 39.36% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 12.57% and 27.72%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of APH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, APH is averaging 2,165,794 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well.

If you would like to skip our discussion on the impact of climate change on the European economy, you can go to the 5 Sunniest Cities in Europe.', ""The devastating effects of climate change and global warming were felt within Europe during the summer of 2023. Deadly floods in Greece, wildfires in Tenerife, and extreme heat in Southern Italy were all witnessed during that time. Climate change is also affecting the travel industry in Europe. A survey by the European Travel Commission revealed that 14% of the respondents found extreme weather events to be a primary concern, marking an increase from the 7% reported in a previous survey. This is especially concerning since the travel and tourism industry accounts for 10% of Europe's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Europe is home to some of the most visited destinations in the world. In fact, the continent accounts for 51% of all international arrivals as of 2019."", 'According to a study conducted by the Joint Research Center, climate change has the potential to shift tourism patterns within Europe. The projections within the study show that a rise in temperature by 3°C or 4°C will lead to a reduction in tourists by approximately 10% for the southern coastal regions, which include the sunniest countries in Europe. On the other hand, northern coastal regions will witness an increase of 5% in the aforementioned scenario. The study showed that the highest gains (more than 5%) should be witnessed by Germany, Finland, Denmark, France, Ireland, the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands. On the flip side, Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Italy, and Portugal shall experience the highest losses above 5% if temperatures rise.', ""Apart from the coasts and sunniest places in Europe, winter sports, Europe's iconic mountain ranges, and ski resorts would also have to face the effects of climatic change. Half of the ski resorts in Europe are at high risk of snow scarcity by 2100 if temperatures rise by 2°C, while 98% of the ski resorts will face the risk if the temperatures rise by 4°C. This threatens the winter sports industry, which generates about 10 billion euros per year and employs 1.5 million people annually across the continent during an average season. Cultural heritage, a cornerstone of European tourism, is also under threat."", ""Rising sea levels and coastal erosion endanger historical sites and landmarks. In Venice, Italy, iconic structures like St. Mark's Square are experiencing more frequent flooding events due to rising sea levels, with the city estimated to be completely underwater by 2100 if no action is taken. Thus, climate change not only damages the cultural heritage of Europe but also endangers a major attraction for tourists. Travel-related companies like Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR) stand to be significantly impacted by such changes."", ""Hence, there is a need for more sustainable and green practices within Europe's travel industry. Embracing sustainable practices like reducing energy and water consumption in hotels by 20% by 2030 (as set by the EU's Green Deal) and promoting eco-friendly transportation options like electric vehicles can significantly reduce the industry's environmental footprint. Responsible waste management, such as reducing single-use plastics by 50% by 2025 (as outlined in the EU's Single-Use Plastics Directive) and promoting responsible tourism practices among travelers, can further contribute to a more sustainable future."", 'Torgado/Shutterstock.com', 'For our list of 15 sunniest cities in Europe, we have ranked the cities in terms of average annual sunshine duration.

While many within the cohort have AI products, they aren\'t pure plays.', 'Instead, I\'m proposing a new group of three that informs investors on how strong AI demand is. That group, consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is also a member of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), gives investors a look at the hardware side of AI.', 'So, if you\'re looking for a basket of stocks to track AI infrastructure buildout, this ""Terrific Trio"" is the way to go.', ""Starting at the base, computing hardware requires semiconductor chips, and Taiwan Semiconductor produces the vast majority of them. To produce more powerful chips, manufacturers place the conductive traces closer together, which allows more components to be packed onto a board. To describe these chips, chip manufacturers name them based on how far apart the traces are. Currently, the smallest TSMC can go is 3 nanometers (nm), but it's already working on its 2 nm technology as well."", ""Taiwan Semiconductor makes chips for some of the world's biggest companies and is one of Nvidia's key suppliers."", ""Nvidia gets the most attention of this trio, as its parabolic rise since early 2023 resulted in the stock increasing nearly 500%. This excitement is due to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are best-in-class for training AI models. GPUs are built to process complex calculations like training AI models."", 'But what benefits Nvidia is the number of GPUs purchased when a supercomputer is built. These devices require thousands of GPUs to provide users with top-end computing power, and with the rumored price of an H100 GPU coming in at around $30,000 a piece, that generates a lot of revenue for Nvidia.', 'Lastly is Super Micro Computer. Haphazardly assembling a few hundred or thousand GPUs together without the networking or architecture experience is a recipe for disaster. Many companies without the experience necessary to get the most out of their GPUs go to Supermicro to build their servers.', ""With Super Micro Computer's highly modular system, it can spec in a server of just about any size and focus that a client could want."", ""Together, these three offer a great pulse on the AI movement, as their products are essential table stakes for getting into the AI game. But they've each had a strong 2024, so is this a good trio to buy right now?"", ""This group has been a fantastic one to own in 2024. Supermicro's led the charge, rising more than 280%."", 'After those numbers, many investors may be worried about overpaying for any of the stocks in this group. However, that argument breaks down if you examine the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (which uses analyst projections over the next 12 months).', ""The forward P/E ratio is important when the company you're assessing is going through a massive transformation, like these three are due to AI demand. Additionally, when comparing this metric to a more typical price-to-earnings ratio (which uses trailing earnings to value the company), it's best to take a few points off because these are only projections."", ""With that in mind, it's clear that Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are still within the realm of buying, although Supermicro has gotten quite expensive. However, Nvidia's stock also traded for more than 50 times forward earnings in 2023, so Supermicro could grow into its valuation through sustained outsize growth."", 'So, should you buy the ""Terrific Trio?"" I\'d say yes if you want an absolute pulse on the AI market.

This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Travelers Companies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.

The positive analyst coverage had helped send the artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price roughly 3.5% higher in the daily session as of this writing -- and the bullish news had spillover benefits for other top chip stocks. But Broadcom, Micron, and Intel are also enjoying their own company-specific valuation tailwinds today."", 'According to a report published by Bloomberg today, Intel is on track to score another big public-sector win. The report states that the U.S. government is poised to invest $3.5 billion in the company to aid the production of chips that will be used for military and intelligence purposes.', 'With concerns that China will soon move to exercise greater control over Taiwan, other world powers are trying to secure new sources for high-performance semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing accounts for roughly 60% of the global contract chip market -- and 90% of the market when it comes to the kinds of advanced chips used for AI and other accelerated-computing processes.', 'If China were to tighten its hold on Taiwan, it could result in major supply chain disruptions, urgent security issues, and dramatically negative impacts on the global economy. Due to these risks, the U.S. and other Western allies have been moving to ramp up alternative chip-production capabilities.', ""Intel has emerged as a leading beneficiary of this trend and looks poised to see chip fabrication for third-party customers become a driving force of new growth. Matching Taiwan Semiconductor's production capabilities will take years, even in optimistic scenarios. Still, it's increasingly clear that Intel will have major public-sector backing aiding its pursuits in the fab space."", 'In a note published before the market opened today, Stifel upgraded its rating on Micron Technology stock from hold to buy.

Between improving business results and a backdrop that will pave the way for the stock to see valuation-multiple expansion, the firm believes the stock has plenty of room to run.

Along with expectations for improving business in the near term, the firm expects that the improving long-term outlook will make investors willing to assign higher valuation multiples to the stock.', ""While the market will undoubtedly see some unexpected twists and turns, there's a lot to like about the long-view outlook for the semiconductor industry right now. In addition to positive catalysts stemming from the emergence of new AI technologies, it's a virtual certainty that chips will continue to play an increasingly important role in global economic activity and everyday life.

An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.6% and 3.6% of all recommendations.', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Fidelity National here>>>The ABR suggests buying Fidelity National, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in FIS?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Fidelity National, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 9.2% over the past month to $4.65.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Fidelity National.

Starbucks became a target for consumer boycotts protesting the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, after suing its union group for trademark infringement, after the union made a social post in October stating, “Solidarity with Palestine.” The layoffs mean that Starbucks’ growth prospects in the Middle East are slightly more bleak while the company continues facing consumer pressure among its U.S customers.', 'The boycotts are meant to protest the war in Gaza, ignited by the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. Israel’s response has been called an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe with a rising human cost: At least 17 children have starved to death and about 134 hostages remain in Gaza. President Joe Biden, widely criticized for supporting Israel, has lately called Israel’s response “over the top,” which he followed by calling for a temporary cease-fire. Biden recently announced plans to build a temporary port on Gaza’s coast to allow more humanitarian aid— which Israel has repeatedly obstructed, according to a report by Refugees International—to enter the strip.', 'The layoffs mean Starbucks’ growth prospects are “dimmer in the Middle East,” according to Diogenes Mejia, the director of S&P Global Ratings. It puts the coffee chain’s growth potential more in line with other fast-food giants, like McDonald’s and Yum Brands, that have become boycott targets, too.', 'But “what makes the impact to Starbucks unique” from other brands, he said, is that it has seen “some weakness in traffic among certain demographics in the United States,” one of the company’s most profitable markets.', '“To the extent that there’s contention and people boycotting in the U.S.,” Mejia said, it will have “a bigger impact on the company than if the same thing were to happen in the Middle East.”', 'Starbucks cited consumer boycotts as one reason for its slower than anticipated first-quarter sales, and also forecasted slower growth for the rest of the year. On an earnings call in January, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company saw “negative impact to our business in the Middle East” and that “events in the Middle East also had an impact in the U.S., driven by misperceptions about our position.” Rachel Ruggeri, Starbucks’ executive vice president, added she expects the conflicts will contribute to lower earnings in the second quarter of the year.', 'Because of the massive scale of the company, Mejia said, its international sales were still able to grow 7% in the first quarter. But the layoffs mean “whatever growth plans they had in the Middle East now become more complicated,” because “as a franchisee in that space, you always want to grow the number of stores you have. If you’re closing stores, that means your growth prospects are dimmer than maybe they were a year ago.”', 'Most of the company’s stores in the Middle East are licensed and-owned by Alshaya, which has owned the rights to operate the coffee shops since 1999. The group now runs over 1,900 stores in 11 Middle Eastern and North American markets and employs over 19,000 “green apron partners,” or Starbucks workers. The company’s 2,000 fired employees make up just a fraction of its entire workforce. Starbucks employs over 381,000 employees in 19,592 company-owned stores, and employs even more in its 18,446 licensed stores in the world. The U.S and China are two of Starbucks most promising markets for growth, where it operates 15,328 and 4,700 stores, respectively.', 'A Starbucks spokesperson said that the company’s “thoughts are with the green apron partners who will be leaving,” and that it will continue working closely with Alshaya “to drive long-term growth in this important region.”', 'McDonald’s, which became a boycott target after photos of a McDonald’s franchise in Israel donating thousands of free meals to soldiers went viral in October, reported a rare sales miss in its -fourth quarter earnings report in February, It cited declining sales in Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia.\xa0Yum Brands, the parent company of fast-food brands Taco Bell and KFC, came under fire for its investment in Israeli startups, like TicTuk, an Israeli company that allows customers to order food on social networks and message apps. On an earnings call, Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs said “top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The company’s properties are typically located in large, supply-constrained infill markets in proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation facilities, which facilitates the rapid distribution of customers’ products. The solid demand for Prologis’ strategically located facilities has driven healthy operating performance over the past few quarters.In the fourth quarter of 2023, 43.7 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 36.8 msf in the operating portfolio and 6.9 msf in the development portfolio. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio remained high at 97.1%. For 2024, management expects occupancy in the band of 96.50-97.50%. We estimate occupancy to be 97%. Also, our estimate points to a year-over-year increase of 9.6% in rental revenues in 2024.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Its investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million.In June 2023, it concluded the buyout of nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced Prologis’ presence in the key U.S. markets, poising it well for long-term growth.Moreover, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $733 million in 2023. Development stabilization aggregated $3.15 billion, while development starts totaled $3.4 billion. Prologis’ investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million. For 2024, the company anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $500 million and $1 billion, while development starts are expected in the range of $3-$3.5 billion.PLD maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample flexibility. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $6 billion as of Dec 31, 2023. The company's weighted average interest rate on its share of the total debt was 3%, with a weighted average term of 9.1 years. It has no significant debt maturities until 2026. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis is committed to that. In February 2024, the company’s board hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.3% to 96 cents per share from 87 cents paid earlier, taking the annualized dividend to $3.84 per share. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend six times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.33%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.Given the company’s solid operating platform, opportunities for growth, a decent financial position compared with the industry and our year-over-year growth projection of 6.8% in the first-quarter 2024 core FFO, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable over the near term.Shares of Prologis have rallied 11% over the past three months, outperforming the industry’s increase of 6.1%. PLD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, with the asset category being attractive even during challenging times, there is a development boom in many markets. This high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in some of the company’s markets in the upcoming quarters. Management expects vacancy rates to increase throughout the first half of 2024, peaking at 6-6.1%.Moreover, a high interest rate is a concern for Prologis. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company’s consolidated debt as of Dec 31, 2023 was $29 billion. For 2024, our estimate indicates a 1.4% year-over-year increase in the company’s interest expenses. Further, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Additionally, it provides a sense of security in times of market uncertainty or downturns, as dividend-paying stocks can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.Stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, Toll Brothers TOL, Iron Mountain IRM, NetApp NTAP and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.', 'Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and, thus, act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty, as well as stock market volatility.

These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock has appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers.

The sale includes Hess' 30% stake in a consortium that has discovered more than 11 billion barrels of oil in Guyana's Stabroek offshore block, which analysts say has potential recoverable oil at upwards of 20 billion barrels."", ""Exxon, which holds a 45% share of the consortium, with Hess and CNOOC owning minority stakes, claims the operating agreement governing the group gives it a right of first refusal to any sale of Hess's Guyana oil assets."", 'The contest for a share of the largest oil discovery in almost two decades could soon test Wirth’s famously calm demeanor. But a deal would be a legacy-maker for Wirth, who is known at the second-largest U.S. oil firm as an affable but firm boss.', 'Wirth won accolades on Wall Street for his refusal to get involved in a bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum in 2019, and then moved to boost Chevron’s reserves through a series of small deals.', ""His ability to play a long-game served him well in Venezuela, where he held onto the company's properties there amid years of hyperinflation and punishing U.S. sanctions."", 'The 63-year-old executive declined to be interviewed.', 'A spokesperson, however, stressed the company remains ""fully committed to the transaction, and is confident in our position.

And both underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2023, making them good candidates for investors who are seeking value."", ""But which is the better addition to your portfolio right now?

Coke shares are flat in the past year and Nike is down 16% even as the S&P 500 has jumped 27%."", ""Coke's relative outperformance reflects its stronger growth profile. Organic sales were up a healthy 12% in 2023, management announced in mid-February. Compare that to Nike's most recent 1% decline and there's a clear growth winner today. Coke's momentum is likely to carry on into 2024, with organic sales on track to stay in solidly positive territory. Nike, on the other hand, has warned investors to expect even weaker sales trends over the next six months."", ""Nike is making aggressive moves aimed at boosting profitability, yet you'll still prefer Coke for its sparkling earnings outlook.

You'll get a 3%-plus yield with the beverage giant's shares, or about twice Nike's yield. Coke also has a much longer track record of raising its payout (over 60 years compared to Nike's 22 years). That's a direct result of the company's dominant market position in the consumer staples industry. If you prefer stable sales and earnings growth, then Coke will be a better fit for you."", ""Coke seems like the cheaper stock at first glance, which might seem surprising given its better operating metrics. Shares are priced at 24 times earnings compared to Nike's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30. In this case, the price-to-sales ratio makes more sense as a valuation metric given all the volatility around currency exchange rate swings. Coke is trading at a premium there, both compared to Nike and to its rival PepsiCo."", ""Most investors will still prefer Coca-Cola stock even at its higher valuation. The company has attractive growth prospects in non-traditional beverage niches like energy drinks and sparkling waters. And its ample profits point to rising cash returns ahead.

The strong rally in the company’s share price can be attributed to the recent FDA approval of its first glucose biosensor, Stelo, which will provide glucose insights directly to a user’s smartphone. Moreover, the availability of the sensor over-the-counter to consumers without a prescription is likely to broaden Dexcom’s targeted patient population.', 'Stelo is likely to be available for purchase online without a prescription starting in the summer of 2024.', 'DexCom’s strong continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor portfolio, which includes G6 & G7 sensors, already has created a strong market potential.

This is certainly going to broaden the targeted patient population — primarily insulin users — of its CGM sensors, as DXCM can market the product to people with prediabetes.', 'Moreover, the availability of Stelo without a prescription is likely to be a key factor that will drive demand for the product as it is expected to increase the total addressable market by several multiple per market analysts.', 'Meanwhile, the obesity treatment market has been a lucrative spot in the medical industry. Recent hype and rally in GLP-1 drugmakers, following study data on weight loss, reflect the ongoing trend in the obesity market. CGM sensors are prescribed along with weight-loss drugs to better manage obesity, implying growing demand for such sensors as obesity treatment remains in focus. DexCom’s OTC sensor, Stelo, can now be used by patients to track their health while on weight-loss treatment even without an insurance coverage.', 'Per the CDC, about 38 million people living in the United States are diagnosed with diabetes, and 90-95% of people have Type 2 diabetes.

Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' View our latest analysis for Sempra ', ""We have to calculate the value of Sempra slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%. Compared to the current share price of US$70.6, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$3.1 / (6.0% – 2.3%)', '= US$83.5', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sempra as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase LKQ's shares on or after the 13th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.30 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.20 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that LKQ has a trailing yield of 2.3% on the current share price of US$51.48. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether LKQ has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for LKQ ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately LKQ's payout ratio is modest, at just 32% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 30% of its free cash flow in the past year."", ""It's positive to see that LKQ's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, LKQ's earnings per share have been growing at 18% a year for the past five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, two years ago, LKQ has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.5% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is LKQ an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that LKQ is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about LKQ, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", ""While it's tempting to invest in LKQ for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved.

One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits.

The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Eaton is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.', 'Eaton has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 56%, meaning that it is left with only 44% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.', ""Additionally, Eaton has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 32% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much."", ""In total, it does look like Eaton has some positive aspects to its business. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits.

This municipally owned system serves approximately 3,700 customers, most of whom already receive water service from New Jersey American Water. The agreement follows a voter referendum that took place in November 2023, in which over 80 percent of the voters approved the sale of the system to New Jersey American Water.', '""I want to thank the residents and elected officials of Manville for entrusting us to manage and improve their sewer utility and help safeguard the Borough and the environment from the many risks associated with operating a sewer collection system,"" said Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water.

In light of that, when we looked at American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for American Water Works Company, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.055 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$30b - US$2.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Thus, American Water Works Company has an ROCE of 5.5%.

The company has consistently earned 5.5% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 47% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital."", ""Long story short, while American Water Works Company has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 25% to shareholders over the last five years.

AI helped design the formulation of the zero-salt bouillon cube, as well as the way it would be produced on the company’s manufacturing line.', 'The world’s largest food companies for decades have leaned on AI, and in recent years they have been accelerating their embrace of the technology, including newer use cases for generative AI. “CPG [consumer packaged goods] and retail have been using AI to do a host of things, including the ability to better predict demand,” says Michelle McGuire Christian, chief commercial officer of ConvergeConsumer, a collaborative initiative between Deloitte and Google Cloud. “They’ve been using it to optimize the supply chain for a long time,” she added, including the merchandising and placement of products within a store.', 'Unilever’s AI models are used to help predict taste, consumer preferences, and microbiological stability, as well as determine if a product can run on a factory line. By using AI, the time needed for product development can go from months to just a few days. “The data-enabled decision-making allows you to find more of the sweet spot,” says Hilhorst. “You can be more precise.”', 'Other AI innovations include Hellmann’s vegan mayo, for which Unilever used advanced modeling to predict the taste, texture, and stability of a product that would omit egg. AI has helped lessen Unilever’s food waste. For Hellmann’s squeeze bottles, a thin layer of oil coating was added to the interior of the package so that only one to two servings of mayo would remain in the container, versus an average of around five before AI formulation predictive models were utilized.', 'AI also helped Unilever pivot after Russia invaded Ukraine and the company had to quickly configure alternative formulations for ingredients that became difficult to procure, including sunflower oil.', 'Athina Kanioura, PepsiCo’s chief strategy and transformation officer, says the snacking giant has used more “traditional” forms of AI for years, ranging in use from innovation, to planning with suppliers, to the optimal routes drivers should take when delivering products. The company is also starting to test generative AI for several parts of PepsiCo’s business, including software development, handling queries to call centers, and food formulations.', 'PepsiCo has developed internal standards to ensure everyone who uses AI does so safely. “We have the infrastructure that sits in our environment where we can give access to the sandbox of AI for people to test the different capabilities,” says Kanioura.', 'And with the world of snacking constantly evolving, PepsiCo says AI can help synthesize what consumers want at a faster pace, while also solving the best path forward to develop those foods and beverages across the supply chain. At the heart of those flavor development decisions, PepsiCo stresses, are human insights. “The next big thing didn’t come from the tech, it came from the consumers,” says Kanioura.', 'PepsiCo says the company’s AI efforts are focused on efficiency and growth, not expenses. “I’m not in a rush to drive cost optimization from gen AI,” says Kanioura.', '“AI is going to help us get the levels of accuracy and speed that we haven’t had in the past,” says Anton Vincent, president of Mars Wrigley North America. “We’re hopeful that as we start to think about taking complexity out, AI is going to be a big driver for us.”', 'The candymaker says it has used AI for several years to help with sourcing, manufacturing, and digesting industry data to determine trends in the food industry. As for large language models, Vincent says, “we are trying to use it to drive productivity across all parts of our value chain. We’re early days in that.”', 'To move that journey along, Mars is opening an AI lab in the first quarter of 2024 at the company’s Newark corporate office. “The AI lab offers the opportunity for every associate to walk in with an idea and hopefully walk out with a plan of action,” says Gabrielle Wesley, chief marketing officer for Mars Wrigley North America.', 'Marie Wright, chief global flavorist at food processing company ADM, recalls a time when flavorists wrote down formulas in “beautiful” books, which would form the basis of the flavors that were produced in factories. But the movement to computers, and more recently AI, has changed how the industry handles formulations and data.', '“There’s been such great strides in the past number of years on the AI platform,” says Wright. “And then it’s like, how do we apply that to a creative skill such as creating flavors?” She acknowledges that “many flavorists are afraid of AI. And I would say most creative people are afraid of AI.”', 'ADM says it uses AI not to take away the work of flavor development, but to improve the process. Wright says it is critical that the technology group doesn’t just mandate AI tools to be used. Instead, flavorists should be encouraged to be part of the AI journey.', '“AI has to come into play because we as humans can’t process that data,” says Wright. “AI has the big advantage of being able to process that data quickly to learn from and then ultimately start doing that machine learning and then hopefully be able to do more predictive things in terms of new formulas, new ways of working, and maybe in my estimation, we should become better at creativity.”', 'Bayer says it has been a fairly early adopter of AI tools like machine learning. Take the example of corn: Before plant breeding, roughly 20 to 30 bushels were grown on an acre of land. Today, the average corn yield is 175 bushels. Part of those gains were from how farms evolved their fertilizer and agronomic practices, but a big chunk was through genetic improvements thanks to AI.', 'AI helps Bayer crunch the data to determine the best parent candidates that a breeder can cross to create corn offspring that’s the most successful in the field. There are billions of combinations possible for the genes in corn that are responsible for yield.', '“It was clear that the human mind wasn’t capable of ingesting all the massive amounts of data we are now collecting and making enough sense of it,” says Bob Reiter, head of global research and development for crop science at Bayer. “It’s huge to break through and be able to unlock more of that genetic potential than we ever could have in the past without AI tools.”', 'The predictive algorithms on which parents to cross and which genetic combinations to create have become so sophisticated that Bayer can undergo the process three to four times a year versus every few years before AI. “It’s really going to be in the future a big accelerator of continuing to increase that productivity for the farmer on that acre that they’re planting,” says Reiter.', 'And with the world’s population projected to reach 8.5 billion in 2030 and increase to 9.7 billion in 2050, farmers have to increasingly become more efficient.', '“It’s foundational to helping feed a growing global population,” says Reiter.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

We've made a lot of progress, delivering cost savings and gross margin expansion, and this work helped us deliver meaningful improvement in adjusted operating margin of 410 basis points for 2023. Our focus on controlling the controllables also resulted in better working capital and a stronger balance sheet at year-end."", 'This includes reducing our inventory levels by 16% year over year, building a strong cash balance of $1.9 billion, and generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow. These proof points put us on strong financial footing as we begin 2024. Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrate strong progress, not only in terms of improved margins and well-controlled expenses but also with more stability in net sales. Net sales grew by 1%, and comps were flat, with Gap Inc.', ""gaining market share. The sequential improvement, which is noteworthy in a declining apparel market, reflects the team's responsiveness and nimbleness as we begin our brand reinvigoration work. Old Navy comps increased 2%. And we were pleased to gain share in women's for the fourth quarter, building on the success we saw in the third quarter."", ""We are also encouraged that we increased our foothold in two key categories: active and bottoms. As the No. 5 player in the active space, we are excited for Old Navy to accelerate in this leading category. The all-important bottoms category creates additional opportunities because it's the gateway to the full wardrobe. Gap brand's comps were up 4%, driven by strength in women's where we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of market share gains."", ""This result was amplified by good performances in denim and sweaters, supported by new marketing campaigns. Banana Republic comps were down 4% as we conduct deliberate and ongoing work to reestablish the brand. And Athleta's comps were down 10% as we lapped a period of heavy discounting that we previewed last quarter, but improved sequentially driven by new holiday product, updated marketing, and improved in-store presentation. We expanded our company gross margin by 530 basis points, ahead of expectations, driven by more effective sourcing strategies and lower commodity costs, combined with improved promotional activity, leaner inventories, and better assortments."", ""We also increased our operating margin by 570 basis points to 5%. Our team is demonstrating the ability to do what we say we are going to do and, in some cases, even more. However, we're not where we need to be. Our ongoing focus on financial and operational rigor will allow us to continue to elevate our performance, improve execution consistency, and set the foundation for our exciting brand reinvigoration work."", ""Turning to our next priority, brand reinvigoration is about driving both relevance and revenue, inspired by our brands' incredible heritage. As a reminder, this strategic priority begins with strengthening the identities and purpose of each of our brands. We are striving for each brand to have trend-right product assortments rooted in customer-centric design thinking and a clear point of view that delivers on both wants and needs. From there, we need to execute several key ingredients."", 'We must consistently deliver product storytelling that excites our customers, supported by compelling merchandising. We need to drive demand with innovative marketing to regain a powerful voice in the cultural conversation. And we must create better, more engaging omnichannel experiences with a clear and compelling pricing strategy. And most importantly, we must execute with excellence along every touchpoint and interaction.', ""These elements form the basis of our brand reinvigoration playbook. While specific execution will differ by brand, we are working with each of our brand teams to implement this playbook holistically and consistently. Now, I would like to provide an update on the progress of each brand. Let's start with Old Navy."", ""We are encouraged by the sales performance we saw in the back half of 2023 and the growth we delivered in the quarter. We are reasserting Old Navy's authority as the No. 2 apparel brand in the U.S. We delivered on-trend products, particularly in women's, active, bottoms, and knits, which performed well in the quarter."", 'Supported by our campaign with Natasha Lyonne, we showcased and leveraged our authority in the bottoms business and saw great response, especially to the Taylor pant, the refreshed Pixie pant, and the Cargo. We are celebrating Fashion, Family, and Fun through more precise marketing and storytelling. Another example of reasserting our authority is Jingle Jammies. We took our famous Jingle Jammies and created Jingle Glammies, supporting it through a compelling social media campaign where influencers paired jammies with going-out wear.', ""This demonstrates how we take a product and make it a trend by dialing it up in a relevant way through storytelling. Old Navy is reinforcing value by communicating to customers with more clarity on price and quality, both in stores and online, highlighting the brand's value proposition. We are seeing the strength of the brand identity evolving and coming alive through online and visual communications. The progress we are making at Old Navy gives us confidence in our ability to build consistency while we deliver against our priorities."", ""Let's turn to Gap brand. We are driving continuous improvement, and Gap has exciting potential as we focus on reigniting the brand dialogue. Gap was built on strong product narratives with brilliant marketing, expressed through big ideas. Gap, in its best days, was a storyteller who could take a product and create a trend using culturally relevant marketing. During the fourth quarter, our team took Cashsoft, Gap's innovative, washable fabric that feels like cashmere, and turned it into a big idea through creative storytelling, supported by elevated marketing and in-store design and digital presentation."", 'We amplified this innovative product idea, and it became a key contributor to the strength in sweaters we saw during the quarter. Its success is an important proof point that shows we can reignite Gap with big ideas and deliver improved results. And now, we are going to build on that example with relentless repetition. Our linen campaign, which launched in late February, is the big idea for spring.', ""The campaign is running now, and I encourage you to take a look. This is a great example of the brand taking trend-right product and amplifying it, turning it into a big idea expressed through compelling in-store merchandising and strong digital execution, with an innovative and culturally relevant marketing campaign entitled Linen Moves, featuring musical artists, Tyla and Jungle. We struck a cultural chord on Instagram and Tik Tok. Linen Moves was Gap brand's highest-performing video on both platforms ever. And we're just getting started."", ""Regarding Banana Republic, we are focused on reestablishing this brand to thrive in the premium lifestyle space. As I've dug in with the Banana Republic team, I've realized that we are behind on the fundamentals, having the right product in the right place, with the right price. 2024 will be about getting back to the basics, both for product and execution. This includes a focus on go-to wardrobe pieces and BR classics like sweaters, oxfords, suit separates, and khakis, those products that Banana Republic has been known for and will be again."", 'We are encouraged by the brand aesthetic, but it will take some time to get this right and unlock the potential of this business. Turning to Athleta. As we shared with you last quarter, the brand had missteps in prior years, and as a result, net sales for the brand remained muted in Q4 as we lapped markdowns, a challenge that we will continue to face through the first half of 2024. Athleta is a brand with significant growth potential and a clear and distinct positioning rooted in the Power of She.', ""Early holiday ideas like cold-weather train and our shine sets sold well. These great ideas were ultimately bought too small, but they are good proof points that we are on the right track at Athleta. We are making progress in resetting this brand, returning to the core of Athleta's positioning. We started the new year with a cleaner palate, and we've seen early successes in new arrivals."", ""Although the changes are small, we are learning and encouraged by the customers' early reaction. We are focused on resetting the brand for success and putting Athleta back at the center of the cultural wellness conversation while reengaging the brand's performance roots. Moving to the third strategic priority, strengthening our platform. We are focusing on building and sharpening our operational capabilities to improve effectiveness and efficiency, and in turn, drive cost leverage and demand generation."", 'I recently returned from a two-week trip to Asia, during which I immersed myself in our supply chain infrastructure. I spent time listening, learning, and understanding the facets of our supply chain network, and I have gained insight into the incredible long-standing partnerships we have built over the years. I also spent time in our Hyderabad office in India, studying our technology tools and capabilities. While encouraging, this is an area that we will be focused on elevating as part of our path to becoming a high-performing apparel company.', 'We are still in the assessment phase, but my intent is to cultivate a digital-first organization and mindset that uses technology to enable business strategy, enhance the customer experience, and capture future opportunities. We are also beginning to evaluate how we can better leverage our media and marketing with the goal of developing more compelling creative and more innovative media to support growth across the portfolio. I believe our platform gives us meaningful differentiation and has the potential to unlock additional value creation, and we will work to further build out our capabilities to drive efficiency and effectiveness. The fourth priority is culture.', 'Energizing our culture will fuel creativity and connectivity while driving accountability across our organization. As I mentioned earlier, the recent appointment of Amy Thompson has bolstered our leadership team and underscored our investment in building a culture where employees show up every day with purpose and a sense of belonging. Amy is a builder of highly effective cultures that integrate purpose, vision, mission, and values throughout an end-to-end employee experience, all dedicated to driving business success. This includes igniting a growth mindset with empowered leaders and aligned incentives.', ""I'm confident she will help us build a winning culture at Gap Inc. Today, our company is on strong financial footing. In 2024, we will continue to strengthen our fundamentals as we focus on our four strategic priorities. While there is a lot of work to do, I am energized by the progress we have made so far, and I am inspired by the team's commitment and talent."", 'I want to take a moment to recognize our global team for their ongoing dedication, and I look forward to continuing this work in partnership with them as we drive toward becoming a high-performing apparel company. And now, I will turn the call to Katrina for a closer look at our financials and our outlook for 2024.', ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""Thank you, Richard, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We are pleased to report fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results ahead of our expectations, with market share gains. We remain focused on the discipline we have created around margin recovery, expense actions, inventory management, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Richard noted, our financial and operational rigor continues to be foundational as we turn our attention to the reinvigoration of our brands in 2024. Before we begin, I'll note that all results reported today are inclusive of the 53rd week, except for comparable sales metrics. Some of the key highlights from fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 include the following: Fourth-quarter comparable sales were flat and net sales were up 1%, ahead of our expectations, driven by Old Navy and Gap brand's sales results during the important holiday season. And, while full-year 2023 comparable sales were down 2% and net sales declined 5% year over year, this performance was in line with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, as our financial and operational rigor begins to deliver more consistent performance. Old Navy drove a positive 2% comparable sales in the quarter, building increased confidence in consistent delivery of net sales growth."", ""For the year, Old Navy comparable sales were down 1%, with positive comp performance in the second half of the year, and market share gains in all four quarters. Gap brand drove 4% quarterly comparable sales growth with a positive 1% comp for the year, outpacing the market. We delivered 530 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q4 and 380 basis points of expansion for the year versus last year's adjusted gross margin, resulting from trend-right product, which, when combined with well-managed inventories, led to improved promotional activity. Margins also benefited from lower commodity costs. We reduced fiscal 2023 SG&A by over $300 million year over year on an adjusted basis as a result of our commitment to financial discipline. All of which resulted in an operating margin of 5% for Q4 and an adjusted operating margin of 4.1% for the year, a 410-basis-point improvement versus last year's adjusted operating margin, demonstrating meaningful progress on our path toward profitable sales growth. Inventories ended down 16% year over year and remained well controlled, driving better profitability and working capital. And we ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet, delivering $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. While we enter fiscal 2024 encouraged by the financial progress we have made, we are taking a balanced view of 2024 while we shore up the foundation of our brands. I will discuss our outlook in more detail in a moment. Let me start with fourth-quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were up 1% to last year at $4.3 billion, exceeding our previously communicated guidance range, and comparable sales were flat. The 53rd week added approximately 4 percentage points of sales growth in the quarter."", ""Also, the sale of Gap China last year had an estimated 2-point negative impact to Gap Inc. total net sales growth. Let me now provide fourth-quarter sales results by brand. Starting with Old Navy, net sales were $2.3 billion, up 6% versus last year, with comparable sales up 2%. This represented the second consecutive quarter of positive comps at the brand. Turning to Gap brand. Gap brand net sales of $1.0 billion were down 5% versus last year. Excluding the estimated negative impact to sales of 8 percentage points related to the sale of Gap China, net sales would have been up 3% versus last year. Comparable sales inflected positively, increasing 4%, driven by continued strength in women's, which gained market share for the fifth quarter in a row. Banana Republic net sales of $567 million declined 2% year over year, with comparable sales down 4%. Re-establishing Banana Republic will take time, and we know that there's work to be done to better execute many of the fundamentals in 2024. Athleta net sales of $419 million declined 4% versus last year."", ""Comparable sales were down 10%. While the sales trend improved versus the prior quarter, net sales performance was still challenged due to tougher comparisons as we anniversary a period of elevated discounting, a dynamic which we expect will continue through the first half of fiscal 2024. While Athleta sales remain negative from the headwinds related to lapping last year's significant promotions, we are encouraged by the positive customer reaction to our new assortments, cleaner store presentations, improved online experiences, better marketing execution, and innovative new customer activations, which give us confidence that the brand's efforts are driving underlying benefits. Now, turning to gross margin in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.9% expanded 530 basis points versus last year. Merchandise margin increased 500 basis points in the quarter compared to last year driven by an estimated 300 basis points of leverage from lower commodity and air freight costs, with the remaining leverage primarily driven by improved promotional activity, ahead of expectations, as strong holiday assortments and well-controlled inventory enabled lower discounting during the season. Rent, occupancy, and depreciation modestly declined on a nominal-dollar basis versus last year. As a percentage of sales, ROD leveraged 30 basis points. Now, let me turn to SG&A. SG&A was $1.46 billion in the quarter, largely in line with our prior outlook. As a percentage of sales, SG&A of 33.9% leveraged 40 basis points versus last year. Operating income was $214 million, up $244 million versus last year."", ""Fourth-quarter operating margin of 5% improved 570 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Fourth-quarter net interest income was $4 million as higher interest earned on cash balances offset interest expense. Our fourth-quarter tax rate was 15.1% and benefited from the release of certain reserves. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.49. Now, turning to full-year fiscal 2023 results. Net sales were down 5% to last year at $14.9 billion, and comparable sales were down 2%. The addition of the 53rd week contributed approximately 1 point of sales growth to the full year, and the sale of Gap China in fiscal 2022 had an estimated 2-point negative impact to Gap Inc. total net sales growth. Gross margin was 38.8%, expanding 450 basis points versus last year's reported gross margin and 380 basis points versus last year's adjusted gross margin. Merchandise margin increased 420 basis points versus last year on an adjusted basis driven by 200 basis points of benefit from lower air freight expense, with the remaining expansion primarily driven by improved promotional activity. Inflationary impacts from commodity costs were relatively neutral to the year. And ROD as a percentage of net sales deleveraged 40 basis points versus last year. Reported SG&A was $5.22 billion for the year, or 35% of sales. Excluding restructuring costs and a gain related to the sale of an office building, adjusted SG&A was $5.17 billion, down 6% versus last year, primarily driven by cost savings as a result of strategic actions. Reported operating margin was 3.8%."", 'Excluding $93 million in restructuring costs and $47 million related to the gain on sale of an office building, adjusted operating margin of 4.1% expanded 410 basis points versus last year. Fiscal year 2023 net interest expense was $4 million, as interest expense was largely offset by interest earned on cash balances. The reported effective tax rate was 9.7% for the year and the adjusted effective tax rate was 11%. During the year, we received discrete tax benefits from the impact of foreign operations, a transfer pricing settlement related to sourcing activities, and the release of certain reserves. Share count ended at 372 million. Reported earnings per share was $1.34. Excluding the impact of restructuring and the gain on sale of the office building, adjusted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted earnings per share includes $0.29 of discrete tax benefits and a $0.05 benefit related to the 53rd week. Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory levels were meaningfully below last year in all quarters, with fiscal 2023 ending inventory declining 16% year over year. We ended the year with cash and equivalents of $1.9 billion, an increase of 54% from last year. Full-year net cash from operating activities was $1.5 billion as a result of our improved operating profit and lower inventory buys. Free cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion. We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns.', 'During the year, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, representing annual dividends of $0.60 per share. On February 27th, our board approved maintaining a dividend of $0.15 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In summary, as I reflect on 2023, I am proud of the discipline and rigor we have brought back into our foundation, which has resulted in meaningful recovery in profits as well as strong free cash flow. I am also encouraged by the progress we made in the second half of the year with sales stabilizing in the fourth quarter, led by progress at Old Navy and Gap, early proof points of brand reinvigoration. We remain committed in 2024 to delivering continued improved performance through maintaining our financial and operational rigor. Now, let me turn to our 2024 outlook. Our attention in 2024 remains on controlling the controllables: gross margin recovery, expense discipline, inventory management, and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while we continue the foundational work related to our brands as we aspire to drive relevance and revenue.', ""We expect this rigor to deliver roughly flat sales, excluding the 53rd week, while delivering low to mid-teens operating income growth. Let me provide some details on our outlook. Starting with the full-year 2024. Our outlook of flat net sales year over year, excluding the 53rd week, assumes continued performance at Old Navy and Gap, offset by challenging comparisons for Athleta in the first half of the year as the brand laps elevated discounting from 2023 and a longer recovery timeline at Banana Republic. This net sales outlook also contemplates the following unique dynamics: First, as a reminder, 2024 is a 52-week year, but will be compared in total to a 53-week year in 2023. The loss of the 53rd week results in a detrimental impact of approximately $160 million to fiscal 2024 net sales. It's worth noting that the timing shifts associated with the 53rd week are expected to be impactful to both Q1 and Q4 in 2024. In the first quarter, we expect to benefit from the timing shifts as we lose a low-volume week in February and add a modestly larger week in May."", ""Additionally, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by the loss of the 53rd week. Second, we have embedded multiple scenarios that contemplate modest headwinds in the first half of the year related to late deliveries as a result of geopolitical issues in the Red Sea. We currently expect that impact will moderate in the second half of 2024, but we will monitor the situation closely as we move through the year. And third, we are not anticipating major changes to consumer dynamics and macroeconomic pressures in 2024. In addition, I'd like to comment on the potential impact of the recent CFPB ruling on late fees for credit card holders. Our outlook assumes a mid-year implementation of the ruling, which we expect to be largely offset in 2024 by other levers within our credit card program. Now, moving to gross margin. We anticipate gross margin expansion of at least 50 basis points for the full year, compared to fiscal 2023's gross margin of 38.8%."", ""Our gross margin outlook is driven by the following factors: We expect commodity cost tailwinds in the first half of the year, which we anticipate will become largely neutral in the second half of the year. We expect ROD to deleverage modestly on the lower sales volume resulting from the loss of the 53rd week. And we continue to take a measured view of the consumer environment in fiscal 2024, particularly as we lap significant improvements we delivered in promotional activity during 2023. Regarding SG&A. SG&A of $5.1 billion is expected to decline year over year as we benefit from $150 million in reductions related to last year's strategic actions and lower costs from the loss of the 53rd week, which are partially offset by wage inflation. We are committed to strong financial discipline, and we will continue to identify and pursue efficiencies as we drive our strategic plan. Considering the above dynamics regarding sales, gross margin, and SG&A, we see a clear path toward delivering low to mid-teens operating income growth in fiscal 2024 versus the $606 million of adjusted operating income in 2023. We expect full-year net interest expense to be similar to fiscal 2023, with interest expense being largely offset by interest on cash balances, however, we will be watching Fed actions to determine if lower interest rates over time might impact this dynamic in the year. We are planning for a more normalized tax rate of 28% in 2024. This compares to 9.7% in fiscal 2023 as we benefited from several discreet tax items which, as previously noted, added approximately $0.29 to fiscal 2023 earnings per share. We are planning capital expenditures of about $500 million for the year. Now, let me share some color on our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We are pleased with trends quarter-to-date and are planning for net sales in Q1 to be roughly flat versus Q1 2023."", ""Consistent with our full-year view, our first quarter outlook assumes continued performance at Old Navy and Gap, offset by challenging comparisons for Athleta and a longer recovery timeline at Banana Republic. As it relates to first quarter gross margin, we expect at least 100 basis points of expansion, compared to the adjusted gross margin of 37.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by commodity cost tailwinds. We continue to take a prudent approach in relation to the promotional environment in the first quarter. And we are planning SG&A of approximately $1.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In closing, we were pleased to deliver strong financial results during both the fourth quarter and the full year, demonstrated through gross margin expansion, expense discipline, lean inventory, and strong cash generation. The financial and operational rigor that we have worked to develop, and will continue to pursue, is enabling us to focus on reinvigorating our brands with the goal of generating sustainable, profitable growth, and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term. With that, we'll open up the line for questions. Operator?"", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Adrienne Yih -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you very much. And good afternoon and congratulations to everybody on the Gap team. Richard, my first question is, you know, the -- the hiring of Zac Posen as chief creative of Gap Inc.', 'but also to creative of Old Navy. So, number one, sort of where his focus obviously is going to be on Old Navy, but how are you expecting him to be used more broadly across Gap Inc.? And then, historically, Gap has had designers in the fold before. And we always say you design for the one in merchandise for the masses. So, I just want to, you know, get your philosophy on how you kind of expect to keep the guardrails on that.', 'And then, Katrina, if you could just help us with the $5.1 billion opex. It seems very flattish, but you had mentioned that there was -- there were opportunities. It seems a little bit -- it seems a little bit high, I guess, is the way I would put it. So, any color there would be great.', 'Thank you very much.', 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Thanks, Adrienne. I appreciate the question. And we're very excited to welcome Zac to the company and, in particular, to our largest brand, Old Navy, where he's going to be serving as chief creative officer."", ""Zac is one of America's most celebrated designers. His creative expertise, his cultural clarity has consistently evolved American fashion, making him really a great fit for the company as we engage our culture and look to reinvigorate our storied brands. Zac's role as chief creative officer at Old Navy is really designed to harmonize, orchestrate, and dial up the storytelling across product and marketing, looking at how we create brand relevance and curate experiences that ultimately celebrate the brand's own attributes, fun fashion, and value for the whole family. Now, as Zac gets more immersed in the business, his influence will be really well considered to enhance the continuity of the brand's reinvigoration, which we've already started to see show up on the scoreboards, and his leadership across the portfolio will add a new dimension of relevance. And I'm really looking forward to Zac on the team and having him get immersed in our portfolio and our brands."", 'Adrienne Yih -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Fantastic.', ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""And then, Adrienne, yeah, let me take on the SG&A question. It's a great one, and I think you'd agree that our -- we're committed to maintaining financial and operational rigor, which has really strengthened our financial footing. 2023 reflected the benefits of the ongoing work, particularly in terms of margins, expenses, inventory, cash flow. And we just delivered a year with SG&A reductions of approximately $300 million."", ""The outlook we provided today does reflect another $70 million of reductions that's really driven by the remaining $150 million reduction from last year's strategic actions, partially offset by inflationary pressures from wages and other headwinds. I believe we can make our cost structure more efficient and drive operating margin expansion, but we have work to do to get back to historical levels. So, our outlook today reflects our current point of view, but we'll continue to assess the efficiency of our investments and look for opportunities for reduction or redeployment where it makes sense. So, more to come as we move through the year."", 'Adrienne Yih -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Fantastic. Best of luck. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Bob Drbul -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst', ""Hi, good afternoon. Richard, I was wondering if you could spend some more time on -- on the marketing initiatives that are underway. You know, I've seen some changes within Athleta, but I've also seen, you know, the Gap campaign has been really highly visible. So, I guess if you could just talk about how you're approaching it and -- and I guess the -- the level of expense that you're there and sort of the commitment to sort of reinvesting in the marketing, I think that would be pretty helpful for us."", 'Thanks.', 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Yeah, Bob, thank you for the question. But marketing is a much more complex function today than it was in the past. And our brands need to show up where consumers are, but they need to show up in relevant ways.', ""And the media mix to create relevant demand creation has changed vastly, and we're approaching it very differently than in the past. There really is an art and science to creating demand today, and Gap Inc.'s brands have been behind, but we are working on delivering more efficiency with our marketing and media dollars to have more specific and significant impact. And what I would say is, while we don't share marketing spend by brand, it's really not about spending more; it's about spending more efficiently. And I think you can take the Gap linen campaign, as you mentioned, as an example. You know, Gap's probably furthest along in this new approach using a holistic approach, social influencers, streaming, linear, throughout all the way through our store's site to amplify this big idea. And I think, as you'll see, you need to be driving a message consistently from the top to the bottom of the marketing funnel."", ""And historically, we've not done a good job of keeping the message consistent throughout the funnel. And this is a great example of our new marketing methodology. Now, on Athleta, which you mentioned specifically, which again, you know, is another great example, you know, we have a really significant opportunity with this important brand. The Power of She is a compelling brand platform, and we know the Athleta brand resonates with consumers, but our missteps in executing product marketing experience has ultimately weighed heavily on the performance of the brand in recent years."", ""Chris, as you know, Blakeslee joined us in 2023, leading a team that is driving the brand reinvigoration. And I think, as you start to see some of that reinvigoration playbook through marketing, great storytelling, executed through social media and our stores, we're very excited about really the tremendous potential of Athleta and Gap as well. As I mentioned before, incredible storytelling brand, historically a pop culture brand that truly does more than sell clothes, and today, we're really moving again. The current campaign, Linen Moves, it is a great example of Gap having a voice again in the cultural conversation, taking linen as an amplified big idea and doing it and owning it only the way Gap can; use it, leverage always been synonymous with gap. We've teamed up with Grammy Award winner, Tyla, and the recent Brit Award winner, Jungle, and created a credible storytelling campaign that's culturally relevant and resonating. And my last point, particularly in the marketing, you know, metrics that matter, places like TikTok and Instagram are new platforms for Gap in the context of being more relevant to our consumer. Linen Moves is currently Gap brand's highest-performing video on both of these platforms ever."", ""So, early days, we're encouraged with the momentum that we're seeing. The playbook is in action, and there'll be a lot more to come."", 'Bob Drbul -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Hey, everyone, congrats on the quarter. Two questions. Richard, maybe, first, can you just -- I hate to put you in a tough spot, but you know, there's -- let's leave Athleta and Banana alone. Ongoing outperformance, I think, was the -- was -- were the words for the guidance for Old Navy and Gap."", ""If you have to look at both of those brands, which one do you feel like you have your -- your -- your arms around the best in terms of branding and marketing and sustainable -- sustainability of positive comps? And then, the follow-up question would be for Katrina. Just I think based on your guidance, you're around 4.5, 5% margin. If we kind of go back pre-COVID, you were kind of consistently in the high single digits. How are we thinking about, multiyear, the building and the foundation that you guys are doing? If you can sustain, you know, low single-digit growth, like, how should we think about the ultimate margin structure of the company over time?"", 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Ike. Like -- first off, I'd say my arms are everywhere in the context of, you know, what we're trying to achieve here. And I think, again, speaking for the quarter results, we exceeded expectations on both top and bottom line, gaining market shares. And the strength was really driven by the two largest brands in our portfolio, Old Navy and Gap."", ""And more specifically, you know, Old Navy, it's the largest brand in our portfolio, and we've been working on reasserting the brand's authority as the No. 2 apparel brand in the country. You know, we have a strong retail presence. We have over 1,200 stores and an incredible online presence, which I would encourage you to take a look at today in the context of its clarity and new relevant persona. We did have a strong quarter."", ""You know, our sales were up 6% with comps up 2%. We gained share in all segments but did particularly well in women's, which we dialed up from a marketing perspective. And I will say the team has done a great job driving the financial and operational rigor, and Old Navy is really starting to see early signs of that brand reinvigoration. In particular, we know Old Navy has a reference reinforcing style authority but with more clarity on price and quality, both in stores and online. And again, we're very encouraged with those early results and the consistency that we expect to have throughout the year in 2024 as we build upon that discipline. I talked about Gap in the previous question, but similar, you know, we've had a great, you know, quarter with Gap, and year."", ""We were very happy with the positive comps, and we've been working to reignite Gap and drawing on what made this brand so special in the first place. And ultimately, I think this campaign that you're seeing in the market today -- again, go online, take a look -- I think it's a great example of the playbook and action and Gap having a voice and culture, again, taking an idea in our storytelling and amplify in a way that only Gap can."", ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""And then, I'd like to talk more specifically to the margin structure. I would say I do see a path to delivering operating margin expansion in the long term. We have work to do to get back to historical levels. I think, first and foremost, you know, this business leverages nicely when we get the top line moving, and it hasn't been growing regularly. And that's really what the brand reinvigoration work that Richard's been referencing is all about, getting our businesses back to relevance and revenue and driving the top line."", ""That, unto itself, will drive operating margin expansion. And in the meantime, we've been through several years of transformation. Partnering international markets, closing our unprofitable stores, divesting of smaller brands, all that reduced the fixed cost base. And then, recently, we've been doing other cost actions, all of which have -- that discipline has taken out about $550 million of costs, and that led to this cost structure that leverages so nicely on sales growth."", ""And -- and we just talked about it, we'll consistently evaluate the cost structure to identify additional opportunities. So, you know, again, to sort of end where I started, there's a path to delivering operating margin expansion in the long term as we get back to delivering consistent sales growth."", 'Ike Boruchow -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thanks so much.', 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Ike.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from J.P.

And any change in momentum that you're seeing at Old Navy or Gap as we think about early spring and some of the maybe early trends? And then, Katrina, so you're coming off 500 basis points of merchandise margin expansion, inventories are down mid-teens. I guess, how best to think about the magnitude of merchandise margin opportunity in 2024, just considering some of the product cost tailwinds and maybe your view on the promotional landscape."", 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Absolutely, Matt, thanks for the question. As mentioned, Gap Inc. gained market share in the quarter, year over year, which we were very pleased with, and that is on the backdrop of a declining overall industry. So, even more credit to the strength of these two particular brands at this particular time.', ""It was driven, of course, by Old Navy and Gap, as mentioned. And frankly, what we've seen in particular is, you know, in -- in Gap Inc., we gained share in, literally, all segments. The stores gained share driven by Old Navy and Gap. And also, outerwear, sleep, pants, woven, tops also gained. Kids and baby, as fair to mention, is a really important segment of our business. The Old Navy is the No."", ""1 kids and baby brand in the U.S. Gap Inc. owns 9% of the total market, and we've have proven capabilities and brands that resonate in this category. And so, over time, it's also an opportunity for us to accelerate and become even more important of a player in this segment. And as you'll see, and we evolve our -- our dialogue going forward, you know, we have opportunities in several key categories of strength: denim, active, kids and baby."", 'These will all be really good conversations for us to have as we move forward with our reinvigoration plans.', ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""And then, on gross margin, I just provided guidance for the full year of at least 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year and at least 100 basis points of expansion for Q1. So, let me talk to you a little bit about that. I think, as you noted, the rigor we utilized in 2023 drove 380 basis points of expansion year over year. For -- and as we recaptured a lot of inflation in the back half of the year and we had stronger assortments with the tighter inventories that we had overall, we're really maintaining that rigor and committed to that as we head into 2024."", ""I think you saw that we ended with 16% less inventory year over year, and we expect similar inventories coming out of Q1. And so, that inventory rigor will allow us to lap the about 200 basis points of improvement from less promotions last year this year, as we head into the year. So, commodity cost tailwinds in the first half this year will become largely neutral in the back half. And we are maintaining the rigor so that we can continue to lap last year's outsized promotion improvement."", 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Matt.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.', 'Mike Binetti -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys, congrats on a great quarter. I'm just -- I guess I'm just following a little bit of math here. You've got the merch margins up nicely to 2019 in the quarter, but I don't -- I don't know that all the brands are back above 2019 margins. So, I know -- I know you were asked about merch margins a little while ago. I -- you know, I don't think all the brands are above."", ""Can you speak through a brand lens where you see the opportunity the most on merchandise margin from here and how you're attacking that opportunity and the plan you gave us today? And then, I think if I heard you right, you said that ROD -- you mentioned that ROD would leverage. Do you think ROD leverages excluding the 53rd week this year? Maybe the cadence of ROD through the year, please?"", ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""Sure. So, I think -- if I think about the performance for 2024, our outlook includes the fact that our brands are in sort of different places as it relates to brand reinvigoration. And similar to the performance we just put up for 2023, we're seeing early proof points of the brand reinvigoration at Old Navy and Gap, our two largest brands, which really gives us more confidence in the brands' ability to be delivering consistent performance going forward. And so, while we don't guide by brand, we would expect Old Navy and Gap to deliver positive sales in the year."", ""We continue to reset Athleta. I think we talked about that. And as we lap the brand's missteps made in the prior year, that -- that will weigh on the revenue in the front half of the year. But we're encouraged, as we talked about, by the underlying progress in some of the early changes."", ""And longer term, we see lots of growth potential at that brand. And then, lastly, the recovery of Banana will take more time as the brand works on better execution of the fundamentals. But we don't disclose margins by brand. We're just encouraged by the outlook we provided today of overall operating income growth."", ""And we're just going to continue to use rigor in the middle of the P&L that will result in the low to mid-teens operating income growth that we gave today on roughly flat sales growth. As it relates to ROD, our principle for ROD, generally, on the year is that ROD leverages on flat to slightly positive sales. So, when you think about excluding the 53rd week, ROD is very slightly deleveraging on the year. And that's just, you know, some dynamics related to the 53rd week."", ""But that's how we think about ROD."", 'Mike Binetti -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Thanks a lot.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Lorraine Hutchinson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on Bob's question about marketing. Can you quantify how much you spent on marketing in 2023? And do you have aspirations to reduce this expense going forward or just deploy it -- redeploy it at current levels?"", 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, we don't disclose how we spend or what we spend on in the context of marketing. We invest in advertising over time, and our ad spend has grown to support our brands as a result of elevated costs. But in general, you know, ultimately, you know, our mission is to drive more effective and more efficient use of our dollars. Marketing dollars are continuing to come down year over year, and that is a direct function of -- in more innovative medium metrics that is sort of driving a more innovative approach to how we market. We're continuing to evaluate our marketing comprehensively as part of the brand reinvigoration work as well as part of media efficiency work, whether that results in lower spend in 2024 or better effectiveness of the current spend."", ""We're going to continue to see how that plays out. But regardless, we have plenty of marketing investment, do not need to be spending anymore, and we're going to continue to look for opportunities to be more efficient and save where appropriate."", ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""And, Lorraine, to be helpful, as Richard said, marketing dollars were down year over year in 2023. On our lower sales volume, marketing was about 5.9% of sales, which is below the prior year, 6.7%. So, as -- as we have slowly been pulling marketing down, as Richard said, we really are more focused on effectiveness and efficiency.

Please go ahead.', 'Brooke Roach -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping you can elaborate a bit more on the Athleta business. It sounds like some nice underlying proof points and some of the changes have been delivered in fourth quarter, but you're speaking to a tough first half on compares. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook that you see on any key line items that we should be looking out for in the second half across new product initiatives, marketing, and merchandise, and whether or not the underlying outlook provided today assumes an inflection back to growth this year for the brand?"", 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Thanks, Brooke, for the question. And Athleta is a really important brand in our portfolio. We believe that it has significant long-term potential.', ""The Power of She, as I've talked about, is just an incredibly compelling brand platform. And we know the brand resonates with consumers. Our missteps are -- are very public. You know, we've executed poorly in product marketing and experience, and that's weighed on the performance of the brand in recent years. But resetting the brand will take time."", ""We expect the tougher promotional volume comparisons to improve by the second half of 2024. The team is focused incredibly well on executing the brand reinvigoration playbook. They're leveraging the brand purpose, identity with great new product, exciting storytelling. It's supported by compelling marketing and really executed with excellence. I would encourage you to take a look at our sites, take a look at the social dialogue that we currently have on Athleta, even our stores that we started the new year with a very clean palette in our stores."", ""And we've seen early successes in some of the new arrivals and, again, encouraged by the customers' early reaction. I'm really liking where the team is going with the new drop strategy, innovation, color, and new customer activations, and we'll of course provide updates as we move through the year and assess the brand's continued progress in executing the playbook. But suffice it to say, we are very excited about the tremendous potential of Athleta."", 'Brooke Roach -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up for Katrina. Following the strong success in inventory management you've seen this year, can you provide an update on how you're planning inventory for this year and your outlook for improved inventory turns going forward?"", ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""Sure. So, for inventory, as we talked about, we ended with inventories down 16% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect end of Q1 inventories to be in about similar. I would say, as we start to lap these significant declines in inventory, by the time we get to the end of Q2, we'll start to see a more normalized year-over-year inventory dynamic, where inventories are down below sales growth but, you know, still lean. We're going to maintain the rigor we have around inventories, and I think we're at our best."", ""We've learned when we are reading and reacting to the consumer and chasing into trends. So, that's sort of how we're thinking about inventory for the balance of the year."", 'Brooke Roach -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Thanks so much.

Just on your comments for this continuation of the -- the trend at Old Navy and Gap on the -- on the top line, I'm just trying to understand what that means as it relates to sales growth. Should Gap continue to -- to bleed, or what's the right size of that business over time? And then, can Old Navy return to growth? And then, I have a quick follow-up."", 'Thank you.', 'Richard Dickson -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, look, I think, as we've said, our brands are all in different stages of reinvigoration. And ultimately, as we -- as we see the performance on Old Navy and Gap in particular, we're incredibly encouraged. I mean, as you've seen with Gap, the continuation of our reignition is working well. Again, you know, we had a great quarter in Gap, comp up 4%; Old Navy up 2%, as we've described. You know, these are not necessarily overnight fixes."", ""It will take time. But as a high-performing company, we want to do what we say we're going to do, and that is also setting up expectations that we believe that we can meet. We're, of course, aspiring always to outperform, and we believe that our outlook really reflects that. Each one of our brands is in a different point of reinvigoration. Again, very encouraged with the comps on Old Navy and Gap, and the early work on reinvigoration, which again, is supported by financial and operational discipline, is really showing up on the scoreboard."", ""I have noted Banana Republic has more foundational work to do to recover. The brand is a great brand, it's got great potential. The new aesthetic is resonating, but the product architecture, pricing, in stock, really the fundamentals, need continued work and effort, and the brand will take some time to reestablish. And as mentioned, Athleta is making good underlying progress but tougher comparisons from last year as the brand's lapping significant promotional volume. And it's weighing on the revenue performance. Now, we're going to continue to do this probably through the first half of 2024."", ""And as the headwinds from the promotions last year abate in the second half, we're energized by the potential of the brand and its brand reinvigoration work and the ability to see that brand show up better in performance."", 'Alex Straton -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Maybe, Katrina, one for you. Just on the guidance for the year, it looks like you have margin improvement following the first quarter."", 'Can you just talk about what enables that?', ""Katrina O'Connell -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer"", ""Yeah, I would say, broadly, as I think about margins for 2024, we have commodity benefits that come in the first half of the year.

Shares are jumping after the retailer beat on the top and bottom lines. With more on this and the wider retail landscape, let's bring in David Swartz, Morningstar Equity Analyst. David, it's good to see you. So listen, Gap reports, investors like what they see. This stock is surging about 10% right now in the after-hours, David. But give us your reaction. What did you make of the report?"", 'DAVID SWARTZ: The earnings per share are above the expectations was at $0.25 and Gap reported $0.49, so I think that explains why the stock is up. It looks like most of the benefit came from the gross margin. I did anticipate gross margin improvement, but it looks like it was even greater than expected, up about 5 points from last year when it was quite depressed.', ""The sales numbers, a little bit better than I expected. But certainly nothing to get excited about. Old Navy just had a 2% same-store sales growth number, which is pretty weak considering last year's fourth quarter was very poor for Old Navy. But you know, I think the stock has been undervalued. I've had it valued in the mid-20s. You know, I may revise that after we hear more from the company later today."", ""But, you know, I had the company-- had had the stock is undervalued for some time. And I think it's a good value. And I think people are starting to see that. Gap is really stable, although it's a troubled company."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And so when you look at something like the gross margin, for example, which the company attributes the improvement to lower air freight expenses, improved promotional activity, and also better rent costs, doing better on that front, presumably, you think there's some more wood to chop there, though, right? So what levers can the company still pull?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah. I mean, partly it comes down to sales growth. The sales numbers are still not strong. And that does affect the expenses, because the operating expense then right now is not at the right level for the sales. And so as the sales increase, the company will get some expense leverage on occupancy, as you mentioned, and other factors, because right now, it's not really operating at peak level."", ""So you know, I think that there is some ability to improve the margins, but we have seen improvement from really low numbers, to be honest. Still, a 5% operating margin is nothing to be excited about for this company. I do think it will go higher in future years, especially as Old Navy has higher margins than Gap's other brands. But it really depends on how Old Navy develops."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And David, a quick question as well about the CEO. You know, Richard Dixon is fairly new on the job. So what so far do you make of the job he's doing?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah. It's only been a couple quarters since he took over.

They've had merchandising problems. They tried some new styles and including new sizes. And that strategy didn't really work. It was partly because a lot of things were delayed by the shipping problems that came out of the pandemic. And you know, so I think that some of the merchandising issues are starting to get fixed."", ""But there is some concern that I have that Gap has lost customers at Old Navy that may not be coming back, because Old Navy has really been struggling for some time now.
