But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have seen the share price rise 61% over three years, well in excess of the market return (21%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 1.7% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Charles Schwab, it has a TSR of 67% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Charles Schwab shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.7% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 10% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors.

The industry enjoyed a record growth spurt as a confluence of unusual events led to a golden age for the chipmakers. Demand surged as consumers were flush with cash and in a mood to buy electronics. The drive toward increased e-commerce, streaming and remote work also powered a lot of semiconductor spending at a corporate level. Throw in supply chain shortages and artificial capacity constraints as well — it all led to an earnings boom.2022 has reversed those positive headwinds, and the semiconductor stocks have sold off. Many traders are probably tempted to buy the dip here, particularly as the tech stocks may have already hit bottom and the sector is now rallying. It’s easy to imagine how much money can be made owning the semiconductor stocks when they go back to their 2021 highs. However, the truth is that it will take a lot longer for most chips stocks to get their momentum back.As a result, these six semiconductor stocks are still sells for the time being, though there is one industry player that looks positioned to avoid the current doldrums.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNVDANvidia$161.20AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$70.14WOLFWolfspeed$81.37MRVLMarvell Technology$40.41ENPHEnphase Energy$317.05LSCCLattice Semiconductor$69.45TXNTexas Instruments$173.75Semiconductor Stocks to Sell: Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a classic example of a great company at bad price. The price of Nvidia stock soared to previously unimaginable levels in 2020 and 2021.The company had a trio of factors that all came together perfectly. Nvidia benefitted from the boom in cryptocurrency, which greatly raised demand for high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Then, with folks stuck at home, people were willing to spend more for video cards for gaming. On top of that, Nvidia itself has a strong management team and was able to produce a variety of successes with its research and development efforts.Story continuesNvidia still has the same good leadership and strong product focus. However, the other tailwinds are long gone.Cryptocurrency has plummeted. Gaming demand returned to normal as the economy reopened. This has led to a sharp decline in the outlook for Nvidia’s earnings and growth rate for the foreseeable future. Combine that with a nosebleed valuation from last year, and it’s no surprise shares have fallen this far.Even today, NVDA stock is still going for a stiff 38 times forward earnings. And the prognosis for earnings isn’t great, given the headwinds described above.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), like Nvidia, is another company that has made excellent strategic moves which the market then blew out of proportion. CEO Lisa Su is a skilled leader, and AMD has made tremendous gains against chief rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in recent years. There’s no taking away from that.However, much of AMD’s recent growth was driven by the unprecedented demand for laptops and other consumer electronics during the pandemic. As people prepared to work and study at home, laptop sales soared. Now, demand has dropped, with PC sales falling off a cliff.And, over the longer term, personal computing was a mature market with minimal growth prior to the 2020 disruption. Long story short, expect more difficult industry conditions where AMD and Intel fight tooth and nail for share in a flat to slightly declining market. That’s all well and good, but it doesn’t justify the sort of valuation we saw for AMD stock last year. Long story short, AMD shares have dropped a lot, but the stock is still up 600% over the past five years. That’s pretty frothy.Wolfspeed (WOLF)WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockWolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) is a smaller semiconductor company looking to commercialize advanced silicon carbide technology. It was previously known as Cree and focused on LED lighting technologies. However, given the more promising opportunities elsewhere, it changed its name to Wolfspeed in 2021 and investors have rewarded the new focus.The company’s appeal isn’t hard to see. The company provides silicon carbide solutions to automobile manufacturers. Key customers include Jaguar Land Rover (NYSE:TTM). Wolfspeed’s solutions can give electric vehicles better charging, which helps alleviate vehicle range anxiety. Wolfspeed also sees a variety of other functions for its silicon carbide technology and views it as “the future of semiconductors.”However, Wolfspeed is much more of a future growth story than anything that can be justified by current results. The company has to dramatically increase production and ramp up commercial operations to go from promising story to a proven profitable business.As such, this isn’t the sort of market in which to take a shot on Wolfspeed. For the time being, investors are rewarding companies with stronger profits and cash flows, not ones with a promising technological story but a less-than-robust set of operating results to back it up.Marvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor company which primarily operates in the storage and networking markets. The company’s key customer segments include telecom, automakers, data centers and information technology providers, among others. Marvell is known for its rapid expansion; it has made several key acquisitions in recent years.After years of trading sideways, Marvell shares surged in early 2020. This made sense. Demand for all sorts of networking and storage applications took off with people stuck at home. Device sales hit record levels, driving storage usage. Meanwhile, people needed faster internet connections at home, leading to more network spending.These trends have now reversed. MRVL stock has also reversed, but it has farther to fall. Shares were around $25 at the start of 2020. They peaked at $90 last year and are now back to around $40.The company is currently trading around 18 times estimated forward earnings, but those estimates have been rapidly falling, given the unrelenting bad news we’ve heard from many of Marvell’s customers. Given these issues, investors in MRVL stock won’t be feeling marvelous heading into 2023. In fact, the stock could easily retest that prior $25 level before finding support.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a company which makes semiconductor-based microinverters. These convert energy at the individual solar module level. This is vital for solar panel installations to control and optimize the generation and storage of electricity.Enphase has had tremendous success in recent years. Annual revenues grew from $316 million in 2018 to an estimated $2.3 billion for full-year 2022. The demand for solar power has grown, and Enphase was there with the right products to cash in.However, this great ride could be slowing down. The Biden administration already approved relief for American solar power installers. That means that this catalyst is already played out and priced into the stock. The business is slowing down as well. Enphase is expected to grow revenues 67% for full-year 2022. But the growth rate is expected to decline to 36% next year and just 25% in 2024.And while top-line growth has been tremendous, Enphase hasn’t turned all that much of its sales into earnings. ENPH stock is trading at an estimated 162x this year’s earnings and 70x 2023 earnings. That’s simply far too expensive for an industry like solar, which is heavily reliant on external factors for continued success.Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a chipmaker focused on low-power programmable units. The firm has a broad-based business and counts dozens of well-known customers among its revenue base. 50% of revenues come from industrial and automotive markets, 41% comes from communications and computing and 9% comes from licensing and consumer.Lattice has reported strong earnings compared to the rest of its industry. This has led to LSCC stock leaping 40% in recent weeks. With that surge, Lattice shares are now trading at close to their highest point since January 2022.This is all well and good for Lattice shareholders. You also can’t knock management’s deft handling of the current industry downturn. However, this rally has made LSCC stock exceptionally expensive compared to industry peers. Shares are trading at 65x trailing earnings and an estimated 36x 2023 earnings. That’s simply too expensive in this sort of market for a company that is expected to grow its topline revenues in the 10-15% range going forward.Semiconductor Stock To Buy: Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comThere’s a lot of bad news out there for semiconductor stocks. However, not all industry participants will face an equal burden from this downturn.Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is on a stronger footing because it manufactures analog semiconductors. These are chips which go into industrial applications such as automobiles, security and remote monitoring, and connected devices.Analog chips are a slower-moving market within semiconductors. This is because analog chips tend to be for more niche applications which have less competition. Analog chip designs also tend to have a far longer working lifespan than other varieties. This means that Texas Instruments tends to earn higher and more durable returns on its investments than peers.The company is laser-focused on increasing free cash flow per share. This, in turn, leads to large share buybacks and aggressive dividend increases with the firm’s prodigious cash flows. While fast-moving semiconductor fields such as chips for smartphones and laptops may see a prolonged downturn, Texas Instruments’ steadier business should keep investors in the green in 2023.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

3,08bce8b0-5739-30d4-a4cd-e0810d8fcaf0,NUE,2022-12-12,Nucor Corporation's (NYSE:NUE) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporations-nyse-nue-stocks-132747820.html,1670765267,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NYSE:NUE) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 5.8% over the last month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Nucor's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nucor is:48% = US$9.1b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.48 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Nucor's Earnings Growth And 48% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Nucor has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 20% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Nucor's considerable five year net income growth of 42% was to be expected.As a next step, we compared Nucor's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 34%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for NUE? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Nucor Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Nucor's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 23% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (77%) of its profits. So it looks like Nucor is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, Nucor is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 20%. Still, forecasts suggest that Nucor's future ROE will drop to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Nucor's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

AFL, Unum Group UNM, Trupanion TRUP, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF.Industry: Accident and Health InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027246/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-thriving-accident-health-insurance-industryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac Inc., Unum Group, Trupanion, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry in the coming days. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies that provide workers’ compensation insurance, largely to employers operating in hazardous industries. These players offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay.Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state-run workers’ compensation funds, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, thus, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 3% to $48.3 billion in 2022 based on revenues.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will again induce pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. Per Willis Towers Watson’s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey, workers’ compensation witnessed a slight price reduction in 2021.Per the survey, pricing at workers' compensation could be down 2% to up 4% in 2022.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #19, which places it in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has moved up 3.9% in a year.We present a few stocks one can buy or retain, given their business advancement endeavors.

ADI, MACOM Technology MTSI and Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP.Industry: SemiconductorLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027452/3-long-term-picks-from-the-semiconductor-industryThe strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred-supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that valuations are supportive.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, MACOM Technology and Microchip.About the IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Story continuesMajor Themes Driving the IndustryMost companies in this industry are positioned for strong growth this year followed by difficult comps and weaker demand in the next. It is the net effect of these companies being still somewhat behind schedule in delivering to the post-pandemic rush in demand. This in turn is because of supply chain disruption (which continues for most), driven by the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the more recent COVID shutdowns in China. Supply constraints also impact profitability as it may be necessary to idle capacity despite demand being out there. Going into 2023, some segments are seeing orders slow down or get rescheduled, which along with the slight uptick in cancellations, points to increasing caution at customers. But many of these companies have long term agreements stretching well into 2023, which means that any softness could take longer to show up in the results.The increasing use of electronics in vehicles, airplanes and defense equipment; increased factory automation; greater penetration of smartphones, tablets, notebooks, PCs and all manner of personal computing and other personal devices and smart household appliances; communications infrastructure moving to 5G; greater reliance on cloud infrastructure; the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), more advanced medical devices, EVs, self-driving cars etc continue to expand the addressable market for semiconductor chips. The constantly expanding addressable market makes this a very attractive industry for long-term investment. This is particularly true because the industry is capacity constrained based on today’s level of digitization, but this digitization is expected to increase manifold over the next decade because of the adoption of AI, EV and other emerging technologies. Additionally, the breadth of  markets and applications ensure that even if some segments (like consumer/computing) see demand pullbacks, emerging areas like AI, EV, IoT, etc. balance them out.The post-pandemic hybrid model, where more people move out of their homes more often but not all the time, is leading to an expansion of the overall electronic footprint of the consumer/computing segment. Near-term challenges here are related to strong uptake in the last couple of years. But there are other opportunities, including the metaverse and consumer devices incorporating newer technologies to enable more experiences. The number of semiconductors per device and their complexities also continue to increase, thus supporting demand.The adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, is another boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology enables in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials are increasing. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it is not totally replacing 4G but supplementing it, thus adding to component demand.Industry consolidation is important because the cost and complications of making chips rises in an environment where the adoption of semiconductors in devices of varying value requires prices to decline. Acquisitions are also driven by the need to expand R&amp;D capabilities and to acquire key talent.U.S. government officials worry that none of the most advanced chips are currently manufactured in the country. This is considered to be a national security concern given that semiconductors are playing an increasingly larger role in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. How exactly this situation will play out for the industry is unknown. Increasing capacity would depress prices. And U.S. production would increase cost. So much depends on the government’s contribution (perhaps through the CHIPS Act). In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 18% of more than 250 Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates uncertain near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.However, despite the industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries, the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate, is positive. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year. it appears that analyst opinion has significantly improved: 2022 estimates have risen 26.9% over the past year, while 2023 estimates have risen 2.9%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance AttractiveSince April, the Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It has however traded at a slight discount to the S&amp;P 500 though much of this period.Overall, the industry lost 17.1% of its value over the past year while the broader sector lost 34.9% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 18.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 16.34X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500’s 17.48X and the broader computer and technology sector’s 20.67X. At the current level, it is also trading below its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between its lowest point of 13.80X and highest point of 24.11X over the past year.3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc.: A fabless semiconductor company, Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Management is optimistic about near-term strength based on stabilizing orders, a strong backlog and continued design win momentum. Additionally, the increased scale and diversification, flexibility of its manufacturing model, and strengthening brand value are expected to help it navigate the economic downturn.This strength has allowed it to generate all-time high fourth-quarter revenues in the industrial, automotive and communications markets, as well as relatively modest growth in consumers. Analog Devices pays a regular dividend, and it increased the payout on a per share basis by over 10%.The company beat October quarter estimates by 5.8% and in the last 60 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased 28 cents (2.9%). The 2024 estimate increased 22 cents (2.2%).The shares are down 7.4% over the past year.MACOM Technology: The company designs and manufactures analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the radio frequency (RF), microwave, millimeter wave, and lightwave spectrum in the United States, China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Australia, Malaysia, and internationally data center, industrial &amp; defense and telecom markets.The company is seeing particular strength in telecom, data center and defense markets. 5G deployments and increased adoption of the cloud are drivers for MACOM and management is optimistic about share gains in 2023.MACOM topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 1.3% in the last quarter. Its 2023 (ending September) EPS estimate has dropped a penny in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased a couple of cents.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 stock are down 9.6% over the past year.Microchip Technology Inc.: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity, and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where the company is seeing supply constraints. This is also stretching out lead times and forcing the company to idle capacity, which hurts its profitability.Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently bought back a substantial number of shares and earlier this year, the board announced a 37.8% increase in the dividend.Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.Microchip beat estimates by 1.4% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has increased 24 cents (4.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate increased 6 cents (1.0%) during the same period.#3 ranked Microchip’s shares are down 11.5% over the past year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $73.17 a barrel, rising $2.15, or 3%.Last week, Brent and WTI fell to their lowest since December 2021 as investors worried a possible global recession could hurt oil demand.The potential of a prolonged outage of TC Energy Corp's Canada-to-U.S. Keystone crude oil pipeline helped turn prices around.""Keystone Pipeline repair appears to be taking longer than expected (and) upping the possibility of further stock draws at Cushing,"" said Jim Ritterbusch at Ritterbusch and Associates.Traders worried about how long it would take to clean up and restart the Keystone oil pipeline after more than 14,000 barrels of oil leaked last week, the largest U.S. crude oil spill in nearly a decade.TC Energy shut the pipeline after the spill was discovered late last Wednesday in Kansas. The company told officials in Washington County, Kansas, that they have not yet determined the cause or timeline for a restart.

The sources did not want to be identified as the information is confidential.Many banks globally are pausing dealmaking activities due to higher interest rates and weak economic prospects, with the U.S. economy heading into a short and shallow recession over the coming year.That has put pressure on earnings of investment banks after they made record profits last year from advising on mergers, acquisitions and initial public offerings as the world emerged from COVID-19-induced restrictions.Wall Street firms rely significantly on bonuses to hire and retain talent in a competitive business environment, but Morgan Stanley's major rivals are also reportedly cutting bonuses now.Story continuesGoldman Sachs Group's bonus pool for senior employees is expected to shrink by as much as half, news platform Semafor reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp are also considering cutting bonus pools by as much as 30%, Bloomberg Law reported earlier this month, citing people with knowledge of the internal deliberations.Wall Street investment bankers can expect much smaller bonuses this year as the economy slows, according to projections published last month by Johnson Associates Inc, a compensation consultant in New York.EXPOSED TO MARKET VOLATILITYCompensation and performance discussions at Wall Street banks typically begin in December, with overall bonus pools finalised by the year-end.In Asia, the biggest declines in Morgan Stanley's bonuses will be felt in areas including the capital markets businesses which are more exposed to global financial market volatility.This year's bonus discussions are taking place after Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said earlier this month that the bank was making ""modest job cuts"" worldwide.So far the bank has cut about 2% of its workforce, which affected about 1,600 positions, Reuters reported last week.In Asia about 50 investment banking jobs have been axed this year, said the first two sources. Over 90% of those cuts were made in Morgan Stanley's China teams based both onshore and offshore, one of them added.China's strict COVID-19 restrictions and tightened regulatory scrutiny on Chinese companies in the United States have taken a toll on Asian capital markets and mergers and acquisitions activity.MSCI's key Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index has lost about 18% this year. And Hong Kong IPOs, a key source of revenue for foreign banks in the region, are at the lowest point in 2022 in a decade, according to Refinitiv data.Morgan Stanley reported a 30% slump in third-quarter profit in October, missing analysts' estimate as a slowdown in global dealmaking hurt its investment banking business.(Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

The dividend yield will be 3.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Omnicom Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, Omnicom Group was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 11.4% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 41% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendOmnicom Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.8% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Omnicom Group May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, Omnicom Group has only grown its earnings per share at 4.8% per annum over the past five years. Omnicom Group is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.Omnicom Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Omnicom Group might even raise payments in the future. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

With just a couple of glitches, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held firmly above $17,000 for the past two weeks as the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion and other industry debacles has slowed.In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, noted that bitcoin has managed to hold the ""17K threshold,"" although the CPI, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate verdict, as well as the U.S. Labor Department's latest jobless claims report on Thursday could affect prices.""With these key events coming up, volatility is expected but the bias remains to the upside and we’d like to see $20K on the top and respect for $16K at the bottom,"" DiPasquale wrote.Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,275, also roughly unmoved from the previous day and when the weekend kicked off. Other major cryptos were trading slightly to the red, with decentralized network Cosmos' ATOM recently falling more than 4% and popular meme coin DOGE off 3.6%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank nearly 0.5%.Story continuesStocks closed down on Friday following an unexpectedly large rise in November's producer price index (PPI), which calculates monthly wholesale prices. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4%, higher than Wall Street expectations of 0.2%, suggesting that central bank measures to tame inflation have not been fully effective.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its recent diet of four consecutive rate increases 75 bps, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have reiterated their commitment to stem rising prices in recent weeks, and investors have fretted about the possibility of steeper, liquidity-squeezing rate hikes in 2023.BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that investors are already expecting a 50 bps lift, although it ""could rise further upon the [FOMC] announcement.""Biggest GainersThere are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.Biggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorCosmosATOM−4.1%Smart Contract PlatformDogecoinDOGE−3.6%CurrencyDecentralandMANA−3.0%EntertainmentInsightsUniswap 'Fee Switch' Proposal for Ether Pools Stirs Up Community DebateBy Shaurya MalwaA proposal by crypto exchange Uniswap to test whether reducing trading fees will result in significantly lower volume has attracted a lot of interest from community members and users.The proposal was put forward in July to pilot a ""fee switch"" for a small set of Uniswap protocol pools. The vote was postponed until Dec. 1 to allow more time for people to think about it. On Dec. 2, the vote moved forward and the decision was to go ahead with the test.The switch will not increase fees for users, but will retain a small portion of what is currently paid out to liquidity providers (LP), or users who lock up their tokens on Uniswap in exchange for fee rewards.The fee switch – if enabled considering the current conditions – could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap’s liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap’s native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.The proposal is a pilot program and is intended to evaluate the impact of turning on the fee switch on trade execution, on a small set of Uniswap pools that utilize USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI) and ether (ETH) over a 120-day period.The experiment will be considered a success, Uniswap’s developers said, if trading execution is not diminished for pools with the fee switch turned on. It is one of the many ongoing examples of community-led decisions that dictate the future growth of protocols like Uniswap.Meanwhile, community reactions remain mostly positive, albeit with caution.Some users in favor of the proposal said not moving ahead with the changes meant “stifling governance/revenue model innovation,” while some expressed concerns  that liquidity providers could pull their funds from the platform.One user called the proposal “a very important moment for Uniswap,” but opined that it was currently the “wrong time” to execute the move.“While we may identify that the fee switch does not or has a minimal negative impact on these metrics for certain pools, taxing LPs certainly cannot help here. I see only downside across the core KPIs,” the user, tagged as “Jack_Longarzo” on Uniswap’s governance forum, said.They added: “The other reason is that this proposal could have very serious and unpredictable negative externalities for the Uniswap community. The Uniswap Foundation’s brief discusses the severe lack of clarity for decentralized finance in the U.S. It is very possible that this proposal could negatively impact community members like Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and even individuals in the community. I don’t think the proposed exploration is justifiable amidst these uncertainties.”Important events3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) United Kingdom Gross Domestic Product (MoM/Oct)3:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(19:00 UTC) United States Monthly Budget Statement (Nov) 4:25 p.m. HKT/SGT(20:25 UTC) Bank of Canada's Governor Macklem SpeechCoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Agrees to Testify Before Lawmakers; Bitcoin Regains $17KSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, tweeted he's ""willing"" to testify at a Dec. 13 House Financial Services Committee hearing.

The reading could herald a similar trend in the consumer price index, which is due on Tuesday.Rising U.S. inflation spurred a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed this year, which weighed heavily on metal markets by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.The central bank is also set to conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, where it is expected to raise rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points. But the scale of future rate hikes will be largely driven by the path of U.S. inflation.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,793.72 an ounce, while gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,804.95 an ounce by 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT). The yellow metal had ended last week largely flat, as traders hunkered down ahead of major data releases this week.Other precious metals also retreated on Monday, with platinum futures down 1.7%, while silver futures fell 0.9%.Markets are wary of any signs that U.S. inflation remained stickier-than-expected in November, which could point to more rate increases by the Fed. The central bank has warned that U.S. interest rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels if inflation proves to be stubborn.The dollar strengthened slightly on Monday in anticipation of the U.S. economic indicators, having also taken some support from the higher-than-expected PPI inflation data.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell on Monday after two straight weeks of gains, amid growing uncertainty over COVID in China.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.8412 a pound.China scaled back several nationwide anti-COVID restrictions last week, a move that is expected to eventually spark a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.Story continuesBut analysts warned that the relaxing of COVID restrictions is likely to cause a near-term jump in infections, which could delay the further withdrawal of curbs.This has cast doubts over the timeline of an economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Weakening economic data from several major economies has also dampened the outlook for copper, which usually tends to benefit from a high-growth environment.Related ArticlesGold creeps lower as U.S. Fed, CPI week kicks offWork proceeds on Ukraine's power supply, particularly Odesa, says ZelenskiyTC Energy says has not found cause of Keystone oil pipeline leak]"

According to a new survey conducted by Realtor.com® and HarrisX among 3,001 U.S. adults, 82% of Americans with pets who are planning to buy a home within the next year consider their pets' needs just as important, if not more so, than their own needs or those of their family.More than three-quarters (77%) of U.S. homeowners have a pet at home, and 79% of pet owners say they factored their pet in when choosing which home or apartment to live in.

Nearly one quarter would even give up a shorter commute (23%), an extra bathroom (22%) or an office (21%).Two-thirds (67%) of prospective buyers with pets say they'd buy a home specifically because of features that cater toward their pet, while almost half (49%) of current homeowners with pets would do so.Eighty-seven percent of those with pets looking to buy a house within the next year say they are factoring their pet in when choosing which neighborhood to live in, and more than two-thirds (70%) of current homeowners say they would factor in their pet when choosing a new neighborhood.Homeowners making ""purr-fect"" spaces with catios, dog doors and fenced-in yards.In some cases, homeowners have decided to take measures into their own hands by adding pet-friendly features, such as patios, dog doors and fenced-in yards, to their space.More than two thirds (69%) of pet owners looking to buy a home within a year say they would build or install special pet features in their home, and half (51%) of current homeowners with pets have built these features. The #1 feature in both groups: a dog door.Of the homeowners who have built special pet features in their home, about two in five (39%) fenced in their yard, 32% built a horse barn/facility, or installed a climbing post (32%); 28% installed a dog shower/bath station, 22% added a dog run in their yard, and 21% built a ""catio.""Anyone looking for a pet-friendly rental can check out the ""pets"" filter on realtor.com/rentals which can help you search for homes that will accept furry family members.Methodology: This survey was conducted online within the U.S. from Aug. 9-12, 2022 among 3,001 adults by HarrisX.

""So I figured out pretty quickly this was a widespread campaign.""The email is part of a new and previously unreported campaign by a suspected North Korean hacking group, according to the cybersecurity experts, five targeted individuals and emails reviewed by Reuters.The cybersecurity experts suspect the hackers are targeting people who are influential in foreign governments to better understand where Western policy is headed on North Korea.The hacking group, which researchers dubbed Thallium or Kimsuky, among other names, has long used “spear-phishing” emails that trick targets into giving up passwords or clicking attachments or links that load malware. Now, however, it also appears to simply ask researchers or other experts to offer opinions or write reports.According to emails reviewed by Reuters, among the other issues raised were China’s reaction in the event of a new nuclear test; and whether a ""quieter"" approach to North Korean ""aggression"" might be warranted.""The attackers are having a ton of success with this very, very simple method,"" said James Elliott of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who added that the new tactic first emerged in January. ""The attackers have completely changed the process.""Story continuesMSTIC said it had identified ""multiple"" North Korea experts who have provided information to a Thallium attacker account.A 2020 report by U.S. government cybersecurity agencies said Thallium has been operating since 2012 and ""is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.""Thallium has historically targeted government employees, think tanks, academics, and human rights organisations, according to Microsoft.""The attackers are getting the information directly from the horse's mouth, if you will, and they don't have to sit there and make interpretations because they're getting it directly from the expert,"" Elliott said.NEW TACTICSNorth Korean hackers are well-known for attacks netting millions of dollars, targeting Sony Pictures over a film seen as insulting to its leader, and stealing data from pharmaceutical and defence companies, foreign governments, and others.North Korea's embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment, but it has denied being involved in cyber crime.In other attacks, Thallium and other hackers have spent weeks or months developing trust with a target before sending malicious software, said Saher Naumaan, principal threat intelligence analyst at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.But according to Microsoft, the group now also engages with experts in some cases without ever sending malicious files or links even after the victims respond.This tactic can be quicker than hacking someone's account and wading through their emails, bypasses traditional technical security programmes that would scan and flag a message with malicious elements, and allows the spies direct access to the experts' thinking, Elliott said.""For us as defenders, it's really, really hard to stop these emails,"" he said, adding that in most cases it comes down to the recipient being able to figure it out.Town said some messages purporting to be from her had used an email address that ended in "".live"" rather than her official account, which ends in "".org"", but had copied her full signature line.In one case, she said, she was involved in a surreal email exchange in which the suspected attacker, posing as her, included her in a reply.DePetris, a fellow with Defense Priorities and a columnist for several newspapers, said the emails he has received were written as if a researcher were asking for a paper submission or comments on a draft.""They were quite sophisticated, with think tank logos attached to the correspondence to make it look as if the inquiry is legitimate,"" he said.About three weeks after receiving the faked email from 38 North, a separate hacker impersonated him, emailing other people to look at a draft, DePetris said.That email, which DePetris shared with Reuters, offers $300 for reviewing a manuscript about North Korea's nuclear programme and asks for recommendations for other possible reviewers. Elliot said the hackers never paid anyone for their research or responses, and would never intend to.GATHERING INFORMATIONImpersonation is a common method for spies around the world, but as North Korea's isolation has deepened under sanctions and the pandemic, Western intelligence agencies believe Pyongyang has become particularly reliant on cyber campaigns, one security source in Seoul told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.In a March 2022 report, a panel of experts that investigates North Korea's U.N. sanctions evasions listed Thallium's efforts as among activities that ""constitute espionage intended to inform and assist"" the country's sanctions avoidance.Town said in some cases, the attackers have commissioned papers, and analysts had provided full reports or manuscript reviews before realising what had happened.DePetris said the hackers asked him about issues he was already working on, including Japan's response to North Korea's military activities.Another email, purporting to be a reporter from Japan's Kyodo News, asked a 38 North staffer how they thought the war in Ukraine factored in North Korea's thinking, and posed questions about U.S., Chinese, and Russian policies.""One can only surmise that the North Koreans are trying to get candid views from think tankers in order to better understand U.S. policy on the North and where it may be going,"" DePetris said.(Reporting by Josh Smith.

ADM, Deere &amp; Co. DE, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. BAH, Agilent Technologies A and Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD.5 Top Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid VolatilityThe year 2022 has been marked by huge volatility and uncertainty as high inflation, the Fed’s policy tightening and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue to weigh on investor sentiment. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing. Though the strategy doesn’t offer dramatic price appreciation, it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any type of market.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Deere &amp; Co., Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., Agilent Technologies and Boyd Gaming Corp. — that could be compelling picks amid volatility.Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

39,859f8412-ed6e-3bd4-96ad-61e5512315ef,PM,2022-12-12,Our 7 Top Consumer Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-consumer-stock-picks-185518697.html,1670525718,STORY,"['TJX', 'KR', 'UL', 'PG', 'PEP', 'PM']","[While household sentiment regarding financial expenditures slipping to near all-time recorded lows, the idea of top consumer stock picks for 2023 might seem unusually risky. Obviously, though, we no longer live in a society where individual families tended to their own needs. Rather, we outsource many services, choosing instead to align career paths with our abilities and/or talents.That’s a complicated way of saying that consumer stock picks for 2023 remain relevant, even under current circumstances. With very few people being their own farmers, tailors and dentists, if you want to live in the modern world, you’re going to have to open your wallet. And certain companies and industries enjoy inelastic demand, making them indelible. While the defensive consumer sector may be boring, boring is good ahead of a potential recession. Therefore, these are the top consumer stock picks for 2023.PEPPepsiCo$183.42ULUnilever$50.65CLColgate-Palmolive$77.85PMPhilip Morris$101.55KRKroger$47.36TJXTJX Companies$79.19PGProcter &amp; Gamble$151.26InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockOne of the classic ideas among the top consumer stock picks for 2023, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) may enjoy a recessionary-resistant business. Back during the Great Recession, Pepsi’s biggest rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed attention from some analysts for its resilient financial profile. Where both brands share similarities is that they facilitate the cheap pick-me-up thesis.As scientific studies demonstrate, sugary sodas attract consumers because of their addictive ingredients. “In regular sodas, the sugar causes dopamine releases in the brain, stimulating pleasure centers,” stated Natalie Stephens for the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.Moving forward, should we encounter either a domestic or global recession, it’s very possible that people will seek out escapism. A dopamine release may be just what the doctor ordered, making PEP one of the cynically oriented top consumer stock picks for 2023.Story continuesIronically, Pepsi is no slouch in the financial department. Although some of its core metrics could use some work, it enjoys excellent profit margins, as well as return on equity. Therefore, it enjoys the same qualities that made its rival a big hit during the last recession.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comAmong the most diverse consumer stock picks for 2023, Unilever (NYSE:UL) benefits from several recognizable brands. On the (literal) consumption angle, the company’s Ben &amp; Jerry’s line of ice cream products is always a treat. In addition, Unilever commands significant strengths in the personal and beauty care segment with brands like Vaseline, Axe, and Dove.Fundamentally, Unilever also spearheaded initiatives designed to foster social equity. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company report, people are willing to pay a small premium for responsibly sourced products. Given that Unilever’s pricing isn’t outrageously excessive compared to industry norms, management’s emphasis on doing good can be profitable. After all, millennials and Generation Z care strongly about various social issues – and they represent the future of consumption.On the financial front, Unilever attracts investors because of its present zero-debt profile. This gives the organization greater flexibility during rough times. Therefore, UL represents one of the top consumer stock picks for 2023.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAccording to a study of common fears in the context of mental conditions, dental phobia apparently caused the most stress among survey participants. It’s not surprising and it also provides a cynical catalyst for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). Therefore, it’s a name to consider when assessing consumer stock picks for 2023.During the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, people avoided health-related offices for fear of contracting Covid-19. Of course, the global health crisis provided a readymade excuse to avoid the dentist. Indeed, The Washington Post wrote an op-ed about the phenomenon.However, another pandemic – an economic one – might convince people to once again avoid the dentist’s chair. This time, a combination of high prices and natural revulsion of the practice may lead to missed appointments. Still, people aren’t going to let their dental health go just because of their phobias and financial pressures. Therefore, I anticipate Colgate-Palmolive to be one of the top consumer stock picks for 2023 out of sheer necessity (and perhaps desperation).Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comThough ranking among the more controversial names for consumer stock picks for 2023, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could see surprising demand in the months ahead. Already, the tobacco giant proved its worth. Since the start of the year, PM stock gained over 6% of market value. While not an astounding performance by any means, it’s a whole lot better than what the S&amp;P 500 put out.Currently, the benchmark equities index slipped 18% on a year-to-date basis.While global smoking prevalence declined since 1990, certain circumstances can change this dynamic. Most prominently, the specter of a worldwide economic slowdown can contribute to increased stress levels. In turn, this dynamic could spark increased prevalence as a means of escapism.Also, it’s worthwhile to note that many have turned to vaping for exercising their personal liberties. This too should help pad Philip Morris’ bottom line, making it an intriguing idea for consumer stock picks for 2023.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the most obvious idea among consumer stock picks for 2023, Kroger (NYSE:KR) fundamentally gets on this list for addressing critical demand. As a general rule, Everydayhealth.com notes that humans need a minimum of 1,200 calories daily to stay healthy. If you don’t get that minimum, bad things happen. Therefore, KR also represents a cynical trade.On a less macabre note, Kroger also benefits from being near the bottom of the trade-down effect. When consumers face financial pressures, they don’t necessarily stop all discretionary spending. Instead, they keep trading down to lower-cost alternatives until they reach equilibrium. While cheaper competitors to Kroger exist, they’re usually dollar-discount stores: not exactly the healthiest choice.Further, you can make the case that KR offers an undervalued prospect among top consumer stock picks for 2023. Currently, the market prices Kroger at 11 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 16.8 times.TJX Companies (TJX)a person carrying several shopping bagsSource: ShutterstockBack during the middle of the Covid-19 crisis, the Washington Post published an op-ed referring to the then landscape as a “pajama moment.” With white-collar workers operating remotely, it didn’t really matter what folks were wearing. Even during teleconferencing sessions, as long as you look presentable from the waist up, no problems materialized.However, this dynamic probably won’t last forever, which may bode well for TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). Specializing in off-price apparel, TJX may gain relevance as companies recall their workers back to the office. According to Resume Builder, 90% of companies surveyed will require their employees to return to corporate campuses at least part of the week starting in 2023.If folks have to go back to their cubicles, they’re going to need to upgrade their wardrobe. However, with the personal saving rate dramatically plunging since April 2020, discretionary funds may be running lean. Therefore, TJX would look much more compelling than normal, making it one of the consumer stock picks for 2023.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comUsually, I like to go for a speculative company with strong growth potential with the last idea. However, for this list of top consumer stock picks for 2023, I’m going to go boring with Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). Why not? When you’re going defensive, you don’t want to get too wild. With PG, you get a dependable investment you can trust.As a household goods giant, it’s difficult to imagine that Procter &amp; Gamble won’t regain its footing. Sure, its shares slipped nearly 8% YTD. However, if a recession materializes, available consumer funds will redirect toward the essentials, with the remainder (if any) moved toward discretionary purchases. Stated differently, Procter &amp; Gamble enjoys inelastic demand. No matter what happens in the economy, people will purchase basic everyday goods.Further, in the trailing month, PG gained nearly 10%, which suggests that the market is catching on. With economic pressures building, it may be time to consider this oldie but goodie.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This means the annual payment is 6.7% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Western Union's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 21.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 59%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.40 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.94. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Western Union has impressed us by growing EPS at 37% per year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Western Union could prove to be a strong dividend payer.We Really Like Western Union's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, Western Union has 2 warning signs (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) we think you should know about.

View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At HCA HealthcareOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Founder &amp; Chairman Emeritus Thomas Frist for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$215 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$238. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 91.70k shares worth US$19m.

Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of HCA HealthcareI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. HCA Healthcare insiders own about US$878m worth of shares (which is 1.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About HCA Healthcare Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

The execution of any business restructuring requires reliance on financial and operational data that fuel decisions like who keeps their current job and who doesn’t.In new reporting, Fortune's Luisa Beltran spoke to several current and former Goldman insiders about how the personnel chart will evolve: ""But as any Goldman tea leaf reader knows, strategic shuffles mean major winners and losers inside the company’s ranks,"" Beltran writes.Goldman CEO David Solomon announced in the fall the restructuring will include combining the firm’s wealth management and asset divisions into a single unit and merging its investment banking and trading businesses into another. In addition, Goldman created a new segment called Platform Solutions that will consolidate fintech platforms from across the firm. The changes are set to begin later this month.Regarding talent, the biggest winner is Marc Nachmann, a power player inside Goldman who will run the $2.4 trillion asset and wealth management unit. Beltran writes: “Nachmann, who was co-head of global markets (which includes trading), is considered a fixer and a cost-cutter. Trading revenue at Goldman hit $20 billion so far this year, up from $15 billion in 2019 when Nachmann took over, a spokeswoman said. He previously co-led investment banking from 2017 to 2019 and before that, from 2014 to 2017, was cohead of financing and head of Latin America.”Stephanie Cohen is again shifting her role. “During the last Goldman reorg, announced in September 2020 and put into effect the following January, the firm named Cohen, along with Tucker York, to cohead its consumer and wealth management business,” Beltran writes. “With the current shuffle, Cohen will become head of Platform Solutions. Some pegged the move as a lateral one for Cohen, while others pointed out that the executive remains the head of a major unit. It does cement her status as one of Goldman’s most powerful women.” You can read more here to learn about who else now has key positions, and who’s down and out due to the reorganization.Story continuesGoldman’s revamping comes as profits shrank in the third quarter. Investment banking generated revenues of $1.6 billion, down 57% year over year, and financial advisory revenues were $972 million, down 41%.""The further alignment of our businesses will help drive the organization forward,"" Goldman CFO Denis Coleman said during the Q3 earnings call.During Goldman's U.S. Financial Services Conference on Dec. 6, Solomon said the economy is slowing and expressed his concerns over a potential recession and the battle for talent. The largest cost for Goldman is “our people,” Solomon said. “The job market remains surprisingly tight and the competition for our talent, particularly top talent, is as strong as ever.”The firm has slowed hiring, Coleman said in the Q&amp;A portion of the earnings call. However, that “does not mean that we're not still making hires in the market,” he said. “We have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the firm.”Goldman is betting this revamp will help position itself for that growth.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comSign up here to receive CFO Daily weekday mornings in your inbox.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

Oddly, he goes on from there to claim that the deafening call for regulation means young “blockchain organizations” won’t be able to keep up with regulatory requirements. And that is especially true of cryptocurrencies, but we “shouldn’t miss the forest for the trees” – that is, we should recognize that blockchain can “support responsible innovation across the financial industry” without cryptocurrencies.We’ve heard that one before: “I don’t know about this bitcoin thing, but there’s surely some potential in the underlying blockchain technology!”You’re reading Crypto Long &amp; Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.To defend his position, Solomon shared how Goldman Sachs used a private blockchain to arrange a 100 million euro two-year digital bond for the European Investment Bank that was settled in 60 seconds instead of the usual five days. Praise be to its private blockchain!The takeaway is supposed to be that Goldman will use a private blockchain to reduce settlement times, ultimately lowering costs for all stakeholders.Except.The reason bonds settle in five days is not because of the lack of a blockchain; it’s because of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Adding a private blockchain isn’t going to rid Goldman Sachs’ bond placement process of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Especially when that deafening call for regulation is answered.Story continuesSure, maybe adding a blockchain is a solution, but really, it’s not for one main reason: Private, permissioned blockchains are worse than useless.Read more: How I Lost My Faith in Private BlockchainsBlockchains have killer apps – but this isn't itDon’t let anyone trick you; blockchains are not a complicated idea. If you know what a database is (an electronic repository of data), then you basically know what a blockchain is. Databases store data in a place. You or Goldman Sachs can access that data electronically if the database manager allows you access to that data. Otherwise, no data for you or Goldman Sachs.Blockchains are the same thing, but all the data is public and copies of the database are stored in many disparate places. In theory, just about anyone can join and maintain their own copy of the data on a computer they know and trust.If that sounds like a very narrow, minimal-potential use case and potentially slow technology, that’s because it is. There’s no need to allow everyone to have non-permissioned access to every piece of data all the time unless you are trying to get around needing a database manager or some other trusted third party to access that data. Something like digital money could be a good application of this technology.Anything else, you’re better off with a regular database.Really, the takeaway here is that blockchains are yet another round of narrow, minimal-potential-use-case technologies getting shoved into all sorts of broad applications where they simply shouldn’t be shoved. (Cue the conversation about pairing artificial intelligence with our drinking water, or whatever).Shipping company Maersk and tech giant International Business Machines tried to blockchain-ify supply chains and put tomatoes or bananas or whatever on the blockchain through a shipping blockchain called TradeLens (whatever that means). TradeLens failed and shut down two weeks ago after almost five years of trying. It failed because it didn’t reach “the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business” because the idea simply isn’t viable.I think the killer app for blockchain is decentralized money. Others think it's decentralized governance. These ideas come to life as unbanked women in Afghanistan seek financial freedom through Bitcoin and as crowdfunding efforts are organized to bid on things like the U.S. Constitution (a sillier example comparatively, sure, but pretty timely). The killer blockchain apps will most probably (and currently do) live on public, permissionless blockchains.All said, I can assure you of one thing: The killer app won’t come from private, permissioned blockchains used to settle bond placements by huge, multinational investment banks.]"

View our latest analysis for Netflix The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NetflixOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Co-Founder Wilmot Hastings for US$20m worth of shares, at about US$393 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$320). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Netflix insiders own 1.3% of the company, currently worth about US$1.9b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Netflix Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Netflix shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Netflix insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

49,859f8412-ed6e-3bd4-96ad-61e5512315ef,TJX,2022-12-12,Our 7 Top Consumer Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-consumer-stock-picks-185518697.html,1670525718,STORY,"['TJX', 'KR', 'UL', 'PG', 'PEP', 'PM']","[While household sentiment regarding financial expenditures slipping to near all-time recorded lows, the idea of top consumer stock picks for 2023 might seem unusually risky. Obviously, though, we no longer live in a society where individual families tended to their own needs. Rather, we outsource many services, choosing instead to align career paths with our abilities and/or talents.That’s a complicated way of saying that consumer stock picks for 2023 remain relevant, even under current circumstances. With very few people being their own farmers, tailors and dentists, if you want to live in the modern world, you’re going to have to open your wallet. And certain companies and industries enjoy inelastic demand, making them indelible. While the defensive consumer sector may be boring, boring is good ahead of a potential recession. Therefore, these are the top consumer stock picks for 2023.PEPPepsiCo$183.42ULUnilever$50.65CLColgate-Palmolive$77.85PMPhilip Morris$101.55KRKroger$47.36TJXTJX Companies$79.19PGProcter &amp; Gamble$151.26InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockOne of the classic ideas among the top consumer stock picks for 2023, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) may enjoy a recessionary-resistant business. Back during the Great Recession, Pepsi’s biggest rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed attention from some analysts for its resilient financial profile. Where both brands share similarities is that they facilitate the cheap pick-me-up thesis.As scientific studies demonstrate, sugary sodas attract consumers because of their addictive ingredients. “In regular sodas, the sugar causes dopamine releases in the brain, stimulating pleasure centers,” stated Natalie Stephens for the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.Moving forward, should we encounter either a domestic or global recession, it’s very possible that people will seek out escapism. A dopamine release may be just what the doctor ordered, making PEP one of the cynically oriented top consumer stock picks for 2023.Story continuesIronically, Pepsi is no slouch in the financial department. Although some of its core metrics could use some work, it enjoys excellent profit margins, as well as return on equity. Therefore, it enjoys the same qualities that made its rival a big hit during the last recession.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comAmong the most diverse consumer stock picks for 2023, Unilever (NYSE:UL) benefits from several recognizable brands. On the (literal) consumption angle, the company’s Ben &amp; Jerry’s line of ice cream products is always a treat. In addition, Unilever commands significant strengths in the personal and beauty care segment with brands like Vaseline, Axe, and Dove.Fundamentally, Unilever also spearheaded initiatives designed to foster social equity. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company report, people are willing to pay a small premium for responsibly sourced products. Given that Unilever’s pricing isn’t outrageously excessive compared to industry norms, management’s emphasis on doing good can be profitable. After all, millennials and Generation Z care strongly about various social issues – and they represent the future of consumption.On the financial front, Unilever attracts investors because of its present zero-debt profile. This gives the organization greater flexibility during rough times. Therefore, UL represents one of the top consumer stock picks for 2023.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAccording to a study of common fears in the context of mental conditions, dental phobia apparently caused the most stress among survey participants. It’s not surprising and it also provides a cynical catalyst for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). Therefore, it’s a name to consider when assessing consumer stock picks for 2023.During the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, people avoided health-related offices for fear of contracting Covid-19. Of course, the global health crisis provided a readymade excuse to avoid the dentist. Indeed, The Washington Post wrote an op-ed about the phenomenon.However, another pandemic – an economic one – might convince people to once again avoid the dentist’s chair. This time, a combination of high prices and natural revulsion of the practice may lead to missed appointments. Still, people aren’t going to let their dental health go just because of their phobias and financial pressures. Therefore, I anticipate Colgate-Palmolive to be one of the top consumer stock picks for 2023 out of sheer necessity (and perhaps desperation).Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comThough ranking among the more controversial names for consumer stock picks for 2023, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could see surprising demand in the months ahead. Already, the tobacco giant proved its worth. Since the start of the year, PM stock gained over 6% of market value. While not an astounding performance by any means, it’s a whole lot better than what the S&amp;P 500 put out.Currently, the benchmark equities index slipped 18% on a year-to-date basis.While global smoking prevalence declined since 1990, certain circumstances can change this dynamic. Most prominently, the specter of a worldwide economic slowdown can contribute to increased stress levels. In turn, this dynamic could spark increased prevalence as a means of escapism.Also, it’s worthwhile to note that many have turned to vaping for exercising their personal liberties. This too should help pad Philip Morris’ bottom line, making it an intriguing idea for consumer stock picks for 2023.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the most obvious idea among consumer stock picks for 2023, Kroger (NYSE:KR) fundamentally gets on this list for addressing critical demand. As a general rule, Everydayhealth.com notes that humans need a minimum of 1,200 calories daily to stay healthy. If you don’t get that minimum, bad things happen. Therefore, KR also represents a cynical trade.On a less macabre note, Kroger also benefits from being near the bottom of the trade-down effect. When consumers face financial pressures, they don’t necessarily stop all discretionary spending. Instead, they keep trading down to lower-cost alternatives until they reach equilibrium. While cheaper competitors to Kroger exist, they’re usually dollar-discount stores: not exactly the healthiest choice.Further, you can make the case that KR offers an undervalued prospect among top consumer stock picks for 2023. Currently, the market prices Kroger at 11 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 16.8 times.TJX Companies (TJX)a person carrying several shopping bagsSource: ShutterstockBack during the middle of the Covid-19 crisis, the Washington Post published an op-ed referring to the then landscape as a “pajama moment.” With white-collar workers operating remotely, it didn’t really matter what folks were wearing. Even during teleconferencing sessions, as long as you look presentable from the waist up, no problems materialized.However, this dynamic probably won’t last forever, which may bode well for TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). Specializing in off-price apparel, TJX may gain relevance as companies recall their workers back to the office. According to Resume Builder, 90% of companies surveyed will require their employees to return to corporate campuses at least part of the week starting in 2023.If folks have to go back to their cubicles, they’re going to need to upgrade their wardrobe. However, with the personal saving rate dramatically plunging since April 2020, discretionary funds may be running lean. Therefore, TJX would look much more compelling than normal, making it one of the consumer stock picks for 2023.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comUsually, I like to go for a speculative company with strong growth potential with the last idea. However, for this list of top consumer stock picks for 2023, I’m going to go boring with Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). Why not? When you’re going defensive, you don’t want to get too wild. With PG, you get a dependable investment you can trust.As a household goods giant, it’s difficult to imagine that Procter &amp; Gamble won’t regain its footing. Sure, its shares slipped nearly 8% YTD. However, if a recession materializes, available consumer funds will redirect toward the essentials, with the remainder (if any) moved toward discretionary purchases. Stated differently, Procter &amp; Gamble enjoys inelastic demand. No matter what happens in the economy, people will purchase basic everyday goods.Further, in the trailing month, PG gained nearly 10%, which suggests that the market is catching on. With economic pressures building, it may be time to consider this oldie but goodie.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

They had climbed 23.5% through Friday since the company disclosed in late November it was in preliminary talks with Amgen, Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson for potential offers. Amgen shares dipped less than 1% to close at $276.78.With the deal, Amgen gains two fast-growing drugs, the thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout treatment Krystexxa. Amgen hopes they can act as a bulwark against rising competition for its blockbuster arthritis drug Enbrel and as other key drugs in its portfolio, such as psoriasis therapy Otezla, face loss of patents over the next few years.Both Horizon medicines have an orphan drug designation, a status granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to encourage development of drugs for rare conditions that comes with a market exclusivity period if the drug is approved.Orphan status also means they would likely not be among the drugs for which the U.S. government's Medicare program can negotiate lower drug prices under the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).""We liked this company, even before the IRA,"" Murdo Gordon, Amgen's head of global commercial operations, said in an interview.""Given the IRA, the strategic importance of being in these kinds of disease areas with biologics primarily, and with products that have low Medicare exposure and orphan designation, makes it even more attractive,"" he added.Amgen plans to finance the deal through debt and cash, and has entered into a $28.5 billion credit agreement with Citibank and Bank of AmericaAmgen said it expects the deal to close in the first half of next year and add to earnings from 2024. It does not anticipate any ""overlaps of concern to regulators.""Story continuesSales of Amgen's Enbrel tumbled 14% in the latest reported quarter to $1.1 billion.Tepezza, Horizon's largest selling drug, saw sales double to $1.66 billion in 2021 from a year earlier.Analysts forecast Tepezza sales reaching $3.85 billion in 2028, while Enbrel sales are expected to fall to $1.89 billion during the same period, according to Refinitiv data.Horizon's gout treatment Krystexxa brought in sales of $565.5 million last year. They are forecast to reach $1.36 billion by 2028.""The offer clearly brings in a number of growing assets for Amgen,"" said William Blair analyst Matt Phipps.""However, the deal comes with significant debt,"" Phipps said, adding that the acquisition stretches Amgen's net debt-to-core-earnings ratio.Amgen is testing a closely watched obesity drug in early trials as it seeks to tap a potential multibillion-dollar market that has excited biotech investors.The Horizon bid follows Amgen's $3.7 billion deal in August for rare blood vessel inflammation treatment maker ChemoCentryx Inc.The offer values Horizon at $27.8 billion on a fully diluted basis, according to the company, which includes ordinary shares to be vested. Based on Reuters calculations, it values Horizon at about $26 billion and gives Horizon a $28.3 billion valuation, including debt.(Reporting by Manas Mishra, Bhanvi Satija, Khushi Mandowara and Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich, Sriraj Kalluvila and Bill Berkrot)]"

The reading could herald a similar trend in the consumer price index, which is due on Tuesday.Rising U.S. inflation spurred a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed this year, which weighed heavily on metal markets by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.The central bank is also set to conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, where it is expected to raise rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points. But the scale of future rate hikes will be largely driven by the path of U.S. inflation.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,793.72 an ounce, while gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,804.95 an ounce by 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT). The yellow metal had ended last week largely flat, as traders hunkered down ahead of major data releases this week.Other precious metals also retreated on Monday, with platinum futures down 1.7%, while silver futures fell 0.9%.Markets are wary of any signs that U.S. inflation remained stickier-than-expected in November, which could point to more rate increases by the Fed. The central bank has warned that U.S. interest rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels if inflation proves to be stubborn.The dollar strengthened slightly on Monday in anticipation of the U.S. economic indicators, having also taken some support from the higher-than-expected PPI inflation data.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell on Monday after two straight weeks of gains, amid growing uncertainty over COVID in China.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.8412 a pound.China scaled back several nationwide anti-COVID restrictions last week, a move that is expected to eventually spark a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.Story continuesBut analysts warned that the relaxing of COVID restrictions is likely to cause a near-term jump in infections, which could delay the further withdrawal of curbs.This has cast doubts over the timeline of an economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Weakening economic data from several major economies has also dampened the outlook for copper, which usually tends to benefit from a high-growth environment.Related ArticlesGold creeps lower as U.S. Fed, CPI week kicks offWork proceeds on Ukraine's power supply, particularly Odesa, says ZelenskiyTC Energy says has not found cause of Keystone oil pipeline leak]"

The average selling price of US$233 is still lower than the current share price, or in other words, insiders would have been better off holding on to their shares.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, sold US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$228 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$247). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's holding. Gregory Gallopoulos was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.Gregory Gallopoulos sold a total of 21.77k shares over the year at an average price of US$233. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does General Dynamics Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Dynamics insiders own about US$4.2b worth of shares (which is 6.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Dynamics Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of General Dynamics, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with General Dynamics and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The reading could herald a similar trend in the consumer price index, which is due on Tuesday.Rising U.S. inflation spurred a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed this year, which weighed heavily on metal markets by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.The central bank is also set to conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, where it is expected to raise rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points. But the scale of future rate hikes will be largely driven by the path of U.S. inflation.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,793.72 an ounce, while gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,804.95 an ounce by 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT). The yellow metal had ended last week largely flat, as traders hunkered down ahead of major data releases this week.Other precious metals also retreated on Monday, with platinum futures down 1.7%, while silver futures fell 0.9%.Markets are wary of any signs that U.S. inflation remained stickier-than-expected in November, which could point to more rate increases by the Fed. The central bank has warned that U.S. interest rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels if inflation proves to be stubborn.The dollar strengthened slightly on Monday in anticipation of the U.S. economic indicators, having also taken some support from the higher-than-expected PPI inflation data.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell on Monday after two straight weeks of gains, amid growing uncertainty over COVID in China.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.8412 a pound.China scaled back several nationwide anti-COVID restrictions last week, a move that is expected to eventually spark a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.Story continuesBut analysts warned that the relaxing of COVID restrictions is likely to cause a near-term jump in infections, which could delay the further withdrawal of curbs.This has cast doubts over the timeline of an economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Weakening economic data from several major economies has also dampened the outlook for copper, which usually tends to benefit from a high-growth environment.Related ArticlesGold creeps lower as U.S. Fed, CPI week kicks offWork proceeds on Ukraine's power supply, particularly Odesa, says ZelenskiyTC Energy says has not found cause of Keystone oil pipeline leak]"

It did not say when the review would be completed.The plan focuses on expanding the critical minerals sector and ""moving things forward expeditiously,"" Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said at a news conference in Vancouver.Wilkinson said the strategy, backed by nearly C$4 billion ($2.95 billion) allocated in the 2022 budget, ""is a roadmap for the creation of wealth and sustainable jobs throughout the value chain in every region of this country.""Under the strategy, companies will be offered help in applying for permits and for federal support through the Critical Minerals Centre of Excellence. The office is already operating with a team of about 15 people, said a senior government source.Critical minerals are key elements in EV batteries, electronics and solar panels and play a crucial role in the transition to the green economy. While Canada is home of some the largest deposits of critical minerals, it can take anywhere between five and 25 years for a mining project to become operational, the document said.""We recognize that, although responsible regulations are vital, complex regulatory and permitting processes can hinder the economic competitiveness of the sector and increase investment risk for proponents,"" the document reads.As the world shifts to cleaner technologies, demand for critical minerals is expected to skyrocket. Many in the mining industry have said the bureaucracy is too slow and is holding up investment.Story continues""What has been the tendency over many years is that the requirements just keep ballooning and you end up with impact assessment reports (for new mines) that are thousands of pages long,"" said Pierre Gratton, president and chief executive of the Mining Association of Canada, adding that he welcomed a review of the permitting process.""We're not looking for yet another overhaul of the federal regime. We're looking at opportunities to implement existing requirements more expeditiously. ... There are definitely opportunities to speed things up,"" he said.China dominates the market for critical minerals used in EV batteries.Countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan want to wean themselves from their dependence on authoritarian regimes for strategically important materials.'EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE OF CANADA'Canada signed a joint action plan with the United States in 2020 to advance secure supply chains for critical minerals. It has signed similar critical minerals cooperation agreements with Japan and the European Union.""I've talked to the Americans more in the last few years than I had ever talked to them in my entire career, and also Europeans,"" Gratton said. ""Everyone wants a piece of Canada right now, and they keep knocking on our door.""The new strategy lays out priorities along the entire critical-mineral value chain, from exploration and mining to recycling old batteries, and it also covers the need for new infrastructure in often remote corners of the country.Ottawa will seek ""regulatory harmonization"" with the United States on critical minerals, the document reads without elaborating.Ottawa's strategy prioritizes developing lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements. At the same time, Canada is offering a 30% tax credit to spur exploration for nickel, lithium, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium and uranium.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Is QUALCOMM Still Cheap?Great news for investors – QUALCOMM is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $153.82, but it is currently trading at US$119 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that QUALCOMM’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from QUALCOMM?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of QUALCOMM, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -16%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although QCOM is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to QCOM, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

(NYSE:PHM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-pultegroup-inc-125317081.html,1670849597,STORY,['PHM'],"[How far off is PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PulteGroup Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.24bUS$1.35bUS$931.6mUS$734.0mUS$629.4mUS$570.3mUS$536.2mUS$517.0mUS$507.1mUS$503.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -31.15%Est @ -21.21%Est @ -14.25%Est @ -9.38%Est @ -5.97%Est @ -3.59%Est @ -1.92%Est @ -0.75% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$2.1kUS$1.1kUS$724US$525US$414US$345US$298US$264US$238US$218(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.2bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$503m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.0%) = US$7.6bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.6b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$3.3bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$9.5b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$43.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PulteGroup as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.215. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For PulteGroup, we've compiled three further items you should further examine:Risks: For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for PulteGroup  that you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does PHM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. For example, the Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) share price is down 30% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 19%. Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 4.0% in three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 17% in the last 90 days.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Crown Castle share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 23%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Crown Castle's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Of course, it could simply be that it simply fell short of the market consensus expectations.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Crown CastleStory continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Crown Castle, it has a TSR of -27% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Crown Castle shareholders did even worse, losing 27% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 8% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Crown Castle better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Crown Castle   you should know about.Crown Castle is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Merck &amp; Co., Inc. MRK, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY and Deere &amp; Co. DE.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Early Q4 Earnings Results and Analyst Reports for Merck, Bristol-Myers and DeereThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features an update on the Q4 earnings season which got underway this week. We are also featuring the updated December Economic Outlook report, in addition to new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) and Deere &amp; Co. (DE).These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Economic Outlook for December 2022 —&gt; Christmastime U.S. Retail Sales UpdateQ4 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayThis week's quarterly reports from AutoZone (AZO) and Costco (COST) for their fiscal quarters ending in November that we count as part of the 2022 Q4 earnings tally. Next week's reports from the likes of Adobe, Orable, Accenture, Lennar and others will similarly count as part of the 2022 Q4 tally.Aggregate Q4 earnings for Costco and AutoZone are up +2.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with only one of the two (AutoZone) beating EPS and revenue estimates.Looking at Q4 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be down -5.9% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues.Excluding contributions from the Energy sector whose earnings are expected to be up +56.9%, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index are expected to be down -10.3% from the same period last year. Estimates have been steadily coming down, with the current -5.9% decline down from +1.7% on October 5th.Story continuesToday's Featured Analyst ReportsShares of Merck &amp; Co have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+52.7% vs. +19.3%) on the back of strong sales momentum from drugs like Keytruda and the Gardasil vaccine. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.(You can read the full research report on Merck &amp; Co here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+41.7% vs. -17.8%). Solid demand for the company’s blood thinner drug Eliquis and the label expansion of Opdivo are maintaining momentum for Bristol-Myers. Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and continues to experience growth in its market share.The label expansion of Opdivo into indications for lung cancer, renal cancer and gastric cancer boosted sales. The recent approval of drugs like Opdualag, Breyanzi and Sotyktu will add a new stream of revenues. Our estimates for BMY’s top line suggest a CAGR of around 1% over the next three years, driven by solid demand for legacy drugs and the approval of new drugs.However, Revlimid, one of the top revenue generators, is facing generic competition and sales are being adversely impacted.(You can read the full research report on Bristol-Myers Squibb here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Deere &amp; Company shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry over the past year (+23.6% vs. +21.7%). The company is poised well to gain on improving commodity prices, which will encourage farmers to spend more on farm equipment. Strong replacement demand will also continue to boost its top line.Demand for Construction equipment will likely benefit from anticipated growth in infrastructure investments. Higher material and labor costs will likely dent margins. However, we expect Deere’s adjusted earnings per share to grow 16% in fiscal 2023, led by strong demand and pricing. Product launches equipped with the latest technology to make farming automated will continue to provide it with an edge over its competitors.It will benefit in the long run from rapid growth in global population as well as the rising worldwide infrastructure needs. Our estimates for Deere’s bottom line suggest a CAGR of around 2% over the 2022-2025 forecast period.(You can read the full research report on Deere &amp; Company here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

73,86439c17-d5e5-3f98-b410-ea667d2e7546,WMB,2022-12-12,"Institutional investors may overlook The Williams Companies, Inc.'s (NYSE:WMB) recent US$1.9b market cap drop as long-term gains remain positive",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-overlook-williams-132117148.html,1670851277,STORY,['WMB'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 4.6% last week. However, the 31% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Williams Companies. View our latest analysis for Williams Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Williams Companies?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Williams Companies already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Williams Companies, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Williams Companies is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 7.3% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Williams CompaniesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Williams Companies, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$110m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Williams Companies. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Williams Companies better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Williams Companies   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

KMI, The Williams Companies Inc. WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.Industry: Oil &amp; Gas - PipelineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027138/3-oil-pipeline-stocks-to-gain-from-the-prospering-industryThe very nature of the midstream business model suggests that oil and gas transportation pipeline and storage operations have low exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is brightening up the outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry.Pipeline players are better off than upstream and downstream firms since the companies are generating stable fee-based revenues from their long-term contracts with shippers. Kinder Morgan, Inc., The Williams Companies Inc. and MPLX LP are among the frontrunners in the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry comprises companies that own and operate midstream energy infrastructure assets. The properties consist of extensive pipeline networks that transport crude oil, liquids and natural gas. The midstream energy players are also involved in the processing and storing of natural gas.The companies have interests in natural gas distribution utilities, serving millions of retail customers across North America. Some companies are ramping up investments in renewable energy and power transmission businesses.The firms invested in wind farms, solar energy operations, geothermal projects and hydroelectric facilities.Thus, with a diversified portfolio of renewable energy projects, the companies have room to generate extra cash flows in addition to stable fee-based revenues from the transportation assets.What's Shaping the Future of Oil &amp; Gas - Production and Pipelines Industry?Pipeline Demand to Improve: Oil price is trading at more than $70 per barrel. Crude price, which is still favorable, is helping explorers and producers to ramp up upstream activities, leading to higher production. This, in turn, is improving demand for crude transportation pipelines of the midstream players.Story continuesStable Fee-Based Revenues: Most pipeline and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term, making midstream businesses less vulnerable to volatility in commodity prices. Backed by long-term contracts, the companies belonging to the industry also have a minimal oil and gas volume risk. Owing to these factors, pipeline players will continue to generate stable fee-based revenues.Impressive Project Backlog: Many pipeline companies in the industry have a huge backlog of growth projects worth billions of dollars. The projects will come online in a few years, securing additional cashflows for the pipeline players.Attractive Dividend Yield: Oil and gas pipeline stocks are paying attractive dividend yields. Compared to the overall energy sector, companies belonging to the industry have been rewarding shareholders with significantly higher dividend yields over the past few years, providing reassurance that the midstream business is relatively more stable than upstream and downstream operations.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #67, which places it in the top 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates rosy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a positive earnings outlook for the constituent stocks in aggregate. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector, Outperforms S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector but outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has risen 11.1% over this period compared with the 26.4% improvement of the broader sector and 17.3% decline of the S&amp;P 500.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing oil and gas production &amp; pipeline stocks, the industry is currently trading at 12.85X, higher than the S&amp;P 500’s 11.92X. It is also above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.21X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.01X, as low as 8.81X and at a median of 13.36X.3 Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline Stocks Leading the PackMPLX LP: MPLX generates stable cashflows and has lower exposure to commodity price volatility since it is the operator of midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets. It also generates cashflows from a relatively stable fuels distribution business.Over the past 30 days, MPLX has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2022 and 2023. The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has attractive organic growth capital projects and is also pursuing low carbon opportunities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, Kinder Morgan is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. KMI generates most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has gained 12.1% so far this year, surpassing the industry’s 9% growth. KMI is poised to grow more on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-paypal-holdings-140035104.html,1670767235,STORY,['PYPL'],"[With its stock down 24% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to PayPal Holdings'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PayPal Holdings is:11% = US$2.3b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of PayPal Holdings' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, PayPal Holdings' ROE looks acceptable. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 15%. PayPal Holdings was still able to see a decent net income growth of 16% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable level of ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared PayPal Holdings' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 15% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is PYPL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is PayPal Holdings Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that PayPal Holdings doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with PayPal Holdings' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:6.8% = US$1.4b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.07 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the IT industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for International Business Machines by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Story continuesWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.International Business Machines' Debt And Its 6.8% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by International Business Machines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.52. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy.

81,68d9d26f-2da9-3d90-a7a7-410ce3b961d6,IBM,2022-12-12,International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) investors will be pleased with their 26% return over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-nyse-ibm-120210004.html,1670846530,STORY,['IBM'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) share price is 20% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 21% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 9.6% in the last three years.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year, International Business Machines actually saw its earnings per share drop 30%.So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Absent any improvement, we don't think a thirst for dividends is pushing up the International Business Machines' share price. Rather, we'd posit that the revenue increase of 42% might be more meaningful. Revenue growth often does precede earnings growth, so some investors might be willing to forgo profits today because they have their eyes fixed firmly on the future.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on International Business MachinesStory continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, International Business Machines' TSR for the last 1 year was 26%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that International Business Machines shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 26% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 5%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   5 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 can't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.International Business Machines is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at Target's (NYSE:TGT) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Target, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$56b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, Target has an ROCE of 15%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%. View our latest analysis for Target roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Target compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Target here  for free.So How Is Target's ROCE Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 15% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 26% in that time. Since 15% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.On a separate but related note, it's important to know that Target has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 43%, which we'd consider pretty high. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In the end, Target has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 168% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.One final note, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Target (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Check out our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Target. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Target, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Target. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 7.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of TargetThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Target Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$156m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Target. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Target (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Chico's FAS, Inc. CHS, Citi Trends, Inc. CTRN, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, PC Connection, Inc. CNXN and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Holiday Season Sales Aiding Retail Sector Rebound: 5 PicksThe retail sector, which has been under tremendous pressure owing to inflationary pressure, is making a solid rebound. The holiday season might just prove to be the stepping stone toward this recovery as sales skyrocketed despite concerns over rising prices.E-commerce, which helped the retail sector from a total collapse during the peak of the pandemic, is once again proving to be a key player in driving sales. Given this scenario, stocks with a strong online presence, like Chico's FAS, Inc., Citi Trends, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc., PC Connection, Inc. and Ross Stores, Inc. are expected to benefit in the near term.Holiday Season Driving Retail SalesAccording to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, the holiday season started on a high, with retail sales, excluding auto, jumping 10.9% year over year during the Thanksgiving weekend. Both in-store and online sales were robust.In-store sales rose 10.5% year over year during this period, while online sales climbed a solid 12.5% year over year for the weekend beginning Nov 24 (Thanksgiving Day) through Nov 27.Sales were primarily driven by higher purchases of apparel, electronic items and at restaurants. Sales at restaurants increased 23.3% year over year, while apparel and electronic items sales rose 14.4% and 2%, respectively.People have been compelled to spend cautiously owing to rising prices. As a result, retail sales slowed down over the following months. However, increased consumer demand has kept the retail industry from giving in to inflationary pressure. Additionally, the retail industry has been improving steadily, with sales up an impressive 1.3% in October.Story continuesRetail Sales ReboundA separate report from Adobe Analytics shows that online sales on Cyber Monday were $11.3 billion, up 5.8% from the previous year. In 2021 and 2020, Cyber Monday sales totaled $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. This year’s sales figures hit a new record after declining 1.4% in 2021.Over the course of the weekend, retail sales increased dramatically on several days, not just Cyber Monday. Black Friday online sales hit a record high of $9.12 billion. On Black Friday, overall e-commerce sales increased 2.3% from the previous year. Black Friday sales totaled $9.03 billion in 2020.Although online sales were growing, the pandemic worked miracles for e-commerce as millions shopped online out of fear of getting the COVID-19 virus. The trend has continued since then as people have realized the convenience of shopping online.E-commerce will continue to be very important during the holidays and in the months to come. According to the Department of Commerce, Internet sales in the United States surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in the last 12 months, totaling $1.02 trillion.The initial forecast for e-commerce spending was for it to reach $1 trillion in 2024 but the market has already outperformed the prediction this year, proving its enormous potential.Additionally, during the next two months, total retail sales are anticipated to reach $210 billion.The holiday season is an important sales period for retailers. Sales have already hit record highs over the Thanksgiving weekend and with the holiday season continuing into the first week of January, the retail sector is expected to begin 2023 on a high.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it would be wise to invest in these four stocks with a strong online presence.

ADI, MACOM Technology MTSI and Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP.Industry: SemiconductorLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027452/3-long-term-picks-from-the-semiconductor-industryThe strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred-supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that valuations are supportive.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, MACOM Technology and Microchip.About the IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Story continuesMajor Themes Driving the IndustryMost companies in this industry are positioned for strong growth this year followed by difficult comps and weaker demand in the next. It is the net effect of these companies being still somewhat behind schedule in delivering to the post-pandemic rush in demand. This in turn is because of supply chain disruption (which continues for most), driven by the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the more recent COVID shutdowns in China. Supply constraints also impact profitability as it may be necessary to idle capacity despite demand being out there. Going into 2023, some segments are seeing orders slow down or get rescheduled, which along with the slight uptick in cancellations, points to increasing caution at customers. But many of these companies have long term agreements stretching well into 2023, which means that any softness could take longer to show up in the results.The increasing use of electronics in vehicles, airplanes and defense equipment; increased factory automation; greater penetration of smartphones, tablets, notebooks, PCs and all manner of personal computing and other personal devices and smart household appliances; communications infrastructure moving to 5G; greater reliance on cloud infrastructure; the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), more advanced medical devices, EVs, self-driving cars etc continue to expand the addressable market for semiconductor chips. The constantly expanding addressable market makes this a very attractive industry for long-term investment. This is particularly true because the industry is capacity constrained based on today’s level of digitization, but this digitization is expected to increase manifold over the next decade because of the adoption of AI, EV and other emerging technologies. Additionally, the breadth of  markets and applications ensure that even if some segments (like consumer/computing) see demand pullbacks, emerging areas like AI, EV, IoT, etc. balance them out.The post-pandemic hybrid model, where more people move out of their homes more often but not all the time, is leading to an expansion of the overall electronic footprint of the consumer/computing segment. Near-term challenges here are related to strong uptake in the last couple of years. But there are other opportunities, including the metaverse and consumer devices incorporating newer technologies to enable more experiences. The number of semiconductors per device and their complexities also continue to increase, thus supporting demand.The adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, is another boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology enables in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials are increasing. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it is not totally replacing 4G but supplementing it, thus adding to component demand.Industry consolidation is important because the cost and complications of making chips rises in an environment where the adoption of semiconductors in devices of varying value requires prices to decline. Acquisitions are also driven by the need to expand R&amp;D capabilities and to acquire key talent.U.S. government officials worry that none of the most advanced chips are currently manufactured in the country. This is considered to be a national security concern given that semiconductors are playing an increasingly larger role in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. How exactly this situation will play out for the industry is unknown. Increasing capacity would depress prices. And U.S. production would increase cost. So much depends on the government’s contribution (perhaps through the CHIPS Act). In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 18% of more than 250 Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates uncertain near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.However, despite the industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries, the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate, is positive. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year. it appears that analyst opinion has significantly improved: 2022 estimates have risen 26.9% over the past year, while 2023 estimates have risen 2.9%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance AttractiveSince April, the Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It has however traded at a slight discount to the S&amp;P 500 though much of this period.Overall, the industry lost 17.1% of its value over the past year while the broader sector lost 34.9% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 18.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 16.34X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500’s 17.48X and the broader computer and technology sector’s 20.67X. At the current level, it is also trading below its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between its lowest point of 13.80X and highest point of 24.11X over the past year.3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc.: A fabless semiconductor company, Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Management is optimistic about near-term strength based on stabilizing orders, a strong backlog and continued design win momentum. Additionally, the increased scale and diversification, flexibility of its manufacturing model, and strengthening brand value are expected to help it navigate the economic downturn.This strength has allowed it to generate all-time high fourth-quarter revenues in the industrial, automotive and communications markets, as well as relatively modest growth in consumers. Analog Devices pays a regular dividend, and it increased the payout on a per share basis by over 10%.The company beat October quarter estimates by 5.8% and in the last 60 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased 28 cents (2.9%). The 2024 estimate increased 22 cents (2.2%).The shares are down 7.4% over the past year.MACOM Technology: The company designs and manufactures analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the radio frequency (RF), microwave, millimeter wave, and lightwave spectrum in the United States, China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Australia, Malaysia, and internationally data center, industrial &amp; defense and telecom markets.The company is seeing particular strength in telecom, data center and defense markets. 5G deployments and increased adoption of the cloud are drivers for MACOM and management is optimistic about share gains in 2023.MACOM topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 1.3% in the last quarter. Its 2023 (ending September) EPS estimate has dropped a penny in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased a couple of cents.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 stock are down 9.6% over the past year.Microchip Technology Inc.: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity, and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where the company is seeing supply constraints. This is also stretching out lead times and forcing the company to idle capacity, which hurts its profitability.Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently bought back a substantial number of shares and earlier this year, the board announced a 37.8% increase in the dividend.Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.Microchip beat estimates by 1.4% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has increased 24 cents (4.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate increased 6 cents (1.0%) during the same period.#3 ranked Microchip’s shares are down 11.5% over the past year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

91,ba713603-211f-3609-baa4-f13846ecc3f1,V,2022-12-12,What Does Visa Inc.'s (NYSE:V) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-visa-inc-nyse-v-110021379.html,1670842821,STORY,['V'],"[Let's talk about the popular Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Visa’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Visa What's The Opportunity In Visa?According to my valuation model, Visa seems to be fairly priced at around 5.9% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Visa today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $221.81, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Visa has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from Visa?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Visa's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 41%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? V’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on V, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Visa as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

The reading could herald a similar trend in the consumer price index, which is due on Tuesday.Rising U.S. inflation spurred a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed this year, which weighed heavily on metal markets by driving up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.The central bank is also set to conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, where it is expected to raise rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points. But the scale of future rate hikes will be largely driven by the path of U.S. inflation.Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,793.72 an ounce, while gold futures dropped 0.3% to $1,804.95 an ounce by 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT). The yellow metal had ended last week largely flat, as traders hunkered down ahead of major data releases this week.Other precious metals also retreated on Monday, with platinum futures down 1.7%, while silver futures fell 0.9%.Markets are wary of any signs that U.S. inflation remained stickier-than-expected in November, which could point to more rate increases by the Fed. The central bank has warned that U.S. interest rates could peak at higher-than-expected levels if inflation proves to be stubborn.The dollar strengthened slightly on Monday in anticipation of the U.S. economic indicators, having also taken some support from the higher-than-expected PPI inflation data.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell on Monday after two straight weeks of gains, amid growing uncertainty over COVID in China.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.8412 a pound.China scaled back several nationwide anti-COVID restrictions last week, a move that is expected to eventually spark a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.Story continuesBut analysts warned that the relaxing of COVID restrictions is likely to cause a near-term jump in infections, which could delay the further withdrawal of curbs.This has cast doubts over the timeline of an economic recovery in the world’s largest copper importer.Weakening economic data from several major economies has also dampened the outlook for copper, which usually tends to benefit from a high-growth environment.Related ArticlesGold creeps lower as U.S. Fed, CPI week kicks offWork proceeds on Ukraine's power supply, particularly Odesa, says ZelenskiyTC Energy says has not found cause of Keystone oil pipeline leak]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Snap-on (NYSE:SNA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Snap-on Snap-on's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Snap-on managed to grow EPS by 10% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Not all of Snap-on's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Snap-on maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 4.8% to US$4.8b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Snap-on's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Snap-on Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$12b company like Snap-on. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$212m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Snap-on, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.Snap-on's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$9.9m in the year leading up to January 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Snap-on Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Snap-on is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Snap-on, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Snap-on that you need to take into consideration.Although Snap-on certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

In the same rating action, Moody's also assigned a shelf rating of (P)Baa2 to Apartment Income REIT, L.P.'s senior unsecured debt shelf.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) shareholders have enjoyed a 94% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 41% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 8.3% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Air Products and Chemicals managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Air Products and Chemicals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Air Products and Chemicals will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Air Products and Chemicals' TSR for the last 5 years was 118%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Air Products and Chemicals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 8.3% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 17% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Air Products and Chemicals has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But note: Air Products and Chemicals may not be the best stock to buy.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide Is C.H. Robinson Worldwide Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$922.4mUS$586.5mUS$769.8mUS$908.1mUS$924.6mUS$941.9mUS$959.8mUS$978.3mUS$997.3mUS$1.02bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 1.82%Est @ 1.87%Est @ 1.90%Est @ 1.93%Est @ 1.94%Est @ 1.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$855US$504US$613US$670US$633US$597US$564US$533US$503US$476(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.9bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$18bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$8.2bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$14b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$95.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at C.H. Robinson Worldwide as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.061. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Director James Cameron admits he is not sure.""Can we be profitable in a changed market? Or are we just the last dinosaur dying after the comet hit? I couldn't tell you that right now,"" Cameron told Reuters ahead of the movie's debut on Friday.Distributor Walt Disney Co has not disclosed the budget for ""The Way of Water,"" but The Hollywood Reporter said production alone cost more than $350 million, putting it among the most expensive films in history.Studios split ticket sales with theaters, and Cameron told GQ magazine that ""The Way of Water"" will need to make $2 billion just to break even. Only four movies besides ""Avatar,"" including Cameron's ""Titanic,"" have crossed that threshold.The original ""Avatar"" enchanted audiences with pioneering 3D technology that brought to life the lush moon Pandora and its blue, 9-foot-tall Na'vi people. The 2009 movie remains the highest-grossing film in history with $2.9 billion in global ticket sales.But the lengthy interlude before the second film prompted questions about whether moviegoers still remember the story and have any interest in seeing it continue.""The common perception has been the first movie didn't enshrine itself in pop culture,"" said Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, because it did not feed fans a quick succession of sequels.""Avatar"" was touted as one of the jewels in Disney's $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets in 2019, a property it could elevate to franchise level alongside Star Wars and Marvel. Cameron has already filmed a third ""Avatar"" installment and part of a fourth.Story continuesThe director said it was a ""very legitimate concern"" that audiences might no longer care about ""Avatar."" But for him, those anxieties disappeared when the first ""The Way of Water"" trailer in May racked up 148 million views in 24 hours, he said.""What does worry me is the market has contracted,"" he said, ""due to the kind of double punch of streaming and the pandemic.""This year's U.S. and Canadian box office receipts are running 34% below 2019 levels.In ""The Way of Water,"" actors Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana return as Jake Sully and Neytiri 10 years later, now parents of five children.Their peaceful life is interrupted when the Sky People, the Na’vi name for humans, return to go after Jake. The Sully family seeks refuge with the oceanic Metkayina clan and must quickly learn the ways of the water to survive.This time, the 3D will showcase giant whale-like creatures, large flying fish and other animals that fill Pandora's seas.Filmgoers tired of 3D, however, in the mid-2010s. Some disliked wearing 3D glasses, or objected to paying the 3D ticket surcharge. Now, only Marvel superhero movies and a few other films come to theaters with a 3D option. Just 10% of ticket buyers choose that format, Robbins said.For ""The Way of Water,"" moviegoers will have the choice of 3D or the traditional 2D.Robbins is optimistic, he said, because Cameron is known for ""delivering on his big bets. He's always had a good feel for what audiences are looking for.""On opening weekend, Robbins predicts ""The Way of Water"" will rack up at least $150 million at domestic theaters. Two-thirds of its total box office grosses will likely come from outside the United States.The final tally will hinge largely on China, Robbins said. While the original film was a hit with Chinese audience and the sequel is cleared to play there, many theaters in China remain closed under the government's ""zero-COVID"" policy.

111,9fd614d0-3a50-3896-b245-03d59bc1b7d1,EXC,2022-12-12,What Exelon Corporation's (NASDAQ:EXC) ROE Can Tell Us,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exelon-corporations-nasdaq-exc-roe-143126063.html,1670769086,STORY,"['EXC', 'EXCVV']","[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Exelon How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:8.7% = US$2.1b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.Does Exelon Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Exelon has a similar ROE to the average in the Electric Utilities industry classification (9.1%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Exelon.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Exelon's Debt And Its 8.7% Return On EquityExelon clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.57. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Exelon may not be the best stock to buy.

Big sales days like Singles' Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and 12.12 all offer many great opportunities for shoppers to get their fill of good deals.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logoAkamai Technologies, Inc., the cloud company that powers and protects life online, shares five common shopper profiles observed during the year-end shopping period and the cyberscams they should watch out for to help consumers and businesses identify potential blind spots, and learn how to protect themselves this holiday season.""The number of cyber-attacks continues to rise and mutate all the time. In 2022, the most alarming has been the sharp increase in malicious bot attacks, where we recorded a three-fold increase of such attacks. What this means for the retail industry is the likelihood of increased credential stuffing, where attackers use lists of compromised user credentials to breach into a system and data scraping attacks, the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer,"" said Dean Houari, Director of Security Technology and Strategy, APJ, Akamai.""It is no surprise that attackers are looking to take advantage of the flurry of peak retail activity online during the extended shopping festival season since there's much to gain financially, especially in Asia that accounts for approximately 60 percent of global ecommerce sales. It's essential that both shoppers and retailers work together to learn how to watch out for scams and protect themselves,"" he continued.FIVE TYPES OF YEAR-END SHOPPERS1.     THE PLANNERYou can spot a planner miles away! Planners have their presents wrapped and ready, months before the holidays. Making and planning purchases well ahead of time, Planners often save their credit card information, log ins and other personal information on shopping sites.Story continuesMost likely to fall for: Credential StuffingDuring such attacks, attackers use lists of compromised user credentials to breach into a system via malicious bots, based on the assumption that many users reuse usernames and passwords across multiple services.Tips to protect against credential stuffing:Be wary of saving payment details on merchant websites. While this may be convenient, it can leave data vulnerable if the merchant is breached.Practice good password hygiene, by setting up different passwords for different sites. Better yet – use a password manager to set up unique, difficult-to-guess passwords.2.     THE LAST-MINUTE SCRAMBLERThe opposite of Planners, Last-Minute Shoppers often remember its sale day on 11.11 or 12.12 itself, just before the clock strikes midnight. They snag their deals, but it's always down to the wire for them!Most likely to fall for: PhishingIn their rush, the Last-Minute Shopper is likely to accidentally click on untrustworthy links and fall prey to phishing scams. What appears to be an email from a reputable retailer with a coveted discount may be fraudulent, but the last-minute shopper doesn't have time to check.With the rise of online marketplaces, this is becoming more common. Earlier this year, Singapore's most popular peer-to-peer sales platform was affected when attackers posing as legitimate buyers directed victims to a fake bank website where they would be asked to give their banking details to receive payment. This resulted in at least 72 people losing over $109,000Tips to protect against phishing Verify the validity of sites before clicking on them or providing any personal information.If emails are unsolicited, be alert to any potential errors. Do not proceed if it includes wrong information, or requests to enable macros, adjust security settings or install applications.3.     The Bargain HunterThe price point is the most significant purchase consideration for these shoppers, who would sift through various sites to get a substantial deal.Most likely to fall for: Social Engineering AttacksBargain hunters would be likely to click on spoofed emails or accept malicious extensions that function as price comparison tools.Attackers prey on buyer's eagerness for a good deal by sending them fake offers that request for their personal data on a page, even impersonating legitimate tools like Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager to compromise code and steal valuable information, impacting shopping sites.Tips to protect against social engineering attacksAlways verify the validity of the offer and the legitimacy of the sender.Use a good spam filter for emails, as a first barrier of defence against suspicious files and links.4.     The Impulse BuyerDriven solely by emotions, impulse shoppers often do not have a specific product in mind before placing an order. They often respond to time pressure to access a coveted item on a limited time offer, at a price too good to refuseMost likely to fall for: Brand Impersonation AttacksVia fraudulent links, cybercriminals impersonate popular brands, tricking victims into sharing personal information, buying contraband products, visiting a fake website, downloading malware, and more. Exacerbating these trends is social media, where attackers can easily impersonate brands, engage with customers seeking to purchase items, and request for their personal details.Tips to protect against brand impersonationScrutinize links provided in emails and be on high alert if they are not pointing to the correct location or direct to a third-party site not affiliated with the brand.If in doubt, reach out to the brand on their official channels to verify offers before clicking on any links to make payments. Make sure to check that accounts are verified.5.     The ResearcherResearchers extensively compare products and offers before purchasing. They often have various browser extensions installed on their browsers to make quick comparisons.Most likely to fall for: Extension Malware Attacks Cybercriminals hide viruses behind add-ons, which can then install adverts, gather users' browsing history, and seek login credentials by impersonating famous apps and extensions. Malicious extensions could go undetected especially if security software programs treat known extensions as trusted applications.Most recently, attackers have been using information-stealing malware like FB Stealer, which mimics the harmless and standard-looking Chrome extension Google Translate, to prey on users. Financially motivated, attackers after effectively locking a user out of their Facebook account, abuse access to ask the victim's friends for money.Tips to protect against extension malware attacksOnly install extensions from official Web stores.If permissions that extensions require even before installing seem suspicious, it'll be best not to install them.Retailers must do their part too!For a cybersafe shopping experience, retailers have a part to play as well.Attacks on popular retail behemoths in the last few years have revealed important lessons for merchants. Prevention is better than cure. Taking proactive steps to monitor potential threats and being ready to block unauthorised access and keep shoppers safe throughout their retail experience is essential.""As web traffic increases, attackers similarly increase their attacks. Case in point, malicious bot attacks tripled during Single's Day last year. These attacks could, immediately or in future, drain customer accounts, damage site functionality, and hold encrypted data ransom — all at enormous costs to businesses,"" explained Houari.""To ensure loyalty long term, retailers must make every effort to keep shopper data safe. This could include deploying a bot solution to stop credential stuffing attempts early and using password managers and multi factor authentication to secure users,"" he concluded.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Colgate-PalmoliveOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, John Kooyman, for US$200k worth of shares, at about US$77.06 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$77.78, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 13% of John Kooyman's holding. John Kooyman was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.1% of Colgate-Palmolive shares, worth about US$67m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Colgate-Palmolive Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Colgate-Palmolive insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Colgate-Palmolive insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Comcast’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast What's The Opportunity In Comcast?Comcast appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Comcast’s ratio of 28.26x is above its peer average of 11.66x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Media industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Comcast’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Comcast generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Comcast. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CMCSA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe CMCSA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CMCSA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CMCSA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Comcast.If you are no longer interested in Comcast, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Oracle could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Oracle peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Oracle.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Oracle would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 55%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 31% in total over the last three years. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 38% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Oracle is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Oracle's P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Oracle maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   4 warning signs for Oracle  you should be aware of, and 2 of them shouldn't be ignored.You might be able to find a better investment than Oracle.

We'll use ROE to examine Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Hasbro How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hasbro is:14% = US$416m ÷ US$3.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.Does Hasbro Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Hasbro has a lower ROE than the average (29%) in the Leisure industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for Hasbro.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesHasbro's Debt And Its 14% ROEHasbro clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.32. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Aon The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AonOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Eric Andersen, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$283 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$306). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 5.7% of Eric Andersen's stake.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 4.40k shares for US$1.3m. But they sold 9.65k shares for US$2.7m.

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, American Express has been relatively sluggish. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will turn around. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for American Express peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on American Express.How Is American Express' Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like American Express' to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.9% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 21% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 10.0% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.0% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we can see why American Express is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.The Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of American Express' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook is contributing to its current P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to support the share price at these levels.You always need to take note of risks, for example - American Express has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on American Express, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Pentair’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Pentair Is Pentair Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Pentair is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $59.41, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Pentair’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Pentair look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Pentair. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since PNR is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PNR for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy PNR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

The proposed price is HK$20 per share, which represents a total upfront cash payment consideration of approximately US$523 million for the 65% stake at current exchange rates.Acotec is a leader in innovative medical solutions, including drug-coated balloons (DCBs), which are used in the treatment of vascular and other diseases. In 2016, the company launched the first peripheral DCB in China after receiving approval from the National Medical Products Administration. The Acotec portfolio also includes radiofrequency ablation technologies and thrombus aspiration catheters, as well as more than 20 other products in various stages of development across a range of specialties. In the 12-month period ending June 30, 2022, Actotec generated sales of RMB 339 million (approximately US$53 million), growing 25% year-over-year in the first six months of 2022 with strong double-digit growth in each of the two years prior.""Acotec is a profitable, fast-growing company with a strong portfolio and innovative pipeline of medical technologies, and we believe this investment will generate growth opportunities for both companies,"" said Art Butcher, executive vice president and group president, MedSurg and Asia Pacific, Boston Scientific.

Vertex plans to initiate a single ascending dose clinical trial for VX-522 in people with CF in the coming weeks.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221208005977/en/This infographic provides an outline of how we envision this investigational therapy to work and is provided for illustrative purposes only. (Graphic: Business Wire)VX-522 is delivered to the lung through inhalation of a CFTR mRNA encapsulated by a lipid nanoparticle. Once delivered to the target lung cells, the mRNA is designed to produce functional copies of the CFTR protein. VX-522 is the result of an exclusive research collaboration established with Moderna in 2016.""It has been our longstanding goal to bring highly effective therapies to all people with CF. Clearance of the IND represents a pivotal turning point in reaching the remaining ~5,000 people with CF who are still waiting for a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease,"" said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., FASN, Chief Executive Officer and President, Vertex. ""The partnership with Moderna that began more than five years ago has been instrumental in achieving this milestone, and we look forward to continuing our work together.""""This partnership brings together Vertex’s scientific expertise and decades of experience in developing cystic fibrosis medicines with Moderna’s proven leadership in mRNA technologies,"" said Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel. ""Moderna’s development of a proprietary inhalable lipid nanoparticle to deliver a functional cystic fibrosis treatment to the lungs could lead to a transformational medical achievement. We are excited by the progress that has been made with the upcoming advancement of VX-522 to the clinic and look forward to our ongoing collaboration to develop treatments for the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis.""Story continuesAbout VX-522This investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) therapy aims to address the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). It is being evaluated by Vertex to treat lung disease for people living with CF who cannot benefit from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator treatments because they do not make any CFTR protein that responds to a CFTR modulator therapy. Globally, this represents a population of approximately 5,000 people living with this very rare form of the disease. The therapy is designed to deliver full length CFTR mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle via inhalation directly to the lungs. Once delivered to target airway cells, the mRNA enables the production of functional CFTR protein. Improvements in CFTR quantity and function can lead to transformative benefits for people living with CF.About the VX-522 Clinical TrialVertex plans to initiate a single dose escalation study in the coming weeks evaluating the safety and tolerability of VX-522 in people 18 years of age and older with cystic fibrosis and a CFTR genotype not responsive to CFTR modulator therapy.About the Vertex and Moderna CollaborationVX-522 is the result of an exclusive research collaboration Vertex established with Moderna in 2016 to discover and develop mRNA therapeutics for CF. Under the terms of the collaboration, Moderna leads asset identification efforts, combining its leading mRNA platform technology and mRNA delivery expertise together with Vertex's scientific experience in CF biology, functional understanding of CFTR, and Vertex’s proprietary assay platform that utilizes human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells of multiple different CF gene mutations from people with CF. Vertex leads preclinical and clinical development, regulatory and commercialization activities associated with the advancement of mRNA therapeutics that result from this collaboration and will fund all expenses related to the collaboration. Moderna is responsible for mRNA and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) process development and manufacturing. Per Vertex's agreement with Moderna, Moderna will receive certain milestone payments, as well as royalty payments from this collaboration.About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 83,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF. Beyond CF, Vertex has a robust clinical pipeline of investigational small molecule, cell and genetic therapies in other serious diseases where it has deep insight into causal human biology, including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain, type 1 diabetes and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.Founded in 1989 in Cambridge, Mass., Vertex's global headquarters is now located in Boston's Innovation District and its international headquarters is in London. Additionally, the company has research and development sites and commercial offices in North America, Europe, Australia and Latin America. Vertex is consistently recognized as one of the industry's top places to work, including 13 consecutive years on Science magazine's Top Employers list and one of Fortune’s Best Workplaces in Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals and Best Workplaces for Women.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Vertex Pharmaceuticals certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 52% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 52% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.1% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.0% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Our examination of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Having said that, be aware  Vertex Pharmaceuticals is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.You might be able to find a better investment than Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

Pre-clinical data indicate that INCA033989 can alter disease course by reducing mutant CALR allele burden and thus may be an efficacious and safe treatment in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). This research was featured in the Plenary Scientific Session (Abstract #6. Session: Hematology Disease Topics &amp; Pathways: Research, Diseases, Therapies, Myeloid Malignancies) at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, held December 10-13, 2022, in New Orleans and virtually1.""As a pioneer in the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), having brought the first FDA-approved treatment to patients, we are excited to have the opportunity to share details of our latest research,"" said Dash Dhanak, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Incyte. ""We continue to apply our deep understanding of the complex biology of MPNs to expand treatment options for patients and the work on INCA033989 presented today reflects our progress toward this goal. We look forward to continuing to advance the development of this potential new treatment and to initiating clinical trials for INCA033989 next year.""Story continuesCALR mutations are responsible for disease development in approximately 25-35%2,3 of patients with MF and ET – two common types of MPNs. INCA033989 binds with high affinity to mutant CALR and inhibits oncogenesis, the process of cells becoming cancerous, in cells expressing this oncoprotein. As described in our presentation, INCA033989 potently antagonizes CALR oncogenic function, resulting in selective inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling only in CALR-mutated cells with no effect on normal, non-oncogenic cells. This selectivity of action with INCA033989 results in the specific killing of tumor cells harboring the mutation and is suggestive of the potential to alter the course of disease in patients with CALR-mutant MF and ET.""Diseases like myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia are often difficult to understand and treat, and unique approaches are necessary to develop effective and safe therapies,"" said Srdan Verstovsek, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. ""As a leader in the field, Incyte is uniquely positioned to develop novel medicines for these rare blood cancers, and this research provides strong rationale for the continued investigation and clinical advancement of INCA033989 – a novel treatment approach that targets CALR mutations.""More information regarding the congress and the more than 50 abstracts from Incyte’s oncology portfolio being featured at the meeting is available on the ASH website: https://www.hematology.org/meetings/annual-meeting.About Myeloproliferative NeoplasmsMyeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a closely related group of blood cancers in which the bone marrow functions abnormally. The bone marrow is where the body’s blood cells are made. MPNs are progressive blood cancers that can strike anyone at any age, but they are more common in older adults. Estimates of the prevalence of MPNs vary, but analysis of claims data suggests there may be as many as 200,000 people in the U.S. living with the most prevalent MPNs: myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia4.About LIMBERIncyte is a leader in the discovery and development of therapies for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The Leadership In MPNs and GVHD BEyond Ruxolitinib (LIMBER) program is designed to evaluate multiple monotherapy and combination strategies to improve and expand treatments for patients with MPNs and GVHD. The program currently has three key areas of focus: development of a new, once-daily formulation of ruxolitinib; ruxolitinib-based combinations with new targets such as PI3Kδ, BET and ALK2; and new therapeutic options such as mutant CALR.About IncyteIncyte is a Wilmington, Delaware-based, global biopharmaceutical company focused on finding solutions for serious unmet medical needs through the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Waste Management share price has climbed 94% in five years, easily topping the market return of 41% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 3.2% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Waste Management While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Waste Management managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Waste Management the TSR over the last 5 years was 112%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 3.2% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 16% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

While that's a very decent purchase to our minds, it was proportionally a bit modest, boosting their holding by just 2.2%. View our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Cincinnati FinancialNotably, that recent purchase by Dirk Debbink is the biggest insider purchase of Cincinnati Financial shares that we've seen in the last year. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$106). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months Cincinnati Financial insiders were buying shares, but not selling. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Cincinnati Financial insiders own about US$483m worth of shares (which is 2.9% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Cincinnati Financial Insiders?The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Cincinnati Financial. Looks promising!

After accounting for the recent loss, the US$5.5m worth of shares they purchased is now worth US$6.0m, suggesting a good return on their investment.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp for US$4.8m worth of shares, at about US$75.26 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$81.45. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the General Electric insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 73.54k shares worth US$5.5m. But they sold 1.44k shares for US$107k. In total, General Electric insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does General Electric Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$218m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Electric Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded General Electric shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, General Electric insiders feel good about the company's future. Of course, the future is what matters most.

141,f4300841-af2d-32a9-ba41-c9f8daa6747e,GE,2022-12-12,Are Investors Undervaluing General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) By 41%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-general-electric-company-120209975.html,1670846529,STORY,['GE'],"[Does the December share price for General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for General Electric Is General Electric Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.39bUS$7.22bUS$8.43bUS$9.32bUS$10.1bUS$10.7bUS$11.2bUS$11.7bUS$12.1bUS$12.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 10.59%Est @ 8.01%Est @ 6.20%Est @ 4.93%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$5.0kUS$6.1kUS$6.6kUS$6.8kUS$6.7kUS$6.6kUS$6.4kUS$6.1kUS$5.8kUS$5.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$62bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.0%) = US$197bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$197b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$88bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$150b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$81.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.153. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For General Electric, we've compiled three fundamental items you should look at:Financial Health: Does GE have a healthy balance sheet?

145,859f8412-ed6e-3bd4-96ad-61e5512315ef,PG,2022-12-12,Our 7 Top Consumer Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-consumer-stock-picks-185518697.html,1670525718,STORY,"['TJX', 'KR', 'UL', 'PG', 'PEP', 'PM']","[While household sentiment regarding financial expenditures slipping to near all-time recorded lows, the idea of top consumer stock picks for 2023 might seem unusually risky. Obviously, though, we no longer live in a society where individual families tended to their own needs. Rather, we outsource many services, choosing instead to align career paths with our abilities and/or talents.That’s a complicated way of saying that consumer stock picks for 2023 remain relevant, even under current circumstances. With very few people being their own farmers, tailors and dentists, if you want to live in the modern world, you’re going to have to open your wallet. And certain companies and industries enjoy inelastic demand, making them indelible. While the defensive consumer sector may be boring, boring is good ahead of a potential recession. Therefore, these are the top consumer stock picks for 2023.PEPPepsiCo$183.42ULUnilever$50.65CLColgate-Palmolive$77.85PMPhilip Morris$101.55KRKroger$47.36TJXTJX Companies$79.19PGProcter &amp; Gamble$151.26InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockOne of the classic ideas among the top consumer stock picks for 2023, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) may enjoy a recessionary-resistant business. Back during the Great Recession, Pepsi’s biggest rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed attention from some analysts for its resilient financial profile. Where both brands share similarities is that they facilitate the cheap pick-me-up thesis.As scientific studies demonstrate, sugary sodas attract consumers because of their addictive ingredients. “In regular sodas, the sugar causes dopamine releases in the brain, stimulating pleasure centers,” stated Natalie Stephens for the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.Moving forward, should we encounter either a domestic or global recession, it’s very possible that people will seek out escapism. A dopamine release may be just what the doctor ordered, making PEP one of the cynically oriented top consumer stock picks for 2023.Story continuesIronically, Pepsi is no slouch in the financial department. Although some of its core metrics could use some work, it enjoys excellent profit margins, as well as return on equity. Therefore, it enjoys the same qualities that made its rival a big hit during the last recession.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comAmong the most diverse consumer stock picks for 2023, Unilever (NYSE:UL) benefits from several recognizable brands. On the (literal) consumption angle, the company’s Ben &amp; Jerry’s line of ice cream products is always a treat. In addition, Unilever commands significant strengths in the personal and beauty care segment with brands like Vaseline, Axe, and Dove.Fundamentally, Unilever also spearheaded initiatives designed to foster social equity. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company report, people are willing to pay a small premium for responsibly sourced products. Given that Unilever’s pricing isn’t outrageously excessive compared to industry norms, management’s emphasis on doing good can be profitable. After all, millennials and Generation Z care strongly about various social issues – and they represent the future of consumption.On the financial front, Unilever attracts investors because of its present zero-debt profile. This gives the organization greater flexibility during rough times. Therefore, UL represents one of the top consumer stock picks for 2023.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAccording to a study of common fears in the context of mental conditions, dental phobia apparently caused the most stress among survey participants. It’s not surprising and it also provides a cynical catalyst for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). Therefore, it’s a name to consider when assessing consumer stock picks for 2023.During the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, people avoided health-related offices for fear of contracting Covid-19. Of course, the global health crisis provided a readymade excuse to avoid the dentist. Indeed, The Washington Post wrote an op-ed about the phenomenon.However, another pandemic – an economic one – might convince people to once again avoid the dentist’s chair. This time, a combination of high prices and natural revulsion of the practice may lead to missed appointments. Still, people aren’t going to let their dental health go just because of their phobias and financial pressures. Therefore, I anticipate Colgate-Palmolive to be one of the top consumer stock picks for 2023 out of sheer necessity (and perhaps desperation).Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comThough ranking among the more controversial names for consumer stock picks for 2023, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could see surprising demand in the months ahead. Already, the tobacco giant proved its worth. Since the start of the year, PM stock gained over 6% of market value. While not an astounding performance by any means, it’s a whole lot better than what the S&amp;P 500 put out.Currently, the benchmark equities index slipped 18% on a year-to-date basis.While global smoking prevalence declined since 1990, certain circumstances can change this dynamic. Most prominently, the specter of a worldwide economic slowdown can contribute to increased stress levels. In turn, this dynamic could spark increased prevalence as a means of escapism.Also, it’s worthwhile to note that many have turned to vaping for exercising their personal liberties. This too should help pad Philip Morris’ bottom line, making it an intriguing idea for consumer stock picks for 2023.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the most obvious idea among consumer stock picks for 2023, Kroger (NYSE:KR) fundamentally gets on this list for addressing critical demand. As a general rule, Everydayhealth.com notes that humans need a minimum of 1,200 calories daily to stay healthy. If you don’t get that minimum, bad things happen. Therefore, KR also represents a cynical trade.On a less macabre note, Kroger also benefits from being near the bottom of the trade-down effect. When consumers face financial pressures, they don’t necessarily stop all discretionary spending. Instead, they keep trading down to lower-cost alternatives until they reach equilibrium. While cheaper competitors to Kroger exist, they’re usually dollar-discount stores: not exactly the healthiest choice.Further, you can make the case that KR offers an undervalued prospect among top consumer stock picks for 2023. Currently, the market prices Kroger at 11 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 16.8 times.TJX Companies (TJX)a person carrying several shopping bagsSource: ShutterstockBack during the middle of the Covid-19 crisis, the Washington Post published an op-ed referring to the then landscape as a “pajama moment.” With white-collar workers operating remotely, it didn’t really matter what folks were wearing. Even during teleconferencing sessions, as long as you look presentable from the waist up, no problems materialized.However, this dynamic probably won’t last forever, which may bode well for TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). Specializing in off-price apparel, TJX may gain relevance as companies recall their workers back to the office. According to Resume Builder, 90% of companies surveyed will require their employees to return to corporate campuses at least part of the week starting in 2023.If folks have to go back to their cubicles, they’re going to need to upgrade their wardrobe. However, with the personal saving rate dramatically plunging since April 2020, discretionary funds may be running lean. Therefore, TJX would look much more compelling than normal, making it one of the consumer stock picks for 2023.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comUsually, I like to go for a speculative company with strong growth potential with the last idea. However, for this list of top consumer stock picks for 2023, I’m going to go boring with Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). Why not? When you’re going defensive, you don’t want to get too wild. With PG, you get a dependable investment you can trust.As a household goods giant, it’s difficult to imagine that Procter &amp; Gamble won’t regain its footing. Sure, its shares slipped nearly 8% YTD. However, if a recession materializes, available consumer funds will redirect toward the essentials, with the remainder (if any) moved toward discretionary purchases. Stated differently, Procter &amp; Gamble enjoys inelastic demand. No matter what happens in the economy, people will purchase basic everyday goods.Further, in the trailing month, PG gained nearly 10%, which suggests that the market is catching on. With economic pressures building, it may be time to consider this oldie but goodie.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The experts in the field of investing are the brokers.We believe that investors should include broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines, Delek US Holdings, Builders FirstSource, Asbury Automotive and Foot Locker in their watchlist.Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them. They have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors.To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Consequently, the opinion of brokers should act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Movement of Earnings Estimates: An Invaluable PointerSince brokers follow the stocks in their coverage minutely, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to immediately influence the price of the stock.Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons — favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Story continuesTo take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Ignore Top line at Your Own PerilTo design a winning strategy, it is not prudent to consider only the bottom line only. In fact, according to some market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than a mere earnings beat under some circumstances. Therefore, to make our strategy full-proof, one needs to address top-line concerns as well. We have considered the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric, for screening stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Eaton’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton What's The Opportunity In Eaton?Eaton appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Eaton’s ratio of 27.46x is above its peer average of 18.21x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Electrical industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Eaton’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Eaton generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Eaton's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 46%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ETN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ETN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ETN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ETN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Eaton you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Eaton, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

AFL, Unum Group UNM, Trupanion TRUP, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF.Industry: Accident and Health InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027246/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-thriving-accident-health-insurance-industryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac Inc., Unum Group, Trupanion, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry in the coming days. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies that provide workers’ compensation insurance, largely to employers operating in hazardous industries. These players offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay.Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state-run workers’ compensation funds, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, thus, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 3% to $48.3 billion in 2022 based on revenues.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will again induce pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. Per Willis Towers Watson’s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey, workers’ compensation witnessed a slight price reduction in 2021.Per the survey, pricing at workers' compensation could be down 2% to up 4% in 2022.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #19, which places it in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has moved up 3.9% in a year.We present a few stocks one can buy or retain, given their business advancement endeavors. But before that it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Accident and Health Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 16.1% in the past year against the Finance sector’s decline of 12.4% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decrease of 18.1% over the same period.Current ValuationOn the basis of a trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.56X compared with the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s 5.49X and the sector’s 3.41X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.6X, as low as 0.58X and at the median of 1.15X.5 Accident &amp; Health Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye OnWe are presenting one Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, one Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock and three Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks from the Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sherwin-Williams. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Sherwin-Williams. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sherwin-Williams' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sherwin-Williams. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 6.3% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Sherwin-Williams Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$182m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NASDAQ:PEP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PepsiCo. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PepsiCo. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PepsiCo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PepsiCo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that PepsiCo, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$386m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced positive new and updated data from a Phase 1 and pivotal Phase 2 trial (ELM-1 and ELM-2) evaluating investigational odronextamab in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). These included first data from a Phase 2 cohort of patients naïve to prior CAR-T therapy (CAR-T naïve), as well as updated data from a dose expansion cohort of a Phase 1 trial in patients who had progressed on CAR-T therapy (post-CAR-T). The results were presented in an oral session at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in New Orleans, LA, and will form the basis of planned submissions to regulatory authorities in 2023, including to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Odronextamab is an investigational bispecific antibody designed to bridge CD20 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.""People with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma face a disease that often relapses and becomes more aggressive each time it returns, leaving doctors with a shrinking set of treatment options,"" said Won Seog Kim, M.D., Ph.D., Samsung Medical Center and Division of Hematology-Oncology at Sungkyunkwan University, in Seoul, South Korea, and trial investigator. ""The Phase 1 and pivotal Phase 2 odronextamab data demonstrated deep and durable responses that were consistent in patients who progress after CAR-T therapy, which is important as they have particularly difficult-to-treat disease and no effective treatment options. Coupled with its overall safety profile, these clinically important results reinforce the potential of odronextamab to treat this aggressive blood cancer.""Story continuesAt ASH, efficacy in R/R DLBCL was presented from 130 CAR-T naïve patients in a Phase 2 cohort (includes those with an opportunity for assessment at 12 weeks; median follow-up: 21 months, range: 3 to 30 months) and 31 CAR-T experienced patients in a dose expansion cohort of a Phase 1 trial (median follow-up: 24 months, range: 3 to 38.5 months). All patients had received at least two prior therapies, including a CD20 antibody and alkylating agent. Patients were treated with a step-up regimen of odronextamab in the first cycle to help mitigate the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) before receiving the full dose of 160 mg. The step-up regimen was modified part way through the trial to further mitigate CRS. Results as assessed by independent central review were as follows:Among CAR-T naïve patients, a 49% objective response rate (ORR), with 31% achieving a complete response (CR). The median duration of complete response (mDOCR) was 18 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10 months to not evaluable [NE]).Among post-CAR-T patients, a 48% ORR, with 32% achieving a CR. The mDOCR was not reached (95% CI: 2 months to NE).Among 140 patients in the Phase 2 cohort assessed for safety, adverse events (AE) occurred in 99% of patients, with 79% being ≥Grade 3. The most common AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients were CRS (55%), anemia (42%), pyrexia (39%), neutropenia (28%) and hypokalemia (20%). Discontinuations due to an AE occurred in 10% of patients, and there were 5 deaths due to pneumonia (n=3), COVID-19 (n=1) and pseudomonal sepsis (n=1) where the relationship to odronextamab treatment could not be excluded.CRS was the most common AE, of which 64% of cases were mild (Grade 1) and all resolved within a median time of 2 days (range: 1-133 days). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS cases, and the incidence of Grade 2 or higher cases was reduced with the modified step-up regimen when compared to the original (original regimen n=67 vs. step-up regimen n=73; Grade 2: 18% vs. 14%, Grade 3: 7.5% vs. 1%).Based on these data, the OLYMPIA Phase 3 development program investigating odronextamab in earlier stages of the disease is in the process of being initiated. In the U.S., odronextamab has been granted Fast Track Designation for DLBCL by the FDA. In the European Union, Orphan Drug Designation was granted for DLBCL by the European Medicines Agency. Odronextamab is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Investor Webcast InformationRegeneron will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to share updates on the company's hematology portfolio on Wednesday, December 14 at 8:30 AM ET.

The report, which harnesses insights from more than 20 million clinical drug tests over 10 years, shows that while progress has been made in the last decade of drug misuse, patients of all ages and both sexes are still at risk.Quest Diagnostics Health Trends: Drug Misuse in America 2022To access the Health Trends report, visit Quest Diagnostics Newsroom - Health Trends®.The findings reveal that while illicit fentanyl now causes most of overdose deaths, prescription drug misuse involving opioids and other controlled medications taken by patients under the care of a physician continues at a troubling rate. In 2021, nearly half (49%) of people tested showed evidence of prescription drug misuse, compared to 60% in 2012.Additional key findings over the past 10 years include:Polysubstance use, or drug mixing, has increased. In 2021, 52% of drug tests showed evidence of drug mixing, a relative increase of 58% from 33% in 2012.Use of amphetamines has surged 5-fold. In 2021, 9.2% of patients tested were positive for amphetamines, compared to 1.8% in 2012.Though individuals of all ages misused medications and illicit drugs at high rates, younger individuals (ages 18-34 years) were more likely to show signs of misuse.Of those tested, female patients were more likely to use pain-and-anxiety reducing prescription medications, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, while male patients had higher rates of illicit drugs, such as cocaine.""This year's Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® Report underscores the deeply entrenched pattern of prescription drug misuse,"" said report co-author Harvey W. Kaufman, M.D., Senior Medical Director and Head of the Health Trends Research Program for Quest Diagnostics. ""While today's policy debates about the drug crisis focus largely on reducing illicit fentanyl use, our nationally representative laboratory data is a stark reminder that even patients under a physician's care can be at significant risk of drug-related harms.""Story continues""As a pain specialist, it is beyond frustrating to see similar patterns of dangerous drug mixing and outright misuse today as those observed 10 years ago,"" said board-certified pain expert and report co-author Jeffrey Gudin, M.D., Senior Medical Advisor, Drug Monitoring, Quest Diagnostics. ""As providers and policy makers reflect on the CDC's new opioid prescribing guidelines, our laboratory data demonstrates that the medical community must do more to create a truly preventive care model for identifying early signs of prescription drug misuse, similar to screening programs for cancer, heart disease and diabetes.""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its opioid prescribing guidelines to improve the safety and effectiveness of pain care, including with prescription opioids. Among other recommendations, the guidance states that clinicians should consider clinical drug testing (toxicology testing) before staring opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy when there is risk of overdose due to mixing with other controlled substances. The CDC also recommends that ""clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in testing and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about patients.""""While our laboratory data does not provide insights based on racial or ethnic characteristics, it does clearly demonstrate that high rates of drug misuse are found in patients of all ages, both sexes and varying kinds of commercial and public health plan coverage,"" Dr. Gudin said. ""Put simply, patients from all walks of life are at risk of misuse. These findings bolster the CDC's recommendation that providers aim to reduce bias, such as by applying uniform standards in drug testing.""In recent years, the prescription opioid crisis has morphed into an illicit fentanyl crisis, with fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, responsible for more than 70% of all overdose deaths today. Prescription opioids are still widely misused: as many as 13,500 overdose deaths were due to prescription opioids in 2021, versus approximately 16,000 in 2012. Polysubstance misuse, such as mixing one or more prescribed controlled medications, is highly prevalent, while deaths from stimulants such as amphetamines have climbed.An estimated 108,000 deaths were due to drug overdose in the 12-months ending June 2022.For more information on clinical drug testing and different types of tests, please visit Clinical.QuestDiagnostics.com/WhyClinicalDrugTesting.Quest Diagnostics Health Trends studies are performed on aggregate deidentified laboratory data in compliance with applicable privacy regulations and the company's strict privacy policies, and follow procedures approved by the WCG Institutional Review Board.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Cisco Systems, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$14b ÷ (US$93b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.7% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cisco Systems compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Cisco Systems here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Cisco Systems Tell Us?Cisco Systems has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 68%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 33% less capital than it was five years ago. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesOur Take On Cisco Systems' ROCEIn the end, Cisco Systems has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 47% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Cisco Systems can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?
