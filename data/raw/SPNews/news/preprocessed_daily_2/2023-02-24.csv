Here’s what they said.For Nomadic Freelancers, Schwab Makes Every ATM a Free ATMOne of the best accounts for freelancers isn’t a trendy new upstart that exists only on a computer screen, but an industry standard-bearer with decades of history and global name recognition.Tom Eskey, founder of GarageGymRevisited.com, first opened his Charles Schwab checking account nine years ago, and he thinks the rise of remote work and the gig economy have only solidified its standing as his No. 1 pick for freelancers like him.“When I first started working online, I took the nomadic plunge that a lot of freelancers take,” Eskey said. “In a completely new city and state, I would have to drive close to half an hour to find an ATM for my old bank.”He chose Schwab because it supported the cash-on-the-go lifestyle of a work-from-anywhere freelancer.“The account continues to offer fully refundable ATM fees for every ATM in the world,” said Eskey, who also noted that it’s a fee-free account with no balance minimums or foreign transaction fees. It even pays a modest interest yield.Story continuesBy comparison, Ally Bank refunds just $10 in ATM fees per month. Axos reimburses up to $8.“I have recommended Schwab to a lot of freelancer friends and I think it is the ideal account for the newly nomadic freelancer,” said Esky.Grasshopper Checks Just About Every Box for Independent ContractorsPerry Zheng, founder and CEO of the real estate investment software firm Cash Flow Marketplace, recommends a newer player that debuted as a digital bank in 2019.“If you want to open a checking account as a freelancer, Grasshopper is an ideal choice,” said Zheng. “It’s digitally inclusive, charges no monthly fees, and has no transaction limits.”Take Our Poll: What Do You Plan To Use Your Tax Refund For?Privately owned and headquartered in New York City, Grasshopper offers unique hybrid accounts that can serve as jacks of all trades for freelancers. Its checking account pays 1.51% APY like a savings account and gives unlimited 1% cash back on transactions like a credit card — all with the debit, ACH transfer, check-writing and direct-deposit functionality of a checking account.It also doubles as a business account, with features like automatic bookkeeping, invoice-sending and cash-flow management, which together allow Grasshopper to serve as an all-in-one account for many freelancers.New to the Freelance Game? Lili Can Be Your One-Stop ShopMoses Aremu, head of marketing at Lonelyaxe, also recommends Grasshopper for established freelancers, but he urges new arrivals to unify their financial services under one roof with a close competitor.“Lili business checking is ideal for newbie freelancers because it provides free expense management tools and efficient tax tools for debit cards,” said Aremu. “As a freelancer who has successfully run a copywriting business for over two years, the best bank accounts for freelancers should be easy to access, charge low fees, and aid in recording and managing business finances separate from personal finances.”Lili does all of those things and more by unifying banking, taxes and invoicing in one program. It has no minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees. Its comprehensive Lili Pro option costs $9 a month, but even the free version offers expense categorization and quarterly expense reports. Its Visa business debit card is free, as is $200 in overdraft protection, a suite of tax optimizer tools, a write-off tracker and DIY accounting tools.Do It All From One Platform With Bluevine Business CheckingShawn Hill, owner of The Grilling Dad, turned his cooking passion into a freelance profession — and he joined several other independent contractors in recommending Bluevine business checking as a can’t-go-wrong account for the self-employed.“What’s great is that there are no monthly fees and no minimum balances, so a lean month isn’t going to put you out of pocket,” said Hill. “They also allow unlimited transactions, which is really helpful. Another perk is the potential for accruing high-yield interest on your account.”Bluevine currently pays 2% on your balance without any of the constraints of a savings account — and you can use the app to pay vendors, share access and organize sub-accounts. There are truly zero fees, including for wire transfers and QuickBooks integration and exports.“The platform itself is easy to use and it’s laid out in a way that is simple and straightforward to manage,” said Hill. “You can organize your finances in the way that’s best for you and your specific business.”More From GOBankingRates10 Best New Items Coming to Dollar Tree in 2023Make the Most of Your Bank and Your MoneyBuild Your Credit Score with These Simple Strategies8 Steps To Improve Your Finances in One YearThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Best Bank Accounts for Freelancers]"

It is known as the ""buy high and sell higher"" theory. No doubt, it's a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron's All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Coca Cola Femsa, Nucor andEncore Wire have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Here are three of the 19 stocks:Coca Cola Femsa produces, markets, and distributes soft drinks throughout the metropolitan area of Mexico City. Coca Cola Femsa has a Momentum Score of B. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for KOF is 33.6%, on average.Story continuesNucor is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck, and cold-finished bars in the United States. Nucor has a Momentum Score of B. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for NUE is 7.8%, on average.Encore Wire is a low-cost manufacturer of copper electrical building wire and cable. Encore Wire has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for WIRE is 146.9%, on average.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

The new mill will have an annual capacity of 3 million tons per year, and employ as many as 2,000 construction workers during the building phase and approximately 800 full-time teammates when it is fully operational.""We remain incredibly excited about our Nucor Steel West Virginia mill and its advanced capabilities that will expand our ability to provide our customers with the cleanest and highest-quality steel products, particularly for demanding automotive and construction applications,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""The Midwest and Northeast consume half the sheet steel in the United States. This transformative project will provide customers in these high-demand regions with more sustainable sheet steel, create long-term value for our shareholders and fuel additional growth for Nucor.""Nucor now expects a net cash outlay of approximately $3.1 billion for the West Virginia sheet mill, up from $2.7 billion when the project was first announced in September 2021. The revised $3.1 billion estimate is net of $275 million in cash proceeds received from the State of West Virginia for costs related to the Apple Grove site location. Factors contributing to the increased capital cost include general inflation, the acquisition of additional property and equipment, and expanded port and rail infrastructure requirements.To date, Nucor Steel West Virginia has received all required state permits and is working to secure federal permits this spring. Construction of the new sheet mill is expected to take 2-3 years once all the necessary permit approvals have been received, and Nucor Steel West Virginia is actively hiring teammates to grow its team in the state.Story continuesWhen operational, the new mill will be the most capable sheet mill in the region with a significantly lower carbon footprint than its competitors. It will be equipped to produce 84-inch sheet products, and among other features, will include a 76-inch tandem cold mill and two galvanizing lines capable of producing advanced high-end automotive and construction grades. Nucor Steel West Virginia will have a freight advantage and unmatched capabilities that will enable the continued expansion of Nucor's high-quality, low-carbon steel product offerings.""It's been an exciting first year for our team in West Virginia. We cannot thank the state's federal, state and local officials enough for their support and help with this project,"" said John Farris, Vice President and General Manager of Nucor Steel West Virginia. ""We appreciate the warm welcome we have received and working with these officials to recruit the talent we will need to build an amazing Nucor Steel West Virginia team.""About Nucor Nucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

HOLX.Industry: Medical InstrumentsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2058036/3-medical-instruments-stocks-to-buy-amid-improving-industry-trendsThe Medical Instruments industry has witnessed a significant transformation in the nature of business lately, leading to increased investment in R&amp;D for the development of cutting-edge technologies. The dynamic nature of the healthcare crisis over the past two and a half years has further altered the industry landscape, putting robotic and remote medical services in the limelight.Despite the reopening of the economy, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, industry watchers are still unable to gauge the magnitude of economic revival due to the emergence of new COVID strains in selective parts of the world from time to time.The just-reported fourth-quarter result of a number of medical instrument companies confirmed a gradual rebound in their base businesses through the latter half of 2022. However, the industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Edwards Lifesciences, IDEXX Laboratories and Hologic, Inc. have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&amp;D) in therapeutic areas. This FDA-regulated industry comprises an endless number of products, starting from transcatheter valves to orthopedic products to imaging equipment and robotics. Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&amp;D.Story continuesAmong the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments IndustryBusiness Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macro-economic situation, the IMF came up with its January 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. The update noted that global growth might slightly slow down from 3.4% in 2022, to 2.9% in 2023, then again rebound to 3.1% in 2024. IMF specifically addressed the ongoing tightening financial conditions in most regions, staffing shortages,Russia’s continued aggression, all of which have been weighing heavily on the medical instrument outlook despite the decline in COVID-19 severity. Per IMF, through 2023, inflation could remain stubbornly high, with continued labor market tightness and growing wage pressures requiring tighter monetary policies. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand.Overall, the Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.M&amp;A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) trend. In fact, various reports suggest that M&amp;A has been the key catalyst in the U.S. MedTech space of late. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation.The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. Among the significant deals of recent times, in December 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson completed the $16.6-billion mammoth acquisition of Abiomed. In February 2023, Abbott announced its plans to acquire Cardiovascular Systems, a medical device company with advanced atherectomy system used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease. The same month, Globus Medical announced its plans to acquire the San-Diego based spine technology firm, NuVasive Inc., in an all-stock deal valued at around $3.1 billion.Meanwhile, a MedTech Dive report of January 2023 revealed that MedTech players are expected to demonstrate a slow start to 2023 in terms on M&amp;A. Yet, the experts say that despite higher interest rates and a volatile stock market, there are signs that strategic M&amp;As are poised to rebound.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%.Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Good ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

(NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 3rd of April to $0.57, which will be 1.8% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of $0.56. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 69.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.59, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.24. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.5% a year over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Walmart has grown earnings per share at 5.6% per year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.We Really Like Walmart's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

(NYSE:WMT) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 21, 2023Operator: Greetings. Welcome to Walmart's Fiscal Year 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin.Steph Wissink: Thank you, and welcome to our Q4 fiscal '23 earnings conference call. Joining me today from Walmart's home office in Bentonville, our CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. We'll follow a similar format to prior calls, where Doug and John David will share their thoughts on the quarter, year and year ahead. Following, we'll open the call to your questions. For the Q&amp;A portion, we've asked our segment CEOs to join, including John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International and Kath McLay from Sam's Club. Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. We are now ready to begin. Doug, over to you.Doug McMillon: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're excited about our momentum. The team delivered a strong finish to the year. And as our results in the last two quarters show we acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year. We built momentum in the third quarter, and that continues. We're well positioned to start this fiscal year. For fiscal '23, we added $38 billion in sales globally, and we crossed $600 billion in revenue for the first time in our company's history. Globally, e-commerce now represents more than $80 billion in sales and over 13% of our total sales. Walmart U.S. grew sales by more than $27 billion. International had another strong year with sales and profit growth of about 9%, excluding divestitures, restructuring and currency.Story continuesAnd Sam's Club U.S. grew sales by more than $10 billion as we delivered double-digit comp growth for the third consecutive year with membership count at a record high and strong growth in membership income. All three segments have momentum. We're grateful to John, Judith, Kath and their teams for how they're leading these businesses and showing results. The holidays were strong for us, from Thanksgiving to Christmas to Diwali to Singles Day, our teams were ready. We had aggressive plans and we delivered. Around the world, the teams leaned into our food and consumables strength, taking share in places like the U.S. and Canada and delivered a good experience for customers and members in general merchandise. They drove sales and landed the seasons in a very good inventory position when it was all said and done.We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year, which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number. And they did it while improving in-stock levels. I'm impressed with how they brought it all together, and want to highlight our store club and supply chain associates who handled a lot of volume to make this happen. As we navigated the short term, we also advanced our strategic priorities. Big picture, our strategy is simple. It's to bring our purpose to life for those we have the privilege to serve. We're a people-led, tech-powered omni-channel retailer that's dedicated to helping people save money and live a better life. That's who we are. Why do we exist? It's to help people save money and live better.How do we do it? By being people led with clear values, a unique culture and tech powered. We're a people business focused on customers, members and associates. We're constantly adjusting to put the right combination of wages, benefits and education in place so that our people can build lifelong careers and achieve their full potential. You can start your career assembling bicycles and end up leading all of our U.S. stores. You can start as a cashier and become a truck driver. You can start unloading trucks in a DC and grow to oversee an automated system moving freight through that DC. We provide opportunity even as we continue to innovate through technology and prepare our business and workforce for the future. One of the things I have always appreciated about this company is that it's naturally hedged.If customers want more of something and less of something else, we shift our inventory. If the economy is strong, our customers have more money, and that's great. If things are tougher, they come to us for value. With today's inflation, we're continuing to see that happen. We're gaining share across income cohorts, including at the higher end which made up nearly half of the gains we saw in the U.S. again this quarter. And we're also capturing a greater share of wallet at Sam's Club in the U.S. with both mid- and higher-income shoppers. Our goal is for the experience they're having in our stores and clubs combined with our current capabilities for pickup, delivery and membership to result in them choosing us even as inflation eventually subsides.As we plan this new fiscal year, we've anticipated stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables in particular, which will have some mixed impact. We'll stay focused on general merchandise and earn sales in those categories to offset that impact as much as possible. When we think about our business today compared to what it was during prior economic downturns, we now have a more compelling offer, a true omni-channel experience that makes us optimistic that more higher income families will continue shopping with us across categories because we have pickup, delivery and membership. And we're improving in categories like apparel and home. Our recently remodeled U.S. stores have a focus in those areas, and the early response from customers is promising.Niloo / Shutterstock.comWe're also improving our e-commerce assortment and presentation in those categories. We've always been known for great prices. And because of the work we've done around pickup and delivery from stores, clubs and expanded assortment through FCs, we're increasingly known for the convenience we offer. In fact, our U.S. customer feedback showed strength in price and convenience. Our reputation for price remains strong, and our score for convenience has risen to nearly the same level. Our Walmart Plus members recognize our strength for convenience even more than the average customer. As it relates to our customer or member value proposition, we continue to have a strength with respect to value, while we're expanding choice by growing our assortment on Walmart.com and we're improving as it relates to experience.Being an at-scale omni-channel retailer creates unique opportunities to innovate in the area of experience. That includes products like scan &amp; go at Sam's Club and a newer in-house conversational AI platform enabling a voice and chat capability being used by more than 50 million customers and an average of 1 million associates across the U.S., Mexico, Canada and Chile. We're driving a lot of change inside our company. We know where to tap the brakes on cost and inventory, but our focus is more on the gas pedal with respect to our strategic improvements related to assortment growth and our customer member experience. We'll keep shaping the business model by scaling our newer mutually reinforcing businesses in areas like marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising.It's exciting to see our global advertising business grow to $2.7 billion for the year we just completed. That's nearly 30% growth. Over the last three years, while our frontline focus was on navigating the pandemic and inflation, we still launched and started scaling new complementary businesses using the technology and expertise we developed over time. You can see this in some of our recent announcements. The partnership we announced with Salesforce to help scale local fulfillment and delivery solutions for customers on their e-commerce platform is a good example, or our new Walmart business e-commerce site is another, where we're helping small and medium-sized businesses and nonprofits save money and spend less on purchasing the items they need every day.Our fast-growing businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe announced a full separation, which will allow both companies to focus on their own growth paths independently and help unlock value for shareholders. Flipkart has continued to strengthen its market leadership position in e-commerce and is entering this year with good momentum. PhonePe also announced the closing in January of the initial tranche of a fund raise that values the business at $12 billion pre money. This is more than double the previous valuation just two years ago. And our Sam's Club U.S. team announced expansion plans that will have us opening more than 30 new clubs across the country over the next several years in addition to a multiyear plan to invest in and modernize our supply chain, especially in the U.S. I'll wrap up my comments today by saying thank you to our associates.I'm grateful for how they continue to step up for our customers and members, and I'm impressed by their creativity and resilience. We've worked through a lot of the operational stress in our business from last year, and we made progress on strategic initiatives as we did it, and we're doing it in a way that's uniquely Walmart. John David, over to you.John David Rainey: Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to wrap up the year. We're pleased with how we finished the year. Our team demonstrated our agility and responsiveness to overcome the operational challenges from supply chain disruptions, excess inventory and the shift in our merchandise mix. For the full year, enterprise sales on a constant currency basis grew more than 7%, and we surpassed $600 billion in annual sales for the first time. Adjusted EPS declined 2.6% for the year. Our performance in Q4 was better than our expectations due to sales upside and good expense leverage. Constant currency sales grew 8% with strength across all segments, including strong performance throughout the holiday season.Walmart U.S. comps increased 8.3%, including 17% growth in e-commerce with a combination of pricing due in part to inflation and share gains. Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 12.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco. And constant currency sales in Walmart International increased 5.5%, led by Walmex. As I discuss our profitability, it's important to note the reorganization and restructuring charges within the International segment affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q4 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items. Gross margins were down 83 basis points, largely resulting from additional markdowns taken to address carryover inventory balances, mix headwinds and underlying inflation in our cost structure.With strong sales growth in the quarter, we levered SG&amp;A expenses by 89 basis points. Taking all this together, adjusted operating income grew nearly 7%. Adjusted EPS of $1.71 was better than we expected going into the quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.32. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.16 benefit from unrealized gains on equity investments, partially offset by a $0.55 charge related to business reorganization and restructuring in international. Inventory at quarter end was relatively flat to last year. This includes a nearly 3% decrease from Walmart U.S. I'm pleased with how our teams responded to the challenge early in the year to aggressively rebalance inventory for the current environment, and it sets us up in a really good position going into the year.Let me briefly reference key highlights for Q4 by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales were strong throughout the quarter, and December was the largest sales month in Walmart U.S. history. This was led by strength in food sales, which increased high teens partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in general merchandise sales with softness in toys, electronics, home and apparel. The effects of product mix shifts have negatively impacted our margins. Over the last year, grocery and health and wellness sales, which have a lower margin than general merchandise, have increased by 330 basis points as a portion of our mix. We continue to see strong share gains in grocery with nearly half coming from higher income households and private brand penetration increased over 160 basis points as customers prioritize value.Inflation remained high, up mid-teens in food categories, which was similar to Q3 levels. E-commerce sales were led by continued strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in Q4. Over the last two years, store fulfilled delivery sales have nearly tripled, and we're now doing over $1 billion a month, which gives you an indication of why we're so excited about the progress here. Advertising sales were also strong this quarter, up 41%. Higher sales and lower COVID costs contributed to SG&amp;A expense leverage, which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in operating income growth of 3.8%. In international, strong sales trends continued with growth of 5.5% on a constant currency basis led by double-digit growth in Walmex in China. Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $900 million or an approximate 340 basis point headwind to growth.Q4 sales benefited from successful festive events across our markets. Year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by the timing shift of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event to Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. Looking at the second half of the year in total, International sales grew more than 9% in constant currency. E-commerce sales were strong with penetration at 21%, with China leading the way at 48% penetration for the quarter. Walmex had another great quarter with sales strength in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 14% growth in e-commerce. Segment adjusted operating income grew faster than sales, up nearly 17% in constant currency, helped by effective cost management across markets. In India, Flipkart continued its strong momentum through Diwali and other seasonal events.We are particularly pleased to see Flipkart's positive contribution margin expanding. PhonePe's recent valuation that Doug talked about was supported by annualized TPV, reaching more than $950 billion, about 50% higher than just one year ago, while also exceeding more than 4 billion monthly transactions. Turning to Sam's Club. Our strong momentum continued, with comps up 12.6% in Q4 and up 23.4% on a two-year stack. The segment delivered another quarter of record member counts and membership income growth was above 7%. In addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam's e-commerce sales were up 21% year-over-year with contributions from both curbside and ship to home. Operating income was pressured in the quarter by elevated markdowns lapping higher co-branded credit card income last year and an inflation-related LIFO charge of $14 million.With the strong trends at Sam's over the past several years, we're excited to expand our physical footprint through a multiyear investment in new clubs and supply chain optimization. Turning to guidance. As we sit here today, we find ourselves in a similar position to each of the last three years, where there is a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of the year. While the supply chain issues have largely abated prices are still high and there is considerable pressure on the consumer, attempting to predict with precision these swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer behavior is challenging. As such, our guidance reflects a cautious outlook on the macro environment, but at the same time, our excitement about our recent results, momentum in all segments and progress on our strategy both for this year and the years that follow.We are positioned well and convicted about our plan. In FY '24, we expect operating income growth to outpace sales growth. Given the persistence of high prices and the potential for further macro pressures, we are taking a cautious outlook for the year. We are guiding enterprise sales growth of 2.5% to 3% in constant currency and operating income growth of approximately 3%. This guidance assumes product mix pressures persist, but that our business mix continues to improve. Even with an estimated 100 basis point impact from LIFO charges, we still expect to grow operating income more than sales. We also expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, and international sales growth in constant currency of approximately 6% and Sam's Club comp sales growth of approximately 5%, excluding fuel.Based on FX rates at the end of our fiscal year, we estimate a potential year-over-year enterprise sales tailwind of about $1.2 billion from currency. Our purpose starts by helping people save money and live better, and it's more important than ever in this environment as consumers manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biosim spending toward everyday essentials. We're reinforcing our value proposition across our merchandise offering, including featuring high-quality owned brands and leaning into opening price points. We're accelerating share gains in our food categories and seeing signs of improved attach rates in consumables and high-frequency purchase areas of general merchandise. Our multiyear sales and operating income targets are just that, multiyear.In some years, our performance will be higher and in some years lower. We are confident, however, that we're building a business that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout an economic cycle. Over the past five years, sales have grown approximately 6% on average, excluding divestitures. This year will likely be lower, but we look forward to getting back to a sales growth trend more in line with what we've delivered over the last few years. Over that same period, operating income has grown at about half the rate of sales growth on an adjusted basis, excluding divestitures. This is the result of important investments we made in associate wages pricing, technology and supply chain, which together strengthened our core business and position us well for the future.Importantly, while we navigate some of the short-term challenges, we're continuing to invest for the future, invest in ways that strengthen our retail advantages by expanding our capabilities in marketplace, ad platform, data ventures and fulfillment as a service. We're providing more convenience for customers, including pickup and delivery, scan &amp; go and Walmart+. We're working in partnership with our suppliers and sellers to use data, scaled fulfillment capabilities and our rapidly growing ad platform to elevate inventory accuracy and in-stocks, lower the cost to serve and drive improved conversion. All of this improves the trajectory of our ROI and our margin profile. We will continue to invest in our associates through increased pay and benefits to reinforce the latter of opportunities at Walmart, but we're managing our cost in a way that allows us to achieve our operating income goals with these investments.In other words, we're staying true to our commitment of everyday low cost, enabling everyday low prices. We expect FY '24 CapEx to be flat to up slightly in total dollars compared to last year as we continue the multiyear investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain in stores. Many of these tech enhancements are reaching a stage where we can rapidly deploy them across our network, and we have clear line of sight toward better efficiencies and ROI on these investments in the medium term. I want to call out a few other assumptions for our guidance for the year. Gross margin rate is expected to increase this year, though not back to FY '22 levels yet. We expect gross margin to benefit from the lapping of higher supply chain costs and markdowns from this past year as well as growth from our newer initiatives, many of which have a higher profit margin.Partially offsetting this, we expect product mix and inflation-related LIFO charges to be gross margin headwinds. Based on current assumptions for inflation, LIFO charges for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $500 million this year with a headwind equally proportioned across quarters. This is an improvement from the $1 billion LIFO estimate we provided on the Q3 call due to moderating inflation in key merchandise categories and reduced inventory levels. It's important to note that inflation inventory levels and additional factors will influence the aggregate amount. We'll commit to providing updates as we go through the year with sales growth expected at a lower rate versus the prior year and our commitment to continuing to invest in our people and technology, we expect SG&amp;A to de-lever slightly in FY '24.There are also several below-the-line items that will pressure EPS for FY '24. First, interest expense is estimated to be about $750 million higher than last year. This translates to an approximate $0.20 year-over-year EPS headwind with Q1's impact less than the remaining quarters. Second, we do not expect a repeat of the benefit we realized from certain discrete tax items last year. And as such, expect our tax rate to be more normalized in FY '24 at 25.5% to 26.5%, resulting in an approximate $0.10 EPS headwind. And lastly, in our non-controlling interest line, we expect an approximate $0.12 EPS headwind related to acquiring full ownership of Massmart and Alert Innovation as well as the impacts to minority interest of strong expected performance at Walmex.In total, these below-the-line factors account for approximately $0.42 of year-over-year EPS headwind. The impact from these below-the-line items offsets the gains we're making in our core business, resulting in EPS being slightly down for the year. We expect full year EPS of between $5.90 and $6.05, including a $0.14 headwind from LIFO. For the first quarter, we expect to see a higher rate of sales growth of 4.5% to 5%, largely due to inflation. We expect operating income to increase 3.5% to 4%, including the negative impact of a LIFO charge of approximately 235 basis points. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.25 to $1.30, including an approximate $0.03 headwind from LIFO. While we're not providing quarterly guidance beyond Q1, I want to offer the following perspective.We currently expect sales growth to be strongest in the first half then moderating in the second half, reflecting our macro assumptions and a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Because we will lap the benefit we received last year from insurance proceeds in 2Q, we expect operating income to be flat in 2Q relative to last year. We expect operating income growth to begin to outpace sales growth to a greater degree in the second half of the year versus the first half. In closing, I want to echo Doug's Sentiment on our business. Over the last year, our team responded to some of the external challenges with the speed and nimbleness rarely seen in a company of our size and we exited the year in a much, much better place. As I reflect on where we are today, I'm more excited about our future than at any point in my time here.The opportunity in front of us is incredible. Our customer member value proposition has never been stronger. Perhaps that's more obvious during times like this when the consumer is pressured. We have become an omni-channel retailer. Who else has the stores and clubs so close to so many customers and members, combined with first- and third-party e-commerce and the combination of grocery and general merchandise and in multiple attractive countries. We're in the right markets with a breadth of assortment and ways of shopping like no one else with impactful and emerging digital and technological capabilities. Our plan leverages our strengths to serve our customers and members in more ways. We meet them where they are, to continue to help them save money and time, to help them live better.But what you're going to see in the years to come is that we will keep changing, and the changes will improve the composition of our P&amp;L. We will have related diversified higher-margin earning streams that are scaling rapidly. You will begin to see the significant benefits from the investments that we're making in things like our supply chain automation and our expanded e-commerce capabilities. We're at an inflection point to begin to accelerate margin expansion, reinforcing that the algorithm is in place. The macro pressures this year may obscure some of that progress, but won't take away from the long-term promise of many of these initiatives.

Full-year 2022 revenue saw a decrease of 9.8% to $418.9 million. However, CEO Ethan Brown said the brand is ""making solid progress"" in its ""transition to a sustainable growth model, one that emphasizes the achievement of cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023.""Here's what Beyond Meat reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, per Bloomberg consensus estimates:Revenue: $79.9 million versus $75.7 million expectedAdjusted earnings per share: -$1.05 versus -$1.18 expectedBeyond Meat is focused on its three primary pillars, Brown said, including driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction, bringing inventory levels down while generating cash flow, and placing a ""greater emphasis on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while also supporting strategic key long-term partners and opportunities.”At the end of October, Beyond Meat announced plans to reduce expenses and target cash flow operations within the second half of 2023, which coincided with the announcement of a 19% cut in its workforce.In the release, Brown said the fourth-quarter results ""clearly demonstrate delivery"" of the plan it set out last fall, ""including solid sequential progress on margin recovery and operating expense reduction, and continued inventory drawdown.""Standouts of the fourth quarter, per the release, include industry notoriety received from innovations like Beyond Steak, in addition to the launch of plant-based McPlant Nuggets in Germany earlier this week. That offering is part of it three-year partnership with McDonald's (MCD), which is now days away from its two-year anniversary. Back in September of 2021, McDonald's announced its plan to test its first-ever plant-based burger, the McPlant.Story continuesIn the release, there was no mention of the status of its partnership with KFC (YUM), Beyond Chicken.As far as retailers, right now, Beyond Meat is offered at Kroger (KR), Walmart (WMT), Publix Super Markets, Costco (COST), Whole Foods (AMZN) and Target (TGT).SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 14: In this photo illustration, a McDonald's McPlant Beyond Meat burger is displayed with french fries at a McDonald's restaurant on February 14, 2022 in San Rafael, California. Nearly three years after Burger King and Carl's Jr. rolled out meat-free burgers, McDonald's has debuted its McPlant burger made with a Beyond Meat vegetarian patty. For a limited time the burger is being offered at 600 McDonald's restaurants across the country. (Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)For the full year 2023 outlook, the company expects net revenue to be between a range of $375 million to $415 million, a decrease of 10% to 1% compared to 2022. Gross margin is expected to be in the low-double digit range. It expects to incur $250 million in operating expenses, ""weighted slightly more towards the first half of the year.""The company did note ""unforeseen impacts"" that could impact the company's results including ""near-term uncertainty related to macroeconomic issues,"" such as inflation and rising interest rates, ""demand in the plant-based meat category, increasing concerns about the likelihood of a recession, increased competition, supply chain disruptions, challenges related to labor availability and, to a lesser extent, COVID-19 and its potential impact on consumer behavior and demand levels, among other things.""This comes as demand for plant-based meat overall is lower, as customers trade-down for cheaper protein options amid inflation.Brown said he remains focused becoming cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023 and on the long-term outlook for the brand as it ""navigate(s) current conditions.""He said, ""We remain intently focused on positioning Beyond Meat to capture the vast opportunity to be a major protein provider in the $1.4 trillion meat industry.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We saw a slew of companies reporting fourth quarter earnings this week. It was Lucid. It was Etsy, eBay. And those were just to name a few.But what grade do they get for their quarterly report card? Well, I'm going to focus in on a few of them that caught my attention. I'm going to start things off with Walmart, the retailer you go to, you know. And at the end of the day, yeah, I gave them a B-minus, and here's why.They talked about some caution on the consumer. And if the biggest retailer, brick and mortar fashion-style, is saying this and also citing some weakness in home, electronics, and apparel and some of those discretionary categories, that should actually send a little bit of shock throughout the rest of the retail landscape as well.Now, Walmart here on the day, it's down by about 1.4%. One of the other keys to remember with Walmart, even with their caution on the consumer, they're saying on the earnings call, have said on the earnings call, it's attempting to predict with precision three swings-- or these swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer behavior but calling it very challenging right now. So net-net, gave it a B-minus.And want to get back to this report card here. Let's go to the C. Now, this was Home Depot. They got a C grade here, and here's why. When you think about what exactly is going to continue to challenge them in this near term, this is a company that definitely touches, of course, that DIY home care or home project market as well as some of those core customers that are constructing in a large order capacity.They had a revenue miss. They issued weak guidance. Shares here on the day, they are higher by about 7/10 of a percent. But they did give that warning to investors.Story continuesHowever, one of the bright spots that I'll shout out, this is a company that in their process of taking care of businesses, trying to take care of their employees a little bit better here too. They did ultimately raise that minimum wage for those employees. And so we will continue to see exactly what type of effect that has in the broader labor and employment situation environment, as the competition for labor continues.And we've got to talk about Nividia. We were just mentioning how well they did in at least the earnings call. But the quarter wasn't all roses, everyone. You've got to remember, there were actually two categories that they did not perform that well in and saw year over year declines that were quite significant. And that was actually being run through by our own Dan Howley.But within that gaming segment as well as the professional visualization segment, severe declines year over year. However, given that the future is AI, the company did so good at selling what this could actually look like and some of the consortium of contending partners, that they've been able to insulate themselves with around for this vision. Now all sights are going to be on their conference and what more detail they provide in the coming weeks here. Ultimately shares moving higher by about 14% here, Ines. So that was your earnings report card for this week.]"

18,1c8a0beb-fffd-3dd9-ad7e-c6f33c259cdf,JWN,2023-02-24,Earnings Preview: Nordstrom (JWN) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-nordstrom-jwn-q4-150003455.html,1677164403,STORY,"['JWN', 'ANF']","[The market expects Nordstrom (JWN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.2%.Revenues are expected to be $4.33 billion, down 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 117.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom?For Nordstrom, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nordstrom will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nordstrom would post earnings of $0.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of +42.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nordstrom doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAbercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.85 for the quarter ended January 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -25.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.18 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Abercrombie has been revised 86.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -5.10%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Abercrombie will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thus necessitating a discussion about stocks to sell. Keep in mind that this narrative doesn’t center on hating or bashing affected enterprises. Rather, investors just need to appreciate certain realities.It also doesn’t mean that you should dump all your holdings on the identified stocks to sell, particularly if you have good reason to believe in their viability. I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t get it right all the time. However, unfavorable economic factors relating to consumer sentiment make certain enterprises riskier than others. Plus, any good investor seeking long-term success will need to reevaluate their position from time to time. Perhaps now would be a time to consider challenged stocks to sell.JWNNordstrom$21.79DDSDillard’s$406.65SWGAYSwatch Group$17.89RHRH.$315.88VRMVroom$1.10SBUXStarbucks$107.10RUTHRuth’s Hospitality$17.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Sell: Nordstrom (JWN)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockOn paper, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) doesn’t immediately strike investors as one of the stocks to sell. For instance, investment resource Gurufocus.com labels shares modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the market prices JWN at a forward multiple of 11.89. As a discount to earnings, Nordstrom ranks better than 67.31% of the industry.So, what gives? Fundamentally, if consumer sentiment continues to stay deflated against historical norms, Nordstrom may be in trouble. Let’s face it – people don’t necessarily need the products the luxury department store sells. Rather, they want it. However, people also want to put food on the table and they definitely need that. Therefore, JWN could be one of the stocks to sell if consumers limit their spending. Also, Wall Street analysts don’t have a great view of JWN, pegging it a consensus hold. In addition, their average price target sits at $18.14, implying nearly 17% downside.Story continuesStocks to Sell: Dillard’s (DDS)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockAs with rival Nordstrom, Dillard’s (NYSE:DDS) might not immediately seem like one of the stocks to sell. For one thing, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 8 times. As a discount to earnings, Dillard’s ranks better than 82% of its peers. Also, the company features a rock-solid balance sheet. Combined with operational strengths (robust revenue growth, outstanding profit margins), DDS could swing higher.At the same time, Dillard’s faces the same fundamental challenge as Nordstrom: people don’t necessarily need the products Dillard’s offers. To be fair, DDS represents a stunner of a chart performer, gaining 28% since the January opener. In the trailing year, it’s up 67%. However, if headwinds such as mass layoffs impact consumer sentiment, DDS could come down in a hurry.Also, JPMorgan Chase’s Matthew Boss isn’t a fan of DDS, rating it a “hold” recently. Also, the analyst targets shares dropping to $345, implying greater than 15% downside risk. To be sure, positive hedge fund sentiment for DDS contradicts Boss’ pessimism. Again, though, it’s all about what the consumer will bear.Stocks to Sell: Swatch (SWGAY)earningsSource: ShutterstockA Swiss manufacturer of watches and jewelry, Swatch (OTCMKTS:SWGAY) commands significant marquee value in the global consumer discretionary space. While the company carries the modest brand name of low-cost watches, it also commands an enviable portfolio. Global brands like Tissot, Longines, Blancpain, and Omega – and many, many others – sit beneath the Swatch umbrella.Not too long ago, the parent company made the decision to manufacture the Moonswatch collection, combining the Omega Speedmaster model name with Swatch’s modest quality and pricing. In other words, customers can get a “Speedy” for hundreds of dollars instead of thousands of dollars. While I can’t speak for all horologists, I think this represents a distasteful example of brand dilution. You’re never going to see Rolex manufacture a cheap Daytona or Submariner for the masses. No, you want a Rolex, you better earn a Rolex. Unfortunately, Swatch’s misguided decision may impugn the Omega brand.Also, note that Swatch only beat its earnings per share and revenue estimates half of the time during the past 12 months. If consumer sentiment takes a hit, SWGAY may be one of the stocks to sell.RH (RH)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockA manufacturer of upscale home furnishings, RH (NYSE:RH) represents a premium player in the consumer discretionary space. As with the top two names, RH doesn’t immediately strike investors as one of the stocks to sell. For example, the market prices RH at a trailing multiple of 12.05. As a discount to earnings, RH ranks better than 62.2% of its peers. Also, the company enjoys operational strengths relative to its industry.Admittedly, then, a danger exists in considering RH as one of the stocks to sell. That’s especially true if you’re looking to short (I probably wouldn’t do that though). However, the Fed’s monetary tightening campaign spiked benchmark interest rates. In turn, this hurt housing market sentiment due to additional affordability constraints associated with higher borrowing costs. By logical deduction, consumers may not be gung-ho about furniture, especially premium furniture.To be fair, RH carries a consensus view of moderate buy. However, it’s a very split opinion: eight buys, eight holds, and one sell. If the Fed continues to hike rates – something that might happen due to a strong overall labor market – then RH may face headwinds.Vroom (VRM)stocks to sell a group of businessmen holding their thumbs down. worst investments of 2020Source: ShutterstockFundamentally, I shouldn’t receive too much flak for identifying Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM) as possibly one of the stocks to sell. As a used-car retailer specializing in online car deliveries, it basically competes with Carvana (NYSE:CVNA). Of course, the problem with that is simply Carvana’s business looks like a word I can’t say here. On a year-to-date basis, VRM hemorrhaged nearly 83% of equity value. On the flip side, CVNA fell a staggering 91% exactly. Frankly, we’re not dealing with a full deck here.Nevertheless, I don’t consider every name in the automotive sector as stocks to sell. Far from it; I mentioned many times that the average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways hit a record 12.2 years. Therefore, people will need to replace their cars eventually. So, car demand isn’t the issue. Rather, the challenge for Vroom is that it imposes a service premium that simply doesn’t exist for brick-and-mortar used-car dealerships. Therefore, VRM just screams stocks to sell.Starbucks (SBUX)a businessman with his thumb facing downSource: ShutterstockAs with many other stocks to sell on this list, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) doesn’t immediately strike investors as a particularly bearish entity. Sure, SBUX trades at a forward multiple of 31.62, which rates as overvalued relative to the industry. However, it features a three-year revenue growth rate of 9% and a net margin of 10%. Both stats ping in the upper echelon of the underlying sector.So, why even bother listing SBUX as one of the stocks to sell? Early last year, Starbucks hiked prices, naturally blaming inflation. To be sure, it didn’t negatively impact sentiment as the prior operational stats suggest. If anything, people continued to pile into its stores.I’ve got to be honest, Starbucks carries such high customer loyalty that this could go either way. However, if we’re talking about consumers tightening their belts, then Starbucks faces risks. After all, with the combination of elevated inflation and rising layoffs, something’s got to give.Ruth’s Hospitality (RUTH)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockOn the last name for this list of stocks to sell, we have Ruth’s Hospitality (NASDAQ:RUTH). Again, on paper, Ruth’s doesn’t appear a candidate for a bearish take. First off, the market prices RUTH at a trailing multiple of 15. As a discount to earnings, Ruth’s ranks better than over 78% of the competition. As well, it features a net margin of 8.1%, outpacing 81.58% of its rivals.Nevertheless, if we’re talking about rising consumer pressures, then Ruth’s presents serious concerns. Namely, the company stands at the top of the trade-down effect. As a premium operator of fine-dining establishments (Ruth’s Chris Steak House), it’s easy to trade down to a cheaper alternative. For instance, you might opt for a more reasonable experience at Red Lobster. Now, Ruth has been a strong performer in terms of growth, I’ve got to be clear about that. However, if consumer pressures continue to build, it’s going to be extremely difficult to justify Ruth’s. Therefore, it’s a name to be extremely careful about.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Shares have added about 3.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UMB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.UMB Financial Q4 Earnings Top, Revenues Rise Y/YUMB Financial reported fourth-quarter 2022 net operating income (GAAP basis) of $2.06 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04. The bottom line also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.61.Results were aided by higher revenues, expansion of NIM and increasing loan balances. However, a rise in expenses and provisions adversely impacted the company’s performance.UMB Financial reported GAAP net income of $100.2 million in the fourth quarter, up from $78.5 million recorded a year ago.Revenues &amp; Costs Rise, Average Loans and Deposits GrowTotal revenues for the fourth quarter were $370.7 million, up 12.5% year over year. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $375.3 million.Revenues for 2022 came in at $1.47 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 billion. However, the top line increased 15.2%.NII on a quarterly basis was $245.2 million, reflecting an increase of 16.4%. Growth in average loans and higher interest rates mainly led to this upside. The NIM expanded to 2.83% from the prior-year quarter’s 2.37%.Non-interest income was $125.5 million, up 5.7%, mainly due to higher brokerage income, bankcard income and the company-owned life insurance income, partially offset by lower investment and securities gain, service charges on deposits and derivative income.Non-interest expenses were $237.8 million, up 6.9%. Increased salaries and employee benefits expenses, processing fees, marketing and business development expenses, bankcard expenses and occupancy expenses primarily resulted in this upside.The efficiency ratio decreased to 63.72% from the prior-year quarter’s 67.78%. A decline in the efficiency ratio indicates increase in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2022, average loans and leases were $20.3 billion, up 5.2% from the sequential quarter’s level.Story continuesAverage deposits grew 5.3% to $31.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.Credit Quality – A Mixed BagThe ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.04% in the reported quarter, down 15 basis points from the year-ago quarter’s level.

25,d7a23586-cc8e-354a-bba0-cef9ca4270d7,NCLH,2023-02-24,Xponential Fitness (XPOF) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xponential-fitness-xpof-reports-next-150003587.html,1677164403,STORY,"['XPOF', 'NCLH']","[The market expects Xponential Fitness (XPOF) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis franchisor of boutique fitness brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +114.3%.Revenues are expected to be $67.22 million, up 36.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 16.48% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xponential Fitness?For Xponential Fitness, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -181.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xponential Fitness will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xponential Fitness would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.10, delivering a surprise of -16.67%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xponential Fitness doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerNorwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), another stock in the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.89 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +54.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.5 billion, up 207.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Norwegian Cruise Line has been revised 18.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.93%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Norwegian Cruise Line will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Callon Petroleum Callon Petroleum's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Callon Petroleum has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, Callon Petroleum's EPS shot from US$7.51 to US$19.63, over the last year. Year on year growth of 161% is certainly a sight to behold. Shareholders will be hopeful that this is a sign of the company reaching an inflection point.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Callon Petroleum shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 26% to 42%, and revenue is growing.

And thanks to Europe's mild winter, brimming storage and gas substitution, yearend natural gas prices are back to where they were 11 months ago - down more than 31% so far in 2023.But it's the pickup and stickiness in underlying ""core"" prices, excluding energy and food, that is irking the central banks and the Federal Reserve most of all.And if the world economy is gathering some steam again in 2023, as recent numbers suggest, interest rate policy may have to be a lot harsher than everyone has assumed.Alongside another tight U.S. weekly jobs report, markets got another glimpse of those price pressures on Thursday.The Commerce Department showed inflation increased much faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter of last year, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure that the Fed favours accelerating at a 4.3% pace compared with prior estimate of 3.9%.The revisions to prices were led by used and new motor vehicles and fees for nonprofit hospital services.Friday gets a more updated monthly view of core PCE from January and it's not yet clear if quarterly revisions affect the standing consensus forecast for an easing of the rate to 4.3% from 4.4% in December - still more than twice the Fed's target.Markets are now braced for three more quarter-point rate hikes from the Fed to at least 5.25%-5.50%, with no cut fully priced from there by yearend. At 4.71% on Friday, two-year Treasury yields are close to cycle highs.Story continuesAlthough cheered on Thursday by chip designer Nvidia's blowout earnings and upbeat outlook, S&amp;P500 stock futures are back in the red - barely clinging to the pivotal 4,000 point level.And increasingly buoyed by the still intense geopolitical fallout from a year of the war in Ukraine, the dollar pushed higher yet again.Whether China now backs Moscow militarily as well as rhetorically is seen as one of the biggest global questions surrounding the war 12 months on and would mark critical juncture in Western relations with Beijing too - and in trade globalisation more generally.China's offshore yuan fell to its lowest level of the year against the dollar on Friday.The dollar also rose against Japan's yen on Friday, with the Nikkei's 1% gain bucking the dour weekend mood elsewhere, after comments by the incoming Bank of Japan chief.Even though data showed Japan's core consumer inflation hitting a fresh 41-year high in January, Kazuo Ueda insisted the BOJ must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the fragile economy, warning of the dangers of responding to cost-driven inflation with monetary tightening.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. January personal income and spending, PCE inflation indices, January new home sales; Kansas City Fed February service sector survey * Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, Fed Board Governor Philip Jefferson, Boston Fed chief Susan Collins speak. Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro speaks * Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida chairs G7 leaders meeting.

Police are investigating the cause of the disaster and have detained several people suspected for being responsible, state broadcaster CCTV reported.The mine in question has a history of safety violations and was shut down for three years before 2021, when government officials gave the company permission to reopen it and convert it from a below-ground to an open-pit operation, consultancy Fengkuang Coal Logistics said in a research note.Xinjing Coal didn’t respond to a request for comment sent to its public email address.That year, China began a campaign to boost coal production after a shortage of the fuel caused widespread power outages. The efforts paid off, with production jumping 10% last year and China getting through the winter without supply disruptions and with ample stockpiles.But even at the time, industry executives warned that the push to produce more would likely cost lives as companies reopened and expanded smaller mines that, prior to the crisis, had been deemed unnecessary.Among the safety problems at the Xinjing mine, it faced administrative punishment for not having signs for speed limits and crossings on the main road to the pit, and for failing to have a warning sign in a landslide area, according to Fengkuang. It was forced to stop production in 2015 for not receiving approval to begin construction and for not implementing environmental impact assessment requirements, the consultancy said.Story continuesAs rescue crews continue their search for the remaining missing workers, government officials in Inner Mongolia and neighboring provinces have launched safety inspections to try to prevent more accidents. That may slow production in the first quarter, but the impact is likely to be limited as Beijing continues to prioritize producing enough coal to fuel its economic rebound, according to a note from Citic Futures Co.(Updates with attempt to reach company in 4th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAfter Multibillion-Dollar Fintech Binge, Wall Street Has a Writedown HangoverGerm-Zapping Lasers Help Cut Down on Infections After SurgeryHow Ben &amp; Jerry's Ended Up at War With ItselfWith Human Metalworkers Hard to Come By, Robotic Blacksmiths Step UpSpy Balloons Are the Slow and Silent Future of Surveillance©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures (WTI) settled at $76.32 a barrel, rising 93 cents, or 1.2%. Earlier, both fell by more than $1 a barrel.The benchmarks were little changed on the week.Lower trading volumes contributed to volatility, with Brent trading at 58% and WTI trading at 90% of the previous session's levels.On the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, benchmark Brent crude was about 15% lower than a year earlier. It hit a 14-year high of nearly $128 a barrel on Mar. 8, 2022.Both benchmarks rose about 2% in the previous session on Russia's plans to cut oil exports from its western ports by up to 25% in March, which exceeded its announced production cuts of 500,000 barrels per day.But the market appeared to be well supplied with U.S. inventories at their highest since May 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]An indicator of future supply, U.S. oil rigs fell seven to 600 this week, while the total count was still up 103 rigs, or 15.8%, over this time last year, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said.Indications that Russian crude and refined products are accumulating on tankers floating at sea also hinted at increasing supplies.JP Morgan said in a note that it thinks short-term prices are more likely to drift lower toward the $70s than rise ""as global growth headwinds strengthen and excess ‘dark’ inventory exacerbated by a flooding of Russian oil is worked off"".The bank also said it expects the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production to limit oil price declines.Minutes of the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting indicated that a majority of officials remained hawkish on inflation and tight labour market conditions, signalling further monetary tightening.Story continuesThe prospect of further interest rate hikes supported the dollar index, which was set for a fourth straight week of gains. The index is now up about 2.5% for the month. [FRX/]""While... curtailed Russian supply are certainly formidable bullish considerations, price action across the complex this month has sent off a powerful message that rising US interest rates that were further reinforced by Fed minutes, will be a major impediment to sustainable oil price strength,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of consultancy Ritterbusch and associates..A firm dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.(Additional reporting by Ron Bousso, Andrew Hayley and Jeslyn LerhEditing by Sharon Singleton, Kirsten Donovan, David Goodman and David Gregorio)]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.75 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.18 points to a change of +12.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.98 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.1%. The $56.21 billion and $58.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.84%. The EPS surprise was +4.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy For The Next 3 Months. Element Capital, one of the largest macro hedge funds in the world managed by Jeffrey Talpins, plans to reduce its asset base in order to boost its performance following a series of poor returns. The fund, which currently manages around $12 billion in assets and has a strong long-term track record, suffered a significant loss of 9.6% last month as equity markets surged on the expectation that interest rates would not rise further. In response, Element Capital will make it easier for investors to exit the fund by temporarily relaxing its redemption terms, a move aimed at reducing the firm's assets to increase its agility and ability to react quickly to market changes. In January, certain hedge funds encountered difficulties due to the rally in equities, particularly speculative stocks that were heavily impacted in the previous year. Additionally, bond markets also experienced gains due to the expectation that central banks were effectively controlling inflation. As a result, funds that were positioned for higher interest rates, including computer-driven funds that were betting on declines in bond and equity prices, suffered significant losses.On the other hand, there were clear winners in the stock market as well. Said Haidar, the founder of Haidar Capital Management, had a strong belief that inflation was going to rapidly increase globally, which is evident by the figure of $63 billion - the amount of assets that the hedge fund reported at the beginning of 2022. However, the hedge fund's actual assets were only $1.2 billion due to extensive leverage. This resulted in a tumultuous year with a significant increase of 54% in one month, and a decrease of 20% in another. Nevertheless, the hedge fund generated a return of 193% for its investors. Haidar made a substantial bet on the rapid rise of interest rates, leading the hedge fund to profit from the rise in inflation that led to the most combative central bank tightening campaign. Haidar personally earned $859 million in 2022, which ranks him sixth on Bloomberg's annual list of the top hedge fund managers. While the list is dominated by industry sharks, Haidar is a relatively unknown name. The top three spots were claimed by Ken Griffin, Steve Cohen, and Izzy Englander, who are collectively worth about $55 billion.Story continuesIt is wise to follow the movements of elite hedge funds to navigate the tumultuous stock market. Some of the best stocks to invest in according to smart investors include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top 10 companies that were most popular among smart investors. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Stocks To Buy For The Next 3 Months Pixabay/Public DomainBest Stocks To Buy For The Next 3 Months 10. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based company that uses customer relationship management technology to bring companies and customers together worldwide. According to Morgan Stanley, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has the potential to increase its earnings per share by 20% or more in the coming years. This is due to the company's recent restructuring and involvement of activist investors, which could improve its financial performance.On February 21, Cowen raised the firm's price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $170 from $160 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The reason behind this move was that Cowen’s survey of commercial partners indicated a strong performance in the fourth quarter. However, their checks on enterprises showed weaker results, which suggests that there may be higher pressure on net expansion rates and cross-selling. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is facing different factors such as activism, an increased focus on profit, and challenging demand headwinds. Despite these challenges, the stock is responding well to the outlook of stronger margins after the company's headcount cuts.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 117 hedge funds were long Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Harris Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.14 million shares worth $1.08 million. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best stocks to invest in. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”9. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 129Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) is a California-based developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. On February 21, it was announced that the 13-month-old proposal by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $69 billion could be entering a crucial phase in Europe. This comes after a closed-door hearing with European Union regulators to determine whether the proposed acquisition raises significant anti-competitive concerns. On February 16, Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Soff upgraded Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $90, up from $83. The analyst believes that the company's business model provides the best risk/reward outlook across the gaming sector this year. He stated that Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) has strong momentum across its major franchises, with the highest concentration of ""must-have"" content at a time when consumers are becoming increasingly selective. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) also has the potential to offer attractive returns for shareholders, even if the proposed Microsoft deal falls through. Despite challenges in consumer spending across the industry, the analyst believes that Activision can still generate healthy growth levels this year.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 129 hedge funds were bullish on Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), up from 96 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 52.7 million shares worth $4.03 billion. Here is what Cooper Investors specifically said about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) – our investment preceded news that the company was under investigation for workplace bullying. When it became clear management had misled the market on the extent of the problem we sold, led by our principles of Responsible Investing. We did not benefit from the subsequent M&amp;A premium paid by Microsoft.”8. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the biggest mobility technology companies in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia excluding China and Southeast Asia. It operates through three segments – Mobility, Delivery, and Freight. On February 20, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced that it is planning to introduce 25,000 electric vehicles for ride-sharing in India over the course of three years as part of its effort to become more environmentally friendly. To achieve this goal, the ride-hailing platform's fleet partners will purchase 25,000 XPRES'T electric vehicle units from Tata Motors. The EVs will operate in several major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Ahmedabad.On February 13, Argus analyst Bill Selesky raised the firm's price target on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) to $43 from $36 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst believes that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s ridesharing and food delivery businesses will perform strongly in the future, and the company will return to pre-pandemic ridership levels by 2023. The research note also mentions that Argus is optimistic about Uber's recent acquisitions of Drizly, which is an on-demand alcohol marketplace that will expand the company's Delivery business, and Transplace, a logistics technology platform with one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks in the world.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 database, 135 hedge funds were long Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and it is one of the best stocks to buy according to smart investors. Alkeon Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 12.80 million shares worth $316.7 million. Artisan Partners made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we began new GardenSM campaigns in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Shopify. In July, we initiated our position in Uber, a leader in global ride-hailing and online food delivery. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from strong secular tailwinds in both of its core businesses. Earlier this year, management outlined a plan at its investor day to achieve $4 billion of free cash flow by 2024, an encouraging commitment given investors have maligned the company for years of being unprofitable. We witnessed solid progress toward achieving this goal in the company’s most recent earnings results, where it beat expectations for the quarter on both fronts and delivered positive FCF for the first time. The company also indicated it isn’t seeing any evidence of slowing demand. We recognize the execution risk associated with Uber achieving its long-term targets, and the path likely won’t be linear, which is why we are keeping our position size modest until we see signs of continued operational momentum in the coming quarters.”7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported fourth quarter earnings on February 2. The company announced GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 and a revenue of $117.15 billion, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $4.5 billion, respectively. Installed base crossed 2 billion active devices and hit an all-time high for all major product categories. Apple’s board of directors also declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share, which was paid to unitholders on February 16, 2023. According to investment advisory Bernstein, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Services growth has decelerated for six consecutive quarters, with gross margins also contracting last quarter, primarily due to softness in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Advertising and App Store businesses. The firm predicts that Services will grow 10% in fiscal 2023 as reported, and 13% at constant currency, primarily due to weaker advertising growth. However, Bernstein believes that the weakness in Advertising and the App Store is a temporary downturn and not a fundamental one. In the long term, Bernstein expects Services to grow between 12% and 15% over the next 3 to 5 years, driven by growth in the installed base, increased ARPU, and new services offerings. Bernstein has a Market Perform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $125 as of February 21. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of 135 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 140 in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a  significant position holder in the company, with nearly 15 million shares worth $1.94 billion. Here is what Distillate Capital has to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The largest new purchase was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which after underperforming saw its valuation improve significantly. Over the course of the last year, Apple’s consensus estimated forward free cash flows rose modestly, while its enterprise value fell by around 30%. Apple ranks below the 25th most attractive name in the portfolio and so its weight is capped at 4% vs. 6% for names in the top quartile.”6. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American multinational payments technology firm. On January 26, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $2.65 and a revenue of $5.8 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.07 and $10 million, respectively.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the most popular stocks among smart investors. Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global payment network Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) increased after reporting strong quarterly results, with 15% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth despite significant headwinds from currency movements and the suspension of operations in Russia. Payment volume grew 21% in local currency (excluding Russia) as consumer spending remained resilient and the international travel recovery continued as border restrictions were lifted. We continue to own the stock due to Mastercard’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy For The Next 3 Months.  Suggested articles:12 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy11 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Buy For The Next 3 Months is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Arnold. Please go ahead.Jonathan P. ArnoldGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&amp;E's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's fourth quarter and full year earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. And the slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was released earlier this morning. And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.Story continuesPatricia Kessler PoppeThank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what I know is a busy earnings morning. As you'll see on Slide 3, this morning, we reported full year 2022 core earnings of $1.10 per share, right on guidance. This was my second year with PG&amp;E with results delivered on plan. No more, no less. As I like to say, we sweat the details so you don't have to. Our simple, affordable model is designed to maximize work for our customers and deliver on our commitment to you, our investors, each and every year. Our $1.10 EPS for 2022 was up 10% from 2021 as planned. We're also reaffirming our 2023 core EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, up 10% at the midpoint, along with our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for '25 and '26. Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity through 2024. As you know, our sector-leading EPS growth is supported by robust capital investment and ongoing efficiency gains for the benefit of the 16 million Californians we serve. In fact, in 2022, we invested $9.6 billion of capital into our system for the benefit of our customers. Our system has never been safer, and we continue to make it safer every day. I want to thank you, our investors, for your part in making that possible. The simple, affordable model underpins our confidence in reiterating our financial outlook today despite the very real challenges faced by most businesses in today's inflationary and uncertain economic environment. Turning to Slide 4. We've made strong progress mitigating physical and financial risk. So here are some high points. On wildfire mitigation, we saw a 99% reduction in acres burned in 2022 relative to the average of the 3 years directly before implementation of Enhanced Powerline Safety Setting. As we reported last quarter, we were able to successfully navigate extreme summer heat conditions. And in January, our system was put to the test again with an unprecedented series of winter storms, which were met with truly historic levels of performance from the PG&amp;E team. In addition to addressing physical risks, 2022 was a big year for our financial risk mitigation. We delivered our earnings guidance as well as non-fuel O&amp;M cost reductions of 3% net of inflation. This was ahead of our 2% plan and was achieved in the face of the most challenging inflationary backdrop many of us have seen in our careers. In our GRC, we added undergrounding while removing vegetation management expense, delivering long-term safety while keeping cost neutral for customers. We closed our $7.5 billion rate-neutral securitization and worked with California policymakers over the summer as they passed constructive legislation supporting our 10-year undergrounding plans and to extend the life of our Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. We view both as beneficial to customers and evidence of the greater trust we are building day in and day out with our stakeholders. On the regulatory front, we appreciate the CPUC resolving both the 2022 and 2023 cost of capital proceedings last year. And in terms of customer savings, the Net Energy Metering 3.0 decision was a win for customers. We estimate it removes about $1 billion of cost shift through 2030 relative to NEM 2.0. On Slide 5, we show some highlights on our historic January storm response. I want to emphasize that this story is about more than numbers on a page. This was us delivering for our hometowns, and our coworkers are at their best when put to the test. During the first 2 weeks of 2023, hit by historic back-to-back to back-to-back atmospheric river storms, our electric team restored over 2.8 million customers through multiple waves of outages, and we had 95% back online within 24 hours during each of those events. January ranked as the top 5 storm in PG&amp;E history and involved the largest contingent of resources we have ever mobilized, including around 7,200 dedicated personnel from 10 states. The strength and speed of our response also resulted in us seeing improved customer satisfaction scores compared to prior storm-related outages. We've also adopted the standardized emergency management system and Internet command system. And with the support from California's Office of Emergency Services, we've been aligning training of our emergency center staff with our first responder public safety partners. When the time came, our team and an army of partners acted with skill and tenacity, protecting and serving each other and our hometown, and we couldn't be prouder of them. On Slide 6, I'll recap our layers of protection against wildfire risk, which start with our core system hardening, vegetation management, inspections and repairs. When conditions warned, we supplement these with our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and our Public Safety Power Shutoffs. We calculate these layers of protection, including improved situational awareness and coordination with first responders, as delivering over 90% overall wildfire risk reduction. We've already hardened more than 1,200 miles since 2019, and we expect our overall risk reduction to further increase as we pursue our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. In the meantime, we continue to look for innovative new technology solutions such as partial voltage detection and down conductor technology to keep reducing that remaining 10%. On Slide 7, we take a closer look at our 2022 wildfire risk mitigation performance. Historical data show that from 2012 to 2020, that's before we implemented EPSS, 95% of the acres and 100% of the structures burned were related to ignitions at times when conditions were at R3 or higher. While we were fortunate that 2022 didn't bring significant wind events for the year, there were still 31% more R3 or higher days than in 2018 to 2020. Despite this significant increase, we saw a reduction of 99% in the number of acres impacted by utility ignitions in 2022 over the same time period. Slide 8 illustrates our simple, affordable model, which includes driving efficiency to make room for customer investment. You've heard us talk a lot about the lean operating system and our 4 basic plays. In 2023, we're rolling out a fifth play, my personal favorite, waste elimination. And we see this as key to continuing to deliver our plans for both customers and investors. Our primary constraint is customer affordability, on which we are laser-focused through our newly established bill ownership center led by Carla Peterman. The entire team is looking at the whole customer bill for savings, including energy supply costs, which we know are top of mind. We have a lot of opportunity to eliminate waste, improve our customers' experience, make our system cleaner and more resilient all the while reducing cost. We can do more for less. The examples keep piling up. So I felt I needed to bring back my story of the month. So here we go. This month's story is about work we are doing to improve efficiency in our new business area. Presently, our new customer connections take too long from start to finish. As I recently told a group of California builders, we can, and we will do better. In fact, it's another perfect application for our lean operating system, and specifically, waste elimination. The team invited our developers and builders to come in and work with us to redesign our processes and share their pain points. We conducted a design thinking workshop. And through rapid prototyping, we can see the path to taking the cycle time down dramatically, improving our ability to both do the hook up on time and in less time. Imagine the rework, the waste, the frustration, the delays we can eliminate. One challenge is that 64% of the new connection requests we receive today end up being canceled for a variety of reasons. We do too much engineering before we are sure it will even be used. This wastes both time and money, and it also is demoralizing for our talented engineers when much of their work never sees the light of day. We can dramatically improve how we show up for our new customers. And by doing that, we can free up more time and resources to reinvest back into the system. This is just one of the areas where we are delivering more for customers with every dollar spent. Now that's what I call enabling California's prosperity. Turning to Slide 9. You may recognize this chart, which shows how we executed in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, we faced headwinds early in the year. Our recovery work then put us ahead of plan. This is all part of the playbook we're running now at PG&amp;E. We plan conservatively, and we remain nimble, protecting investors from the downside. And when there's upside, we will redeploy it for the benefit of customers, which, in many cases, means pulling work forward and protecting future years. Consistency is the name of the game. You can see it play out again in 2022. We faced headwinds, including a possible cost of capital reset. We have planned conservatively, though, and we're able to more than offset this and other pressures, allowing us to redeploy again on behalf of our customers and still deliver 10% EPS growth. Employing the simple, affordable model, we plan to consistently manage the work and deliver our earnings targets, no more and no less. And when we can, we will redeploy favorability in the business on behalf of customers and look to derisk future years with a view to delivering our consistent growth trajectory. Lots of people say to me, ""Patti, what if this happens or what if that happens?"" This is what we manage at PG&amp;E. Come what may, we have the capability to be nimble and adapt to those challenging and changing conditions. It's a capability that can be taught and learned. As I've said many times, we ride the roller coaster so you don't have to. You can expect to see more of this in 2023 and beyond. Moving to Slide 10. You can see the progress we made in 2022 as we continue on our journey to build trust with policymakers while creating the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of customers. Already, in 2023, we're pleased with the expedited resolution of our self-insurance settlement reached as part of our General Rate Case. This innovative approach enjoys intervenous support and most importantly, can result in up to $1.8 billion of savings for customers over the 4-year GRC period with as much as $300 million expected in 2023. We also have a number of important catalysts on the horizon. Each of the 4 items you'll see here in blue contain important benefits for our customers and for California. We'll continue to work every day toward timely and constructive outcomes, but we don't do big bets here at PG&amp;E. And I want to remind you that we continue to plan conservatively even as I look forward to seeing more green check marks on this slide. Turning to Slide 11. Let's take a look at our 2022 report card. While the material fire did not result in any serious injuries and the estimated liability is well within our available insurance, it did cause us to miss our goal of 0 CPUC reportable admissions of 100 acres or more. We put 180 miles of lines underground last year, exceeding our 175-mile target. And we chose to redirect capital investment to maximize risk reduction during the year, which changed our plans for gas main replacements. We exceeded our 2% annual O&amp;M cost reduction, offsetting inflation and delivering net savings of 3%. Yes, that is net of inflationary pressure. We see plenty of potential to continue 2% net O&amp;M reduction for many years ahead by working smarter and maximizing value for our customers and investors. Core EPS came in right on plan at 10%, while we delivered 6% rate base growth in what was the final year of our GRC cycle. Lastly, we were pleased that Moody's recognized our significant progress on mitigating risk and improving relationships in the state when they revised our credit outlook to positive earlier this month. On Slide 12, we introduced our 2023 report card. One key change is to our headline wildfire metric, where we're sticking with a target of 0 and resulting a new OEIS metric for catastrophic wildfires. This measure lines up with our future wildfire mitigation plans, and we think it's a better one for capturing events that are of real significance from both a customer and investor perspective. We remain committed to our 10,000-mile undergrounding goal and to achieving our unit cost targets. We'll be filing our 10-year plan later this year with more details. Our 2% O&amp;M reduction plan shouldn't be a surprise either, and there are no changes to any of our previous financial targets through 2026. We're excited to be adding another year, 2027, to our rate base and CapEx as we look to give you more visibility into our long-term plan. Our headline 5-year rate base CAGR of 9.5% remains the same, but it's now based off 2022 actuals and runs through 2027. We're feeling really good about what we accomplished in 2022, and we look forward to delivering for you again in 2023. With that, I'll hand over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items in more detail.Christopher A. FosterThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we delivered our financial commitments this year, landing at $1.10 in EPS for the full year 2022 and completed the year without issuing equity. We're also reaffirming our 2023 to 2026 earnings growth guidance and our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024. This morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap the drivers of our 2022 financial results and review our 2023 guidance drivers. I'll now provide some updates on how we're delivering against our simple, affordable model. Lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items. Let's start on Slide 13. As you can see in our full year walk, non-GAAP core earnings were $1.10 per diluted share for the year. We earned $0.07 from our customer capital investments and achieved $0.08 in savings from cost reductions. This allowed us to navigate the ups and downs during the year and deploy resources in our system for customers by pulling forward some work in future years and making other sound financial decisions to deliver right on target for the year. On Slide 14, as we showed you last quarter, we have planned for substantial customer investment in our 5-year plan, about 1/3 higher than the prior 5 years. We rolled this forward to include 2027. And as shown in orange, we're planning to spend almost 1/2 of our capital in the next 5 years on risk reduction across the enterprise. This includes system hardening, pipeline replacement and other work critical to reducing risk. We use a risk-based approach to prioritize our capital spend, addressing the highest risk and customer-centric work first. We are also focused on improving our capital to expense ratio over time. When we were able to do permanent repairs instead of temporary fixes, we improve that ratio and create headroom in the customer bill. This important work in our system also drives earnings per share growth and improves our cash flow from operations. And as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we've identified over $5 billion of incremental investment opportunity not yet in the plan. We would intend to bring some of this customer-focused spending into the plan as we work to create headroom on the customer bill. And using our simple, affordable model, we can deliver more risk reduction for every customer dollar spent because of our focus on lean, including waste elimination. Given the substantial capital opportunities in our plan, our pending 2023 General Rate Case and our focus on a return to investment-grade ratings, we intend to continue to show progress on our FFO to debt metric as you've seen on our report card slide. We landed at about 12.5% in 2022, showed some good progress there over where we ended 2021 at 10.9%. Moving to Slide 15. 2022 came with own set of challenges that we overcame. We saw inflation, rising interest rates, extreme heat, targeted supply chain shortages, natural gas price spikes, an unprecedented range. And yet, we found ways to stay on plan. And as Patti mentioned, the work of the teams to respond to the historic storms late last year and early this year was incredible. That's why we're so proud of what we are delivering for customers and for you, our investors, using our simple, affordable model. We are laser-focused on affordability and know you are, too. So let's dig a little further into the model. Through a series of good business decisions and the lean capabilities we're building, we were able to exceed our targeted 2% non-fuel O&amp;M reduction in 2022, delivering a 3% reduction despite inflation. And we use those savings to serve customers and derisk 2023. We saw significant savings for customers in vegetation management driven by improvements in unit costs due to a few strategic changes. First, we implemented a new accountability model and a consistent pricing structure that supports the integration of work while improving contractor oversight and warranties for rework. Then we also reduced our contractor counts from 24 to 14, implemented new subcontracting controls and regionalized work to build a stable and predictable plan. This should result in a better customer experience. There were repeat visits and lower cost to deliver for our hometowns while still meeting all our commitments. Through these efforts, we've saved around $200 million in vegetation management costs in 2022 relative to budget. And we expect to realize over $300 million in cost savings this year while still delivering the units in the base work plan with improved safety and quality. Also in 2022, we achieved an undergrounding average unit cost per mile, well below the $3.75 million target shared at Investor Day and the baseline of over $4 million from just a few years ago. And there's more opportunity for customers ahead. As you saw in our report card, our 2% non-fuel O&amp;M savings remains our annual target. We're just getting started finding cost savings for our customers, whether it be through improving our capital to expense ratio, eliminating waste from our processes or working with stakeholders to find better solutions for customers such as our self-insurance settlement. And as you can see in the 2023 plan column, we are continuing to aggressively pursue efficiencies to deliver our annual 2% non-fuel O&amp;M reduction, which similar to 2022 assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. While our 2% O&amp;M reduction target excludes fuel, I want to take a moment to reflect on the higher bills our customers have been experiencing this winter compared to last winter, largely as a result of higher natural gas prices experienced across the West Coast. Collectively, during the gas price run-ups in the winter, our procurement team was able to save customers well over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures, including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. To further support our customers, we've been going after bill relief strategies in partnership with federal and state regulators and policymakers. One example would be supporting the accelerated timing of the annual climate credit, which should put over $90 back in the pockets of our average combination electric and gas customer. Let's move to the top of Slide 16. As you saw through 2022, we're getting better regulatory and financial outcomes because we're delivering on our operational commitments and serving our customers better every day. Performance is power, and we own our performance. Our 2022 cost of capital was decided by the CPUC in Q4, leaving our 2022 ROE unchanged. We also received a final decision in our 2023 cost of capital as scheduled, providing further certainty as the 10% ROE approved applies through 2025. Last month, as requested, the CPUC approved our self-insurance settlement. We appreciate this decision as it allows us to avoid procuring costly wildlife insurance from the commercial insurance markets over at least the next 3 years, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. We also filed a Track 2 settlement in the GRC, which should help streamline the case procedurally with the schedule calling for a final decision in the third quarter. Our Pacific Generation application is moving through the CPUC process with a schedule that was released calling for a proposed decision no later than the end of November. While this could mean we don't get a final decision until 2024, we don't see the schedule set forth in the scoping memo, resulting in a meaningful change to our financial plan. We continue to view the sale as an opportunity to efficiently raise needed equity and a solution that benefit customers through realized tax benefits, which accelerate contributions to the customer credit trust. Moving to wildfire-related cost recovery. In 2022, we were authorized to collect $2.3 billion. The net unresolved balance is now approximately $4.7 billion, and I'm pleased to report additional progress on several cost recovery proceedings. First, our 2020 WMCE is now final, with those costs moving into rates. Second, we settled our 2021 WMCE resolving all elements apart from the cost in our vegetation management balancing account. Additionally, we filed our 2022 WMCE application and a motion requesting interim rate relief. Finally, on this slide, we are progressing through the next steps of 2 key pieces of legislation passed in 2022. In November, the Department of Energy confirmed Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program and conditionally awarded a total of $1.1 billion. We view the NRC staff decision last month to require a new application as procedural. And I note that our team has been working on a parallel approach from the outset. NRC staff expect to respond in March to our waiver request, which will allow for continued operation of the units beyond the current operating license expiration date. We're planning to file our new applications with the NRC before the end of this year. Lastly, 2 notes on our progress on resolving legacy legal claims. First, this week, we filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement reached with the SED resolving their investigation into the Zogg fire. We continue to assert, we were a prudent operator, and we've agreed to forgo cost recovery on $140 million, which will be invested over 3 to 5 years primarily in future system enhancements with a $10 million penalty going to the state general fund. Second, we've made some modest increases to our wildfire loss accruals for third-party claims this quarter, including $75 million for the Kincade fire, $25 million for the Zogg fire and $25 million for the Dixie fire. I'll remind you that our accrual for the Zogg fire is well within our available insurance. And we continue to book offsetting receivables for the accrual associated with the Dixie fire. For the Dixie fire, we've reached agreements to settle claims, including with the cities and counties. And we continue to work to fairly resolve individual claims through our fast claims process and mediation. In all of these cases, we remain committed to continuing to make it right for the communities and customers we serve. California has established legislative and regulatory processes to allow for constructive outcomes where we perform well. We recognize that we have a busy regulatory agenda with the CPUC, and we appreciate the commission's thoughtful consideration as we work relentlessly to achieve our safety and reliability goals as well as advancing California's climate leadership. Here on Slide 17, I want to take a moment to remind you that we have relatively limited sensitivity to some key variables outside of our control. Part of this is due to constructive California regulation, including decoupling for both gas and electric. Four elements provide for formulaic commodity recovery with timely cash collection, a 4-year General Rate Case cycle and a 3-year cost of capital cycle. Additionally, we're taking the initiative through our simple, affordable model and our focus on the bill, which we expect to further mitigate financial and regulatory risk as we continue to build trust with our customers, regulators and policymakers. Moving to Slide 18. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to report a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, so starting from the third quarter of 2020. For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items specified in our plan of reorganization. And as we step into 2023, we still expect to reach eligibility around midyear. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. Regarding our eventual policy, I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time. I'll wrap here by emphasizing that we met our 10% EPS growth target in 2022, no more and no less. And going forward, we continue to reiterate at least 10, 10, 9, 9. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.Patricia Kessler PoppeThank you, Chris. Let me close by emphasizing we've made a lot of progress in 2022. And yet, we are long away from being done. We have plenty more for you to look forward to in 2023 and beyond as we continue to write the next chapter in the PG&amp;E story. For our current investors and for those of you still taking a look, we hope you'll consider joining us in California for our 2023 Investor Day on May 24 in the Bay Area followed by undergrounding site visits in and around Napa County on May 25. We're excited to share more details of our longer-term financial plan and our investment opportunities. We'll roll up our sleeves to show some of our risk reduction tools and technology with you. And we'll also give you the chance to hear about our progress from some of our key California stakeholders. We can't wait to see you. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.Shahriar PourrezaJust real quick, Patti. In terms of the process and maybe establishing some framework around the Pac Gen equity sale, I mean, obviously, there's been some early stakeholder comments, and the CPUC narrowed down and issues list this year. I guess do you feel there could be an expedited resolution via some form of a settlement, partial settlement to move this process along faster?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes, Shar, we -- again, as we've been pretty clear about this, feel like the Pac Gen sale is a really good option for customers. It's a very efficient financing solution. Expedited might be a little overly ambitious. We know that the commission has a lot of input to take in from stakeholders, and we want to give them the appropriate time to do that review. Though we feel like we've made a really great case, and we feel good about the potential.Shahriar PourrezaAnd then obviously, you guys put out a mid- to high teens credit metric target. Is that -- just remind us, is that inclusive of the Pac Gen equity sale or not?Christopher A. FosterShar, that's true. The base plan does include the proceeds from Pac Gen. And as you can imagine, as we kind of more broadly look at the consistent view we've had on mid- to high teens by 2024 on FFO to debt, the real drivers there are probably going to be the GRC. You've got the wildfire recoveries that we touched on a little bit ago, and obviously, then just underlying CapEx profile as well. So I would think about those as really the drivers behind what we're looking at there for mid- to high teens.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. And then just lastly, Patti, I mean, obviously, one of the key messages for you on this call is like the bill impact is going to be sort of modest, let's just say, right? But some of the offsets and levers that you guys have been able to utilize and plan, which is a really good message. But there's still like, for instance, over $800 million in deferrals that are pending approval right now. I guess how does that kind of play into the equation?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. Thanks, Shar. I would say a couple of things. First, there's near-term bill pressure as I think people across the country are feeling with the commodity cost impact and what we're doing there. As Chris mentioned on the call, the state did a really good job, and kudos to the commission for pulling ahead the California climate credit for customers to, in the near term, offset the commodity impact. And we've obviously seen, like others, the commodity cost is back down into more normal range. And that bodes well for customers, and we feel good about that. But longer term, I think as we think about all of the necessary work for customers, this is why the simple, affordable model here at PG&amp;E is so important. For a long time, we were doing Band-Aid replacements and not doing the permanent corrective climate-resilient infrastructure investments our customers have been asking for. That's why undergrounding is so important. That's why our capital plan, we've given so much visibility to the capital plan because those investments in our infrastructure enable us to reduce our expense, improve that capital to expense ratio. Our 3% delivery of our O&amp;M savings this year, that's after inflation that factored in inflation, and then we still deliver 3% on top of that. That's just the beginnings of this team's capability to offset and reduce expenses to make the headroom for the necessary investments in truly climate-resilient infrastructure. This is a model that is really starting to play out here at PG&amp;E that will benefit customers from both their affordability. And as we layer in those legacy costs then they too will be offset by these cost savings that we're delivering. And so waste elimination is our theme this year, teaching people how to do more for less and really actually making the customer experience better at a lower cost is what the simple, affordable model delivers. And we're excited to be employing it here at PG&amp;E.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.Steven Isaac FleishmanSo I think you just answered my first question, Patti, which is that the -- when you talk about the O&amp;M costs, net of inflation, you're basically saying those are absolute costs. So even though inflation was up 6%, 7%, 8% last year, your costs were -- your O&amp;M was down 3%.Patricia Kessler PoppeYes, Steve. And we're proud of that, and I'm proud of the team for the hard work that they did, and we're just getting started, Steve. That's what's so exciting about this waste elimination and our story of the month about the new business. There is so much opportunity here, and the team is so hungry to learn. I'm so proud of them. I actually was in our waste -- our new business center just the other day where we're highlighting our waste elimination efforts. And that team was smiling for the first time in a long time, because they're realizing that they can, in fact, have the tools. People need to learn these techniques to actually reduce cost while they're doing more work, and people are really learning fast. I'm super proud of the team.Steven Isaac FleishmanShould we think of the waste elimination is like incremental to the O&amp;M costs of 2%? Or that's just part of -- or that's part of achieving the 2%?Patricia Kessler PoppeWell, it definitely enables us to deliver that 2% and all the inflationary pressures. So we call it 2%, but it's inflation plus 2%. And so that's what waste elimination delivers. And that, again, as we have ups and downs that come at us, that roller coaster I talk about, this is the capability that we can build into the team to turn on that capacity to reduce waste and absorb inflation and still deliver the 2% plus.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And then on the GRC, could you maybe just talk to the schedule for that? And is there likely to be any opportunities to settle either partial provisions of that further like the insurance or the case overall?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. So we've hit the stage where settlement is not really an option at this juncture. We've settled pieces and parts like the insurance because it was so valuable for customers to get that settled early and deploy those savings here in '23. And so as we follow the timetable that the commission has laid out, we're looking for a proposed decision and final decision in the third quarter. And we know that the commission has a lot on their plate, but we also know that this rate case is really important to customers and our ability to deploy all of the infrastructure investment that we've been talking about for the benefit of customers. So we expect timing to maintain the schedule that the commission has laid out.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Great. And then lastly, I just have to ask again, just any color -- new color from the fire victim trustee on just their kind of pace of payments and timing of remaining stock sales?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. No, we haven't really heard anything new. We know that the fire victim's trust is aligned with our interest of delivering safety for customers. As the company succeeds, it enables them to provide for the victims that are included in that trust. And so -- but no new information on timing on that front.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithListen, I wanted to kick it up first on a question related to '27. I know you guys rolled forward the 9.5% rate base CAGR at 2027, held back on commenting on EPS. I know you had this conversation about 10% or 9% in the past. You bifurcated that very clearly. I also appreciate the timeline of the current GRC and what that means for '27. But just asking the question, how do you think about '27 EPS growth and rolling forward the EPS CAGR as well, if you will?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. Julien, I think -- how I think about 2027 is the abundant investment opportunity that we have for the benefit of customers. So we've been pretty transparent with our at least 10, at least 10, at least 9, at least 9. We're going to continue on that EPS growth trajectory, but we need to -- our focus is on developing the best long-term capital investment plan that enables customers to have the infrastructure they've been waiting for and the cost mix by our cost savings that we continue to do that enable that investment without burdening customers too much on that affordability. So our eyes are definitely on a long-term infrastructure investment plan at the lowest cost possible for our customers.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. I would imagine, given the GRC and also, over time, kind of a normalization of the growth trajectories between rate base and EPS, perhaps the bias seems closer to 9 than 10?Patricia Kessler PoppeWell, we're just going to have to see, Julien.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithFair enough. Fair enough.Patricia Kessler PoppeWe're obviously thinking a lot mostly about derisking our system physically and making those necessary investments for customers.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAbsolutely. Understood. Listen, Patti, actually, since you mentioned this in the prepared remarks on the interconnections and your story, I thought it was very relevant given some of the feedback we're hearing. I'm curious to get your perspectives on what kind of load growth you're seeing. Where are you trending within that 1% to 3%? And can you comment maybe on some pent-up load growth that maybe because of those interconnection delays may not have been realized yet, if you will. But I also appreciate that the transportation electrification figures into that 1% to 3%. But overall, where are you trending against that prospectively, given some of these tailwinds?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. As we've said, we're looking at 1% to 3% load growth over time, more toward the back end of our plan than the front end, but we are seeing low growth. In fact, cut off the presses, Julien, we had 23% of all new vehicle sales in our service area in 2022 were EVs, 23%. I think that's a surprising number. That's up from 16% in 2021. So the EV evolution is definitely happening in California and definitely happening in our service area. In fact, the state was 20% EV penetration. We were 23% in 2022. So all that to say, we are very bullish on the EV role in load growth. Every EV is like half a house. So in other words, 2 EVs equals a new household in our service area. There is definitely load growth potential. Our forecasts reflect that. And you're right, we have to get really good at building out this capacity for our industrial and residential customers as more fleets electrify, big -- a school bus. So I was just -- in fact, we just were in one of the electric school buses last week. And that school bus is a megawatt, and Oakland Public Schools is planning to include electric school buses in their fleet. So here we are in our hometown, making sure that they're going to be ready, that's all opportunity for us. And so as we work with our regulators, making sure that we have a dynamic regulatory environment where we can, in fact, prepare for that capacity investment, be ahead of it is pretty exciting for customers. And so the interconnection, we're continuing to track with that investment, but we see real forecasted growth in the coming years, and that's exciting for us.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaI wanted to hit the undergrounding. So you've done about 300 miles now. You have this 10-year plan that's going to be filed soon, but you also kind of changed the GRC. I think there was an intra-quarter update, which might have removed some of the underground in capital. So I guess, first, can you just kind of comment on -- since you've progressed through this program, are you seeing pressures higher in cost? Or are you seeing efficiencies more from lessons learned? And then second, just how do we kind of think about your ability to hit the goal for roughly 2,000 miles with the shift in the GRC?Patricia Kessler PoppeGreat question. Of course, we're very excited about our undergrounding plan. And just a couple of good important clarifications for everyone. Number one, we reduced our mileage as a result of conversations with our key stakeholders. We have to earn the right to do that underground. We have to prove that we can, in fact, do it at the unit cost that we've described. Happy to report in 2022, the 180 miles we delivered was at a unit cost lower than we had forecasted. So the team is definitely improving on efficiency. And I feel like we're just getting started and really having the scope and scale of program that will consistently deliver the unit costs that we're forecasting. Our 10-year plan comes out later this year, and that will clarify mileage and unit cost targets. And I also want to remind everyone that, look, this undergrounding program is very important from a risk reduction and a customer satisfaction, but it's not a big bet. The undergrounding program is less than 20% of our total capital plan. It is flexible and dynamic in nature. We're going to be working with our regulators and those stakeholders to make sure that we do undergrounding at a pace that they support. I remind myself, the Golden Gate Bridge wasn't built in a year. It was built over time, and it's beloved, and that's what our undergrounding program is going to be. It's going to be built over time, and it's going to be beloved. And we have to earn the right to grow those miles year after year after year. And so we're very focused on doing that well. We've got a program structure set up that's delivered real savings in our wildfire mitigation through vegetation management inspections. The same leadership team is leading the undergrounding program. So we're expecting big things from Peter and the team as they build out our undergrounding program to the benefit of customers. I hope that helps.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaAbsolutely. I'm excited to see the plan as it comes together here. So just a quick question on the credit side. Congrats on getting the positive outlook, I guess, from Moody's. What is your understanding, I guess, of what the agencies are looking for now? Is it more time, another fire season to get back to IG here or is it more metrics-based because it does seem like the metrics are going in the right direction.Christopher A. FosterSure thing. Nick, I think it's -- in Moody's really reaffirmed this too that our financial metrics as we look at them are really already in that investment-grade territory. So I think really across the agencies, their emphasis is really shared on the physical risk reduction progress we're making. Patti hit the year-over-year improvements in our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and just the clear results of that delivers. And then I think also it's the desire to see continued progress and data points with our policymakers. Last year, we clearly made progress on some key customer-friendly programs, both the undergrounding program and the Diablo Canyon operating life extension in terms of new policy. And I think we just want to continue that progress this year. And that could be across wildfire-related recoveries at the CPUC, certainly our General Rate Case as well as the Pacific Generation filing there at the CPUC as well.Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroI was wondering if you could speak a little bit to the upside CapEx opportunities, the $5 billion that you laid out in terms of the transmission investment distribution. What could be kind of the timing of getting more concrete numbers around that? When -- could it hit the 5-year plan? Is it potentially kind of elongating the CapEx runway from here? And are there any like milestones that we might track as you evaluate some of those upside opportunities?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. Thanks, David. The point in sharing that potential upside is just to share that we have abundant capital infrastructure demand on the system. And so it is truly on us to find ways to offset costs. Everything that's in the bill that is unrelated to capital investment are areas of the bill that we can reduce in order to enable potential headroom then for that necessary customer benefiting infrastructure investment. So for example, we talked about this insurance settlement. That's a big savings for customers over time. That would be the sort of thing that creates headroom that we can enable additional capital without pressuring customers' bills. Now we filed a General Rate Case. It's important. That will be an important outcome later this year. That will provide more visibility to exactly what capital we have support from our commission to invest. And then we're going to continue to demonstrate this waste elimination capacity. So if we start to deliver greater than 2% O&amp;M savings or other savings that enable headroom, that creates the room for capital investment that doesn't pressure customer bills. This is the simple, affordable model in action. And it's dynamic in that way that if we additional -- find additional customer savings, then we'll work with our regulators to approve additional capital to deploy to the benefit of customers.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Understood. That's helpful. And then I was wondering your fire risk mitigation strategies, they're broad. There are a lot of different components of that. I was wondering if you could speak to innovation that you're working on with regard to fire risk reduction in terms of technologies or new applications that you're exploring right now that could be layered on to the current risk mitigation programs?Patricia Kessler PoppeWell, I'm so glad you asked because we're going to be highlighting that at our Investor Day in May, May 24 and 25. We'd love to have you out, and everyone on the call is welcome to join us. Some of the things that are pretty exciting are our partial voltage detection, which utilizes our smart meter technology for service line risk. We've got our down conductor technology. We're expanding the development of that program. Our teams have had some great breakthroughs in the last year. Kudos to our advanced technology team and all the hard work they've been doing. And you'll get to see a firsthand when you come out. So lots of innovation and technology, of course, all the data science that underpins our EPSS and our PSPS is really incredible to understand in more detail. And it's what gives us confidence heading throughout the year, whatever the environmental conditions around us, whether it's dry, it's wet, it's hot, it's cold, we're building infrastructure and the capability to adapt to those changing conditions and keep people safe. And I couldn't be more proud of the team and the progress we've made. We continue to make that progress, and we'll have it on display at our Investor Day here in May. Come on out and see us.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities.Richard Wallace SunderlandIt's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Just one quick follow-up on the $5 billion CapEx upside. Curious a little bit more around those opportunities and what the total bucket of possibilities are. Just really the $5 billion, is it sized for what you think you may be able to fold in over the near to medium term? And is there a larger opportunity set that you're still working through?Christopher A. FosterRich, happy to take it. I would take the second part first and say there is a larger opportunity set. But again, as Patti mentioned, keep in mind, our focus is absolutely on that overall simple, affordable model, which includes that affordability constraint for customers, right? So we've always got to keep that in mind as we go. As we look at the opportunities themselves, I really think that what we were mentioning earlier about the electrification growth is very unique for us. And so as we look at that, the EV penetration opportunity you explicitly see us call out in that $5 billion opportunity capacity-based investments. And that's really where we see targeted investments that we can make that will benefit the areas where you're seeing not just need for wildfire risk reduction, but also in some of those suburban communities where we're seeing a pretty dramatic EV uptake. So the opportunity there, I would say, do start to come in the medium term and only increase as we go further out.Richard Wallace SunderlandUnderstood. That's very clear. And then just one last one at the risk of, I guess, front running the Analyst Day update. Would that be the forum to address the EPS growth through 2027? I know this was asked earlier.Christopher A. FosterSure. I think I'll have to offer this to you. Come on out and see us. We do certainly plan on intending to give you more insight into that longer-term capital plan. But come on out, and we'll be able to share more at that time.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Gregg Orrill with UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillWhat in the Diablo Canyon extension process should we be watching for in the NRC and state levels?Patricia Kessler PoppeWell, first of all, we should be continuing to look for progress because we continue to make progress on that front. The NRC really does have an important job to do, and we don't want them to take any shortcuts. Their focus is on safety and making sure that Diablo Canyon will meet the safety expectations and standards. And so we'll work with them. We have a great relationship with the NRC, and we look forward to working with them on the relicensing process. That's an important part of the process. There's other several state-based regulatory proceedings that will be occurring. And I will remind everyone, we're -- we want to just send some gratitude and recognition to our state and to our state legislature and our governor for having the wisdom to suggest we extend the life of Diablo Canyon power plant. That is a high-performing nuclear facility, GHG-free baseload energy to the benefit of all of California. And so we definitely will be working closely with all of the different regulators to make sure that we make positive progress on that. And so that continues throughout the rest of the year.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi.Ryan Michael LevineA couple of questions for Patti. How has the hookup cancellation rate changed in the past year? How do you determine which interconnects to prioritize, given limited resources? And then, like in the comments around a new play to the playbook, are you looking at any changes to this process?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes, we're looking at changes every day to the process. Look, we've got to be easier to do business with. And I've had a couple of different sessions with our builders here in California. They are a key to California's prosperity. And therefore, we power them and they power California with new housing. And we're very much aligned with them. We're working with them to find accelerated tools and methods. And it's really amazing to see our new business process map and simple changes that can be made right away so that we don't have to make choices about who we're going to energize and who we're not. The question is about how do we energize people faster and streamline that process. And so as I shared, that example of these jobs, they get canceled for a variety of reasons, maybe the customer decides they're not going to do their project after all, having nothing to do with us. And we've done the full engineering. So we're looking at ways of doing a lighter engineering touch upfront just to give people the estimate that they need and making sure that we're only doing the engineering on the jobs that are going to get finished. That's a huge cost savings in hours and dollars. And it enables us to get the work done on time for the builders that are going to finish their projects. And so both capacity and new business are really exciting load growth opportunities for us, and the progress that we've made in a very short order is pretty impressive. We look forward to demonstrating that progress this year and continuing forward.Ryan Michael LevineAppreciate the comments. I guess I'm trying to get a sense in terms of quantifying the materiality of some of these delays between when you assumed your currency -- I mean, have you noticed any material changes in how customers have been interconnected or any color you could share around the progress that may be made on a go-forward basis?Patricia Kessler PoppeYes. I mean, I think we're seeing increased demand, which is great. There's building happening in California. People are talking about the exodus of California. I can tell you, I'm not feeling it. We're seeing a lot of growth here in customers and capacity. So the -- obviously, the additional electric vehicles that I pointed to is -- requires capacity investments at a substation level, but we also have transmission forecast of additional load. And we're continuing to see the opportunity to build more homes in broader spaces in California. And we're going to keep up with our building and our progress here at PG&amp;E. And that's what this lean operating system provides for us, the foundation to have visibility into our demand and our ability to eliminate the waste so that we can meet that demand. It's pretty exciting times here at PG&amp;E.OperatorWe'll take our next question from [Paul Fremont] with Ladenburg Dolman.Unidentified AnalystGreat. To start with, I was hoping to maybe get a little bit of an update on the Zogg trial. I guess the trial's due to begin in June. How long should we sort of expect before there would be a final decision reached in that proceeding? And in the past, I think you've indicated that the liability estimates could triple. Is that still sort of your view in terms of how much the liability could go up if you were found liable?Patricia Kessler PoppeThank you, Paul. First of all, on that subject, I just want to reiterate that our heart goes out to the victims of the Zogg fire and all of the wildfires. These environmental disasters are extraordinarily painful, and we don't take them lightly. And we're doing everything we can to make our system safer and faster. At the same time, I know that my coworkers are not criminals, and we don't believe that these are criminal matters. All that to say, we do -- the trial date has been set for June 6. We expect it to take about 6 weeks. And we don't expect additional liabilities because we actually plan to win. I think it's important to know that our coworkers, our vegetation management team works day in and day out to make the system safer and faster. And they have no other ambition than to do just that. So we plan to defend our position vigorously.Unidentified AnalystSo the trial would take 6 weeks, but the judge issuing a decision could take up to a year after that or...Patricia Kessler PoppeYes, Paul, it's hard to say. We'll obviously keep people posted as that goes.Unidentified AnalystIn terms of disallowed interest, can you sort of break out the liabilities or the disallowed rate base items that -- at the utility that go into that calculation?Christopher A. FosterPaul, it's Chris. I'm happy to work on that with you offline. I can actually give you the bill. As you know, we do a roll-up that's in the appendices of our materials, and I'm happy to spend time with you breaking that out. The undercoverable interest expense, as we noted today, ranges from $370 million to $430 million.OperatorAnd that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for any additional or closing remarks.Patricia Kessler PoppeThank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone, for your questions and your support. I just want to remind you all that your investment in PG&amp;E is an investment in California's safety and prosperity, and we thank you for that. We really appreciate your support. And we are definitely feeling the momentum here at PG&amp;E. We're proud of our performance in 2022, and we're writing the next chapter of our redemption story, and we hope you'll be along for the ride. We look forward to seeing you in California in May, please be safe out there.OperatorAnd that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

Yet, in certain metros among the country's 50 largest markets, renters can still find relative affordability, according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Rental Report released today.Oklahoma City, Okla. is the only metro among the 50 largest in the nation where renters can find a median-priced apartment for less than $1,000 a month. The report showed that Oklahoma City offered the lowest monthly rental price in January, at $982.There are 10 markets where median monthly rents are lower than $1,300, according to the report. Half are in the Midwest, four are in the South, and one is in the Northeast. None are in the West.The least expensive markets are:Oklahoma City, Okla. - $982Louisville, Ky. - $1,167Birmingham, Ala. - $1,178Rochester, N.Y. - $1,235Columbus, Ohio - $1,242Indianapolis, Ind. - $1,266Memphis, Tenn. - $1,274St. Louis, Mo. - $1,279Cleveland, Ohio - $1,290Kansas City, Mo./Kan. - $1,298Renters looking to take advantage of the best possible prices should move quickly. While the rents in these metros are the lowest among the 50 largest, for many of them, prices are increasing at a faster rate than in the rest of the country.""With high rents across the country, places that offer relative affordability tend to be in high demand, which means more competition and that these lower prices might not last,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Many of these metros have fewer available rental homes than previous months, and fewer apartments to choose from means prices are likely to go up. Cities including Indianapolis, Birmingham, Columbus, Kansas City, Cleveland, and Rochester are among the more affordable metros that experienced the fastest year-over-year price increases in January 2023, leaving few metros that are maintaining their current level of affordability.""Story continuesMany of these areas also have less rental availability than in past years, suggesting that affordable metros are increasing in popularity. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the average rental vacancy rate across these least expensive markets was 7.6% — a significant drop from the 9.7% vacancy rate in the fourth quarter 2017. However, seven of the most-affordable areas still had greater vacancy rates than the country's average, which was last tracked at 5.8% nationwide.Nationwide, rent growth for studio to two-bedroom properties continued to slow. Median rent was down 2.9% year-over-year, the lowest growth rate in 22 months.

As we close out our first full year as a stand-alone company and welcome in the new year, I want to reflect on our accomplishments and tremendous progress we've made. We started 2022 with our rallying cry, earn more fans, which is a broad-reaching aspiration that goes from our employees who are the foundation of our success to our MSP partners who are the primary focus of our business to industry stakeholders and investors. Through the solid execution of our strategy by our N-ableites across the globe, we believe we are successfully delivering on this mission.We achieved strong financial results, executed important initiatives across all product categories, and enhanced our broader platform experience for our partners. And we did all of this while laying the groundwork for future success. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong profits while simultaneously driving revenue growth, another clear proof point of the strength of our model and the robust demand for the mission-critical platforms and services we provide.In Q4, we exceeded the high end of our top and bottom-line guidance ranges, delivering revenue of $95.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $31.2 million, respectively. This equates to constant currency revenue growth of 13% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.6%. And for the full year, we achieved constant currency revenue growth of approximately 13% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.9%. We are pleased to deliver these results amidst an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Our MSP partners and their small and medium enterprise customers continue to deal with industry-specific headwinds of labor scarcity, increasing IT complexity in the move to the cloud, as well as the relentless growth of cybersecurity threats. Here at N-able, we believe we operate a resilient business model to deliver both growth and profit and provide core must-have software and services through an efficient platform experience and a genuinely partner-first approach.Our software is high in the IT priority stack, and customers have generally sought monitoring, data protection and security solutions regardless of the economic environment. We exist to make our partners more efficient, more effective and more secure or as we have said before, turning industry headwinds into tailwinds for both our MSP partners and for us. With regards to labor scarcity, the IT Trade Group CompTIA in December 2022 reported that the U.S. unemployment rate for technology occupations in all sectors stood at 1.8%, roughly half the national average.The difficulty SMEs have in hiring talent is compounded by the fact that IT is getting more complex and more mission-critical to business operations. SMEs face application and vendors problem, network challenges of hybrid work environments and moving workloads to the cloud. And cybersecurity continues to drive spending as well. Analysys Mason predicts that SMB security spending via MSPs will grow from $25 billion in 2022 to $48 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 14%. Together, these dynamics drive spending on managed services and software solutions. And as we are a premier software provider to MSPs, these trends directly fuel our business.Gartner observes these same market trends. In their IT spending worldwide report from December 2022, Gartner predicts that in every industry, IT spending on services will grow more quickly than spending on internal IT capabilities. Our product strategy is focused on creating tools that enable MSPs to solve technology pain points for their SME customers simply and securely. And importantly, in 2022, we executed this mission.Starting with monitoring and management, we listened to the needs of our market and adjusted our strategy to take advantage of the unique segmentation opportunity we found in tiering our offerings. We launched N-sight, which is our all-in-one offering aimed at early growth MSPs that include three major components of our platform. Our cloud-based RMM for monitoring and management, our N-able Take Control for remote support and MSP Manager for professional services automation, plus our full suite of onboarding, support and community resources to help them build their businesses. As a testament to the success of N-sight, on a currency-neutral basis contribution from new N-sight customers was up approximately 30% in 2022 compared to 2021.We also delivered additional Apple management capabilities to the N-sight platform to align with the growth of Apple devices. To give you an example of the increased customer value of this offering, in the fourth quarter, a European MSP was looking for an RMM platform. 2 critical customer criteria, which are to realize a short time to value, specifically that their technicians could be up and running quickly, and that the RMM tool could integrate cleanly with other software they use. After a competitive bake-off, the customer felt N-sight was the best fit for their needs and signed a $50,000 ARR deal.While N-sight focuses on the smaller end of the market, we have also reinvigorated our push on N-central, our RMM offering aimed at seasoned, larger MSP partners. In 2022, we added features and functionality to N-central, including new Apple management capabilities. We have seen strong proof of the power of N-central's orchestrate at scale, allowing MSPs to take on large workloads to manage devices, users and assets with a minimal amount of labor. We believe we lead the MSP market in enabling MSPs to manage Windows, Linux and Apple devices from one consolidated dashboard.As a result of our continued investment in growing our market leadership with N-central, our gross retention is up almost 2% year-over-year. Our Cove Data Protection offering launched in 2022 has also made considerable strides. Cove, which combined our already successful backup solutions with innovations such as our standby image feature, our true Delta technology and Mac document backup is no longer the best kept secret in data protection. As a cloud-first, enterprise-grade and truly SaaS offering, Cove is fast being recognized as a leader with MSPs and is starting to make inroads in the corporate IT space as well. A deal we closed in the fourth quarter of 2022 demonstrates the efficacy of Cove.One partner who is working with a midmarket enterprise that was about to begin migrating its Microsoft 365 from on-prem to the cloud. We worked closely with the MSP to demonstrate Cove's ease-of-use and cloud-first approach. As a result, they decided to move a large portion of their Microsoft 365 estate to Cove. This deal represented a nearly $100,000 ARR deal for N-able. Our data protection as a service approach seems to be resonating. On a currency-neutral basis, the contribution from new customer cohorts was up approximately 40% in 2022 compared to 2021. And we now have over 12,000 total partners using Cove Data Protection.In addition, Cove was recently recognized with the SEC Backup and Archive Innovation of the Year Award.Our security offerings also shined in 2022. As our suite of solutions has grown, we are now covering a broad spectrum of market needs, ranging from enterprise-grade EDR to traditional antivirus solutions, to password management and e-mail protection. Demand from SMEs grew as they sought security software during uncertain times in 2022, and many MSPs turn to us to meet that demand, so they could stack our enterprise-grade, fully integrated tools and grow their wallet share with their customers. We launched DNS filtering earlier in '22 and just announced the general availability of our managed EDR offering, which we soft launched in Q4.Managed DDR supplements the N-able EDR solution with dedicated management security services. With continued labor shortages and typically high cost of building and maintaining a SOC, managed EDR allows MSPs to affordably reinforce and extend their IT security teams powered by SentinelOne's 24/7 security operations center. This means they can more quickly investigate and resolve threat events for their SME customers, attractive always-on model. A great example of the appeal of our security solutions and the strength of our go-to-market motion was a deal we closed in the fourth quarter.A health care-focused MSP was having compatibility issues with their antivirus software and seeking to upgrade their security posture. Once we showed the MSP the benefits of EDR, integrated with N-central and the advantages of the enterprise-grade technology deployed simply, they signed a more than $100,000 ARR deal. This partner has been with us since 2017 and has consulted with us on how to price, package and market their business over the years. As I've discussed before, we take the word partner seriously. It is a distinction that must be earned and something we feel is a differentiator. We understand deeply that when our partners grow, we grow, something I call the snowball effect. So we are continuing to invest in the areas to help our partners better understand the nuances of their business and how to leverage the opportunities this sector holds.We will keep that focus because we believe it is paramount to our mutual success. Now as I have said before and will again, the focused execution of our strategy by N-able is across the organization is the root of our success. To recap 2022 highlights across the business. Our marketing teams packaged and launched our Cove Data Protection and N-sight platforms. Our fourth quarter total bookings were high for the year and exceeded our Q4 '21 figures. We earned our partner fandom every day, and it showed up as we increased our dollar-based gross revenue retention across the business by 130 basis points on a constant currency basis. Our R&amp;D and service teams brought six new products and billable services to market, including N-sight, Cove standby image, managed EDR, DNS filtering, cloud user hub and enhanced services. We opened our Warsaw Poland office with more than 70 employees currently based there, expanding our presence in Europe. And our business development efforts brought us key strategic capabilities, including the Spinpanel acquisition that we completed in July.We are laser-focused on delivering on our mission to empower the success of MSPs across the globe. Thank you to more than the 1,400 N-ableites who tirelessly personified are rally cry, earning more fans every day. Turning to 2023. We are still committed to earn more fans. We believe we are well positioned to take it to another level. This year, we will focus on raising the bar and our quest to become the vendor of choice for MSPs across all sizes across the globe. We expect to continue to elevate our go-to-market efforts, earn new partners and grow our brand presence and awareness. We are also leveling up our commitment to improving our partner success resources and services in driving new product launches and enhancements throughout the year to help our partners win and grow their customer base.The elevating force behind our strategy in 2023 continues to be the industry tailwinds that we believe are still firmly in our favor. Our focus will be on raising the bar in three key areas. The first is what we call manage everything. As our partners are looking to help their SMEs navigate the ever-changing technology landscape, we are focused on enhancing our solutions to give them the tools to become even more mission-critical. In 2023, we will look to augment cloud monitoring and management capabilities, extending into Azure management and broadening our Microsoft 365 management. This will help MSPs bridge the divide between server-based and cloud assets. And just as customers need help with Azure and Microsoft 365, they need help managing their Microsoft licenses.Cloud user hub based on Spinpanel technology, which we acquired last year, does just that. Increasing our capabilities for Apple device management is another important avenue of growth. With Mac market share gains, far outpacing PCs, the ability to manage and monitor Apple environment is a strong value add to our MSP partners. We believe this added functionality will make us the single vendor for end-to-end Apple and Microsoft coverage for monitoring, data protection and endpoint security. And as we go through 2023, I look forward to updating you on our journey to manage everything.As we all know, managing IT assets is critical but not enough. And that's why the second focus area for our MSPs is protect and secure. In 2023, we plan to further execute on the full potential of Cove Data Protection, expanding into broader Azure and Microsoft 365 use cases, along with continued investment in underlying product functionality. These investments will better position us to ride the wave of demand for enterprise-grade, cloud-first, integrated data protection solutions. Protection and security go hand in hand. And this drives the trend we see with Cove as an entry point for many prospective MSP partners. And a delighted Cove customer has often turned into N-able for other solutions as well.Recently, we were talking with a top 10 partner about security in the MSP business, and we thought they summed it up perfectly when they said, ""We love what you have, but give us more."" We intend just to do just that. We see a growing convergence in endpoint management and security and are working on adding new solutions to identify security risks in the environments we already manage. Look to hear more from us in 2023 on the security front.And finally, the key area is what we refer to as operational efficiency, which is helping our partners through automation and standardization with N-able as their one-stop shop for fulfilling their business goals. Standardization for the MSP mean software cost consolidation, improved technician efficiency and significant time savings. As we work with our partners to automate their processes using our tools, they can accelerate their customers transition to the cloud, stack more solutions to increase the value they provide and scale their growth in efficiency seamlessly. For us, this implies a significant cross-sell opportunity within our existing base, but also the potential for growing our market share. Once again, as our partners grow, we grow.Our market is resilient. Our positioning and strategy are on target, and our focus is clear. We look forward to delivering updates on our strategic initiatives within these focus areas throughout the year.And I will now like to turn the call over to Tim to discuss our financial results and outlook.Timothy James O’BrienThank you, John. and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. I want to start by recognizing the many accomplishments of our team in 2022, including enhancing our product capabilities, bringing new offerings to market and successfully operating in an evolving macroeconomic environment throughout the year. I look forward to building on this foundation in 2023.Now I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $95.8 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth or 13% on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue was $93.4 million, representing approximately 7% year-over-year growth or 13% on a constant currency basis. Other revenue, which primarily represents maintenance revenue from our discontinued perpetual license model was $2.4 million, up 5% year-over-year.We ended the quarter with 1,898 partners that represent $50,000 or more of ARR, a 13% year-over-year increase. Partners with over $50,000 of ARR now represent 51% of our total ARR, up from 47% a year ago. Dollar-based net revenue retention, which is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis was 103%. On a constant currency basis, dollar-based net retention held steady quarter-over-quarter at 108%.For the full year, we finished 2022 ahead of our outlook with total revenue of $371.8 million, representing approximately 7% year-over-year growth or 13% on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue was $362.6 million, representing approximately 98% of total revenue and growing approximately 8% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis.Turning to profit and margins. Note that unless otherwise stated, all references to profit measures and expenses are calculated on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the items outlined in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations provided in today's press release. Also note that historical financials for the period prior to the effective spin-off date of July 19, 2021, included operating expenses that were prepared using our carve-out allocation methodology while we were still a part of SolarWinds.While the allocations and estimates in these carve-out financials are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable, our stand-alone financials are not necessarily directly comparable to those prepared prior to the effective spin-off date. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $31.3 million coming in well ahead of the high end of our outlook, representing 32.6% adjusted EBITDA margin. Full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $114.7 million, which represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.9%. Fourth quarter gross margin was 85% compared to 86.6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year 2022 gross margin was 85.2% compared to 86.8% in 2021.The key drivers of the decline are changes in foreign exchange rates, product mix and new product investments. Unlevered free cash flow was $74.9 million in 2022 and $17.6 million in the fourth quarter. Unlevered free cash flow for the year represented 65% conversion from adjusted EBITDA. CapEx was $21 million or 5.7% of revenue for the full year and $7.8 million or 8.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter. CapEx in the fourth quarter included the impact from a strategic asset purchase.Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.10 in the fourth quarter based on 182 million weighted average diluted shares and $0.34 for the full year based on 181 million weighted average diluted shares. We ended the year with $98.8 million of cash and had an outstanding loan principal balance of $345.6 million, representing net leverage of approximately 2.2x based on trailing 12-month EBITDA.Before turning to our 2023 outlook, I want to give some commentary on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as share some thoughts about the state of our business. The fourth quarter beat on revenue was driven by strong demand for solutions across all categories. Relative to our stated guidance rates, we also saw FX favorability in the quarter, which drove approximately half of the $2 million beat. The strong adjusted EBITDA output in the quarter is a function of the flow-through of the revenue beat to the bottom line, some seasonal fluctuations in spending and a reduction in force that represented less than 5% of our workforce.The decision to take this action was a difficult one to make, was done across the company and not focused on any particular function or location. As we came to year-end, we wanted to ensure our business and teams were best positioned for future growth and success in 2023 and beyond with the right levels of investment in resources.Now I will provide our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $97.5 million to $98 million, representing approximately 7% to 8% year-over-year growth or approximately 11% to 12% on a constant currency basis. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA in the range of $29 million to $29.5 million, representing approximately 30% margin at midpoint. For the full year 2023, we expect total revenue of $408 million to $412 million, representing 10% to 11% year-over-year growth or 11% to 12% growth on a constant currency basis. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $122 million to $126 million or approximately 30% to 31% margin.With the continued macro uncertainty and variability we saw in 2022, we are assuming FX rates for the remainder of 2023 of $1.04 for the euro and $1.17 for the pound. For full year 2023, we expect CapEx to be approximately 6% of revenue and adjusted EBITDA conversion to unlevered free cash flow to be approximately 65%, both in line with 2022.As a reminder, our debt is floating and currently fixed to LIBOR. We will transition to SOFR in 2023, and we anticipate approximately $30 million of interest expense for the full year which assumes an effective interest rate of approximately 8%. We expect total weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 183 million for the first quarter and approximately 184 million for the full year. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 27% to 28% in both the first quarter and the full year.To recap, we saw strong market demand in Q4, and we are confident in our strategy and positioning as we enter 2023. We believe the outlook we provided for the first quarter and full year account for the current macro environment. As a reminder, our model has many different growth vectors, including new customer acquisition, cross-sell of our existing product suite into our partner base, launching new product offerings and capacity growth. We will continue to monitor the performance of all aspects of the model.Our 2023 operating plan calls for continued investment in our growth and it is important to reiterate that our business model allows us to be nimble and adapt to these plans if we see changes in the demand environment. We believe strongly in the long-term secular trend of SME IT spend and managed services growth, and we intend to continue to invest in important strategic areas outlined by John earlier in a profitable and sustainable manner.Now I'll turn it over to John for closing remarks.John PagliucaThank you, Tim. As we dive into 2023, the leadership team and our fellow N-ableites are energized by the potential we have to make a real impact for our partners and for their SME customers. We will raise the bar to deliver solutions and services that are purpose built for the MSP market. And as previously mentioned, we are focused on enabling MSPs to manage everything, protect and secure, and elevate their operational efficiency. We believe we have positioned ourselves optimally to provide the solutions that MSPs need to alleviate the pain points for SMEs to grow as they grow and to continue to adapt ahead of the curve, riding these industry trends well into the future.We believe that we have an all-weather business model to deliver both growth and profit, and we will continue to provide core, must-have software and services to MSPs through an efficient platform experience. Our focus is sharp, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our vision.With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) First question is taken from Mike from Needham &amp; Company.Michael Joseph CikosI guess first topic I wanted to delve into what would really be the guidance that we have here for calendar '23 with the 11% to 12% constant currency revenue growth. Can you help us think through like what gives you the confidence to guide to that 11% to 12% FX-neutral revenue growth? And then the second, like really what I'm trying to dig at is, as some of the puts and takes that the team weighed in deriving that growth forecast. Can you help us think through that?John PagliucaYes, sure. Mike, this is John. So the -- Tim outlined the dynamics of our business model nicely in the prepared remarks, right? And it starts with that gross retention number and those 25,000 MSPs that continue to be part of that snowball as I like to say. So the start of the foundation there is on that gross retention. We continue to see the strength in our platform and the dependency, frankly, that our MSPs have on the mission-critical platform that they use to service their customers. So the base there is that our gross retention is on the uptick and that the customer satisfaction continues to be high. And that gives us our base.If you think about our revenue snowball, it's in the mid-90s percent of our business comes from our existing base, the retention of the customer base and then the expansion there. And we continue to see the second leg of our MSP partners buying more services from us. Our data protection, we noted the penetration that we're getting at the MSP level. There continues to be a lot of white space as they continue to adopt Cove across their base. Our MSPs are continuing to add on our security services, and we've got really good traction. But again, there's continued significant white space in our endpoint security and our DNS filtering and our mail security. So we look at the traction and success of our cross-sell motion and the white space that's not just for us, but also our MSPs. And that's really the base of our revenue and the base of the forecast.We have strong views into each of the cohorts and the consistency of the cohorts, and that's the foundation. And then, of course, Mike, like every business, we take a look at the velocity and the demand for new customer acquisition. And I think we did a good job being prudent along that line and not necessarily leaning forward as far as new customer acquisition. But again, that's not as significant part of our snowball revenue there. So that's -- those are the different dimensions, and that's how we looked at the year. And that's how we always look at the year, Mike. And it starts with looking at the customers by geo, by segment as we talked about the smaller end, the larger end and building based on the cohort growth from there.Michael Joseph CikosThat's great. And if I could just build on that for a second. Like I know you were talking about the gross retention, and we got the fact that the net revenue retention, again, on an FX-neutral basis was consistent quarter-to-quarter at that [108], right? So as we look at calendar '23, are you assuming improvements in either that net retention rate or that gross retention rate?Timothy James O’BrienNo, Mike, I would say the guidance assumes that we hold both fairly steady in the 2023 outlook.Michael Joseph CikosGot it. Got it. And then one more, if I could, before I turn it over to my colleagues. But I know that -- I think on closing out the guidance comments, you guys have discussed this sub-5% workforce reduction that you had put in place. Can you help us think through what the expected cost benefit to N-able was as a result of that reduction? And then the second question is, I know that previously, the company has spoken about hiring whether it's revenue-generating sales folks or anything of that sort. So is the company still hiring post risk? And like if you are, where are those more strategic areas where you continue to build -- I guess, build expertise and those different department functions?John PagliucaSure, sure. Again, this is John, Mike. Short answer is we continue to lean in and we're hiring. And we're hiring in those key areas that you touched on, quota-carrying sales folks but also in R&amp;D. And we're a technology company. And in the prepared remarks, we talked about staying at or ahead of the curve, providing MSPs the ability in this ever-changing technology landscape to have the tools that they can have to meet that changing environment, right? So we're leaning in on R&amp;D. We have a -- we continue to hire there. That's probably our highest area of recruiting effort right now.As it relates to the reduction in force, as Tim mentioned, we do take these things seriously. But a reminder, we just concluded our first year as a public company. We just concluded our first year as a company in 2022. And when you do that, you make some investments, you make some hires, you build for a certain bit. And then when we came into our planning cycle in 2023, we looked at areas that we wanted to invest in more, we looked at some functions where we had some scale and some efficiency, and we made some difficult decisions. But overall, you'll see us from a net point of view, adding heads in 2023, and we expect to be at a higher head count rate at the end of this year than we did in 2022.So net-net, we'll be hiring more, bringing more N-ableites, pushing that technology agenda forward and hopefully at a faster clip than we even did in 2022, which was pretty impressive considering we brought on six new offerings in the last year.Michael Joseph CikosGot it. Got it. And just to cycle back to the earlier comment on the RIF. Did you guys quantify what the cost benefit of that RIF was? And then I guess, when was that implemented? Or is there still more to come as far as communicating that to the affected folks?Timothy James O’BrienMike, yes, we didn't communicate the savings, but I would say, as John hit on it was mostly done to shift where some of our investments were as we went into 2023. That being said, we did execute it within Q4, and we did see some savings within the quarter that I would say, perpetuated some of the profit beat and the margin acceleration probably to the tune of about 50 to 100 basis points in the quarter.OperatorWe now turn to Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.Matthew George HedbergJohn, in the past, we've talked about RMM. I think it's like $1 to $3, maybe a couple of bucks per device. I think what stood out to me is all of the innovation that you guys talked about, the six products sort of launched last year. Can you talk about what that potential is on a per device basis as you sort of expand this broader platform?John PagliucaSure. Yes. And the economics of the business, it really goes to the root of the business model, Matt. So I appreciate the question. And so -- you're right. So the remote monitoring piece, depending on the size and some of the scale of the MSP, it can range from $1 to $3 per month per device. When you stack all of our offerings up, that number gets closer to about a $15, $16 per device per month, SAM, so to speak, if you will, within our existing customer base, right? And so that, by the way, is a pretty impressive number. If we were to cross-sell and get 100% adoption across every device, that's well over $1 billion of additional opportunity inside our existing base with our existing solutions today.And that's before, Matt, we added managed EDR and before we -- as we continue to add new offerings. So EDR is a good example. We'll increase our endpoint security. Historically, endpoint security on an antivirus bit was potentially as low as $1 per month per device with EDR, that's a couple of dollars as we continue to add more goodness in helping MSPs become more efficient and more secure with endpoint security, that revenue, that ASP per device stacks to as high as potentially $7 per device.So there's a tremendous amount of white space there in endpoint security. MSPs do a great job packaging that up and selling that to the SME. We have compliance and cyber insurance companies mandating services like EDR for companies that want to get underwritten. And so we see that as a tremendous white space opportunity, both for N-able and for our MSP partners. And that's the name of the game here. We continue to add MSPs, they add small, medium enterprises. They keep adding to well over 0.5 million SMEs and the well over 7 million devices that we have. And then we add new services for them to cross-sell and to their customers and grow that cross-sell number for N-able. And so there's a good amount of, I'd call it, very much early innings as far as our ability to keep continuing to cross-sell into our base.Matthew George HedbergGot it. Yes. Yes. It certainly seems like that per device opportunity continues to go up, which is great. And then Tim, maybe on the capital allocation side, you talked a little bit about the RIF. As you approach '23, how do you think about capital allocation between, maybe, continue to delever -- or are you at the level that you need to be, M&amp;A, just sort of just general capital allocation philosophy entering there?John PagliucaYes, Matt. The way we think about it is looking at the capital markets today, I would say we have favorability compared to the current rate environment. So based on that, based on kind of our leverage rate, we feel comfortable with where we're at as well as being able to look at anything strategic as we go through 2023 as well. So our plan as of now is we're kind of comfortable with where we're at, happy with where we're at, continue to evaluate it as markets change. But for 2023, based on kind of where we're at and where the markets are at, I would say, we plan to kind of stay the course.Matthew George HedbergCongrats on the strong year-end.Timothy James O’BrienThanks, Matt.OperatorWe now turn to Jason Ader from William Blair.Jason Noah AderI want to ask you first about the -- just the macro environment. How is this period different than what we saw kind of post -- kind of early days of COVID in terms of demand? And then maybe just some comments on U.S. versus Europe.John PagliucaSure. Jason, John here. So compared to COVID, there's some similarities, and I'll touch on those and tease out some of the differences. So in COVID, what we saw is that MSPs were logging into our platform at 2x the rate they were before COVID. And that really spoke to how mission-critical our platform is to these MSPs and helping them because that created a spike in helping them effectively push their small, medium enterprises into that remote work environment, into that digital kind of evolution that we speak to.And financially from the business, we saw an uptick in strong demand from data protection and security as MSPs prepared their customers for that new world. During COVID, we saw a slowdown in new customer acquisition. Our MSPs, whether they be N-able MSPs or MSPs broadly speaking focused on their customer base and not on new platform changes, right? They didn't have the time for that. Compared now to the environment that we're in, we continue to see really strong demand for our data protection and security services. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, relatively speaking, security spend is a resilient part of the industry. So we continue to see a strong demand, both in data protection and security.But unlike COVID, where MSPs didn't have the time to look at new platforms, we're seeing MSPs look at new RMM platform. So we're -- compared to COVID, we're doing much better from an NCA point of view as it relates to both platforms. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks N-sight. We repackaged N-sight in 2022 from a pricing and packaging, but more importantly, from a user experience point of view to help these MSPs become more efficient. And as a result, you saw that strong uptick in that cohort that I mentioned where we're landing much more customers in that lower end than we did last year.So relative to COVID, I would say, NCA is stronger, and our cross-sell motion is as strong as it was in COVID. And the retention piece is stronger than what it was at COVID. And COVID, we saw maybe a little bit on the low end of the market some atrophy there where folks might have just been going out of business, and we're not really seeing that. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, gross retention is stronger.As it relates to geo, while we said demand was strong across all service areas, nothing really to call out from a geography point of view as well. We continue to perform well in our Asia Pac. And Asia Pac for us is primarily Australia and New Zealand, and in our European markets as well. So nothing really to call out as a differentiator. It's been pretty consistent both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. As it relates to Q4, it was strong and pointing up and to the right.Jason Noah AderGreat. Great. And then just as an unrelated follow-up, how do we think about the threat from Microsoft Intune to your RMM business? And to just the RMM category as a whole, it just seems like Microsoft is well positioned there. They're getting a tremendous amount of adoption of Intune across the market. I don't know specifically if there's something about it that wouldn't be well suited for MSPs. But how do we think just over the next like 3 to 5 years about the potential threat from Intune?John PagliucaYes. We have a good working relationship with Microsoft, actually. And Intune is not in RMM and you can talk to any MSP, any technician actually, you can look at a Reddit thread right now that's going on. And Intune is not an RMM and Microsoft knows that. We work closely with Microsoft because we believe we provide an experience with the MSP. We always emphasize, [Matt], this concept of purpose built, right? That means it's architected in a way that MSPs can look across, they can look at one particular user or one account, one small, medium business across their entire account or their entire estate. And the fact that we're architected in a way that gives them a consolidated view and look across their entire environment and provide them with alerts and automation to help them run their businesses efficiently is where we stand up.So we actually integrate with Intune. We actually pulled the Intune experience, the Microsoft 365 experience. And later this year, the Azure experience into our platform. Microsoft has many clouds, as you know. And our job is to help integrate that for one experience so that the MSPs, if you think about it, we're this aggregator and whether they're using Microsoft operating systems, a Linux operating system or Apple devices, we need to provide that single pane of glass that one standard. And more importantly, a bunch of automation so that they can roll out their rules and policies and alerting in one single manner.And so that's where we differentiate. So our product teams and our dev teams work along with the Microsoft teams to help them. And in addition, as it relates to data protection and security, Microsoft right in their terms and conditions, suggests that customers use a third-party cloud-based backup offering to back up their data as well for an extra layer of security. So we have a good working relationship with them. We look at the relationship in the way we can differentiate and help MSPs get more efficient is the reason why they continue to use us in concert with the Microsoft cloud offerings that they have.Jason Noah AderAnd then one quick one for Tim before I wrap up here. Tim, can you break down the product mix for us? I know you've done that in the past between RMM and security and backup and PSA.Timothy James O’BrienWe've never broken down the mix, at least -- what we've done is give color on just kind of the growth of those segments. And I would say the story is kind of unchanged there where both the data protection and security parts of the business are growing faster than overall revenue. And based on the demand we see, expect that trend to kind of continue into the beginning of the year here as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Essex from JPMorgan.Brian Lee EssexI was wondering if I could maybe ask about your over $50,000 MSPs. So I guess on the larger side, how should we think about the margin contribution from those MSPs as you grow? It looks like you're adding them at a pretty good first year, just maybe compared to the smaller ones that you service.Timothy James O’BrienYes. So that stat is a combination of a couple of things. You're not wrong. We continue to add large MSPs, but the beauty in our model is we can also land an MSP giving us, let's say, $12,000 of ACV. And then as they're growing and adding more SMEs, they grow, but then as we were talking about with the previous question, then we're adding in the additional services. So a lot of times, when we're getting that increase in the numbers because an MSP is increasing their ACV to us via a successful cross-sell. So when they add data protection, when they add endpoint security, the LTV of the customer doubles and sometimes triples as they keep adding these important services to their business.So it really speaks to two things. Our ability to win and we continue to do quite well at the high end of the market with our win rate there. But it really speaks to the success we have with our partnership in growing and as they add more services. And so it's a combination of those two things and why we refer to it as a snowball and we're growing as they're growing.From a contribution margin, I'd say our cost to retain is much better than the industry because of the stickiness in our model because it's a partner-led growth. A lot of our growth comes not from us selling into the MSP, but from them adding services and selling into the SME. In some ways, think about it this way, our 25,000 MSPs and the 250,000 technicians that are working for those MSPs effectively become our sales force. So as we give them goodness like managed EDR and our other -- our DNS filtering and help them package that, now they go off and sell to the SME these security services, add to their book of business with their existing customer base. And as a result, they trip over that $50,000 mark. So that's an important number for us as it shows the health of the partnership and that snowball effect growing. Hopefully, that helps.Brian Lee EssexYes. No, super helpful makes a lot of sense. And I guess how do we think about the profitability given the, I guess, higher catch rates of those over $50,000 MSPs relative to what the rest of the customer base looks like?Timothy James O’BrienSo I'm not sure there's -- so the shape of the higher ones, so they actually have a higher initial sale. The bigger MSPs have a higher sales. So I'd say the breakeven period to the larger MSPs is actually quicker than some of the smaller MSPs. Like N-sight customers that we talked about before, they come in usually with a lower ASP and their breakeven period has a little bit of a longer slope. But because of the power of the model because of the way that the technology works, it really -- whether they're a small MSP or a large MSP, the unit economics are quite strong. And that's given off the strength of our low cost to retain, which I think is evident in the fact that we have the 30% EBITDA margins, right?John PagliucaYes. And Brian, just to add, if you think like an LTV to CAC ratio on that customer base, it's definitely more favorable than the lower end of the market. And also, if you look at retention rates, as you go up the stack in our customer base, gross retention rates are higher with our larger customers, they're higher within that customer segment of $50,000 ARR and greater as well. So that obviously is a tailwind to that LTV to CAC ratio as well. So probably just some additional information there to kind of think about the longer-term profitability of those customers.Brian Lee EssexYes, that's helpful. I'm just trying to determine are you at some kind of an inflection point now that it makes those customers comprise more than 50% of our ARR. And then I guess with regard to the previous question on, I guess, level of confidence in the guidance for 2023. How much visibility do you get from your MSP customers in terms of what they're seeing for demand on their platform? And do they give you kind of inputs into what your planning process looks like for 2023? Just wondering at the level of communication there.John PagliucaSo we have 25,000 MSPs all across the globe. We have I'd say, a high frequency from a contact point of view across the base. We've invested in partner success over the last couple of years to increase a little bit more of that high-touch relationship and bringing in growth specialists to help the MSPs grow. So I'd say we have a good sense from the customer base with our partner success teams as far as what their growth areas are. And what I'll tell you is the MSPs, generally speaking, and of course, there is exceptions, are really focusing on growing their wallet share. That was true in 2022 as well. But what we're seeing is for MSPs and if you think about it with labor scarcity, an MSP -- when an MSP adds customers, it typically means they'll need to add a technician, right? Not at a 1:1, but there's some linearity or correlation there.But when an MSP adds a service, especially if they're leveraging an N-able service, they're growing the wallet share of their customer base, growing their top line, growing their profit and not necessarily dependent on adding labor. That's why managed EDR as an example, is an important thing for them. They can grow their wallet share, it will help them with their efficiency. So we -- I believe we'll continue to see strong demand from a security and data protection point of view. And that's a lot of the feedback that we get is that they're looking at focusing growing their wallet share as that.But when I spoke to the MSPs, I'd say, a couple of quarters ago at our Empower event, which is our first live event that we did in a couple of years due to COVID, the demand is quite strong, and it aligned with what I was talking about, strong demand for data protection, strong demand for security and their strategy aligned with either growing their wallet share and/or adding more security services.Brian Lee EssexGot it. That's helpful. And then -- so I appreciate that. And maybe last one for me to kind of pivot off of that on the wallet share. What are you seeing out there in terms of MSP consolidation? And how does that compare with prior trends? And how might that impact your business going forward, either as your customers consolidate with other MSPs or potentially on the lower end, maybe they get acquired by other MSPs?John PagliucaGreat question. So I often say our TAM is not defined by the number of MSPs in the market. Our TAM is truly defined by that IT spend from the SME. And when two MSPs consolidate, really nothing happens to the TAM that's out there, right? And in fact, what usually happens is that MSPs, the larger they get and we're seeing MSPs now that are over $1 billion in revenue. Some are publicly traded. They're backed by private equity. They're backed by venture capital. They're getting, I'd say, much more mature in their business approach. What's happening is the ceiling of which the customers that they're selling into has gone higher over the last couple of years. So we're seeing MSPs now selling into Fortune 1000 companies. And as a result, where -- when Tim and I got into the space 10 years ago, MSPs were primarily focused on small and medium enterprises that were 50 employees and down.But now that the industry has matured, they have matured. The consolidation has forced a little bit more maturity. Our tech has allowed them to go up the stack. And now they're selling into mid-market. They're selling in with a co-managed bit to the Fortune 1000. So actually, it's somewhat counterintuitive, but as the consolidation happens, MSPs are going up the stack, raising that bar and potentially gaining them access to a bigger IT spend as they do that. Typically speaking, at N-able, the larger the MSP, the more our N-central product stands up and our win rate actually is better at the higher end because of the power that gives them the ability to orchestrate at scale.And so -- and you asked for -- I answered your second question first. Your first question, do we continue to see consolidation. Yes. We continue to see that. Like your guess is as good as mine with rising interest rates, obviously, for MSPs and for everyone buying power somewhat gets degradated, right? And so I haven't seen a slowdown yet, but it's probably not crazy to assume that as -- with rising interest rates, it will put a little bit more pressure or scrutiny on acquisition. But MSPs continue to be acquisitive, and they do so because they're -- sometimes they're buying tech, sometimes they're buying a customer base or geography. And there's a bunch of goodness when these MSPs do that. It helps them drive scale and help them drive efficiency and ultimately drive their bottom line.OperatorThis concludes our Q&amp;A. I'll now hand back to John Pagliuca, CEO, for any closing remarks.John PagliucaThank you, operator, and thank you all for joining and listening in to the fourth quarter results. We look forward to providing an update in another quarter or so. Thank you, and have a great day.OperatorThis call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation.

(Richard Drew / Associated Press)After 17 years as the publisher of short science fiction and fantasy stories at Clarkesworld, the online and print magazine he founded in 2006, Neil Clarke had become adept at winnowing out the occasional plagiarism case from the hundreds of submissions he receives every month.The problem ticked up during the pandemic's lockdown phase, when workers confined at home were searching for ways to raise income. But it exploded in December, after San Francisco-based OpenAI publicly released its ChatGPT program, an especially sophisticated machine generator of prose.Clarke reckons that of the 1,200 submissions he received this month, 500 were machine-written. He shut down submission acceptances until at least the end of the month, but he's confident that if he hadn't done so, the artificial pile would have reached parity with legitimate submissions by then — ""and more than likely pass it,"" he says.This whole craze has taken over the world, and everyone's in a frenzy.H. Holden Thorp, Science editor-in-chief""We saw no reason to believe it was slowing,"" says Clarke, 56. As he has done with plagiarists, he rejected the machine-generated content and permanently banned the submitters.A veteran of the software industry, Clarke has developed rules of thumb that enable him to identify machine-written prose; he doesn't share them, out of concern that simple tweaks would allow users to circumvent his standards. ""They'd still be bad stories and they'd still get rejected, but it would be 10 times harder for us.""Regulatory systems have scarcely begun to contemplate the legal implications of programs that can trawl the web for raw material, including the prospect of widespread copyright infringement and fakery in prose and art.The appearance of authenticity ""will make generative AI appealing for malicious use where the truth is less important than the message it advances, such as disinformation campaigns and online harassment,"" writes Alex Engler of the Brookings Institution.Story continuesThe onslaught of machine-written material has become topic A in the periodical industry, because ChatGPT and similar programs known as chatbots have been shown to be capable of producing prose that mimics human writing to a surprising degree.""Everyone's talking about this, and a lot of people are focused on what this is going to mean for scientific publishing,"" says H. Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the Science family of journals. ""This whole craze has taken over the world, and everyone's in a frenzy.""Science has imposed the strictest policy on content generated by artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots among technical publishers: It's forbidden, period.The publications' ban includes ""text generated from AI, machine learning, or similar algorithmic tools"" as well as ""accompanying figures, images, or graphics."" AI programs cannot be listed as an author. Science warns that it will treat a violation of this policy as ""scientific misconduct.""Thorp further explained in an editorial that using programs such as ChatGPT would violate Science's fundamental tenet that its authors must certify that their submitted work is ""original."" That's ""enough to signal that text written by ChatGPT is not acceptable,"" he wrote: ""It is, after all, plagiarized from ChatGPT.""That goes further than the rules laid down by Nature, which sits at the summit of prestige scientific journals along with Science. The Nature journals specify that language-generating programs can't be credited as an author on a research paper, as has been tried on some published papers: ""Any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work,"" Nature explains, ""and AI tools cannot take such responsibility.""But Nature allows researchers to use such tools in preparing their papers, as long as they ""document this use in the methods or acknowledgements sections"" or elsewhere in the text.Thorp told me that Science chose to take a firmer stance to avoid repeating the difficulties that arose from the advent of Photoshop, which enables manipulation of images, in the 1990s.Plagiarized or chatbot-generated science fiction and fantasy submissions received by Neil Clarke's Clarkesworld magazine, by month. The huge runup in recent months is largely chatbot-written submissions, accounting for nearly 40% of total submissions in February. (Neil Clarke)""At the beginning, people did a lot of stuff with Photoshop on their images that we now think of as unacceptable,"" he says. ""When it first came along, we didn't have a lot of rules about that, but now people like to go back to old papers and say, 'Look what they did with Photoshop,' We don't want to repeat that.""The Science journals will wait until the scientific community coalesces around standards for the acceptable use of AI programs before reconsidering their rules, Thorp says: ""We're starting out with a pretty strict set of rules. It's a lot easier to loosen your guidelines later than to tighten them.""Underlying the concerns about ChatGPT and its AI cousins, however, are what may be exaggerated impressions about how good they really are at replicating human thought.What has been consistently overlooked, due in part to the power of hype, is how bad they are at intellectual processes that humans execute naturally and, generally, almost flawlessly.Credulous media narratives about the ""brilliance"" of ChatGPT focus on these successes ""without a serious look at the scope of the errors,"" observe computer scientists Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis.Helpfully, they've compiled a database of hundreds of sometimes risible flops by ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing and other language-generating programs: for example, their inability to perform simple arithmetic, to count to five, to understand the order of events in a narrative or to fathom that a person can have two parents — not to mention their tendency to fill gaps in their knowledge with fabrications.The heralds of AI assert that these shortcomings will eventually be solved, but when or even if that will happen is uncertain, given that the processes of human reasoning themselves are not well understood.The glorification of ChatGPT's supposed skills overlooks that the program and other chatbots essentially scrape the internet for existing content — blogs, social media, digitized old books, personal diatribes by ignoramuses and learned disquisitions by sages — and use algorithms to string together what they find in a way that mimics, but isn't, sentience.Human-generated content is their raw material, human designers ""train"" them where to find the content to respond to a query, human-written algorithms are their instruction set.The result resembles a conjuror's trick. The chatbots appear to be human because every line of output is a reflection of human input.The astonishment that humans experience at the apparent sentience of chatbots isn't a new phenomenon. It evokes what Joseph Weizenbaum, the inventor of Eliza, a 1960s-era natural language program that could replicate the responses of a psychotherapist to the plaints of a ""patient,"" noticed in the emotional reactions of users interacting with the program.“What I had not realized,"" he wrote later, ""is that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.”It's true that ChatGPT is good enough at mimicry to fool even educated professionals at first glance. According to a team of researchers at the University of Chicago and Northwestern, four professional medical reviewers were able to correctly pick out 68% of ChatGPT-generated abstracts of published scientific papers from a pile of 25 genuine and chat-generated abstracts. (They also incorrectly identified 14% of genuine abstracts as machine-written.)Nature reports that ""ChatGPT can write presentable student essays, summarize research papers, answer questions well enough to pass medical exams and generate helpful computer code.""But these are all fairly generic categories of writing, typically infused with rote language. ""AI is not creative, but iterative,"" says John Scalzi, the author of dozens of science fiction books and short stories who objected to the use by his publisher, Tor Books, of machine-generated art for the cover of a fellow author's latest novel.(Tor said in a published statement that it had not been aware that the cover art ""may have been created by AI,"" but said due to production schedules it had no choice but to move ahead with the cover once it learned about the source. The publishing house did say that it has ""championed creators in the SFF [that is, science fiction and fantasy] community since our founding and will continue to do so."")Of the prospect that machine-generated content will continue to improve, ""I think it's inevitable that it will reach a level of 'good enough,'"" Scalzi says. ""I don't think AI is going to create an enduring work of art akin to a 'Blood Meridian' or 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'"" he said, referring to novels by Cormac McCarthy and Terry McMillan, respectively.At this moment, the undisclosed or poorly disclosed use of chatbots has been treated as a professional offense almost comparable to plagiarism. Two deans at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of Education and Human Development have been suspended after the school issued an email in response to the Feb. 13 shootings at Michigan State University calling on the Vanderbilt community to ""come together"" in ""creating a safe and inclusive environment"" on campus.The email bore a small-print notice that it was a ""paraphrase"" from ChatGPT. The Michigan shooter killed three students and injured five.To be fair, Vanderbilt's ChatGPT email wasn't all that distinguishable from what humans on the university's staff might have produced themselves, an example of ""thoughts and prayers"" condolences following a public tragedy, which seem vacuous and robotic even when produced by creatures of flesh and blood.Chatbot products have yet to penetrate elite echelons of creative writing or art. Clarke says that what's driving the submission of machine-written stories to his magazine doesn't seem to be aspirations to creative achievement but the quest for a quick buck.""A lot are coming from 'side hustle' websites on the internet,"" he says. ""They're misguided by people hawking these moneymaking schemes.""Others fear that the ease of generating authentic-seeming but machine-generated prose and images will make the technology a tool for wrongdoing, much as cryptocurrencies have found their most reliable use cases in fraud and ransomware attacks.That's because these programs are not moral entities but instruments responsive to their users' impulses and reliant on the source material they're directed toward. Microsoft had to tweak its new ChatGPT-powered Bing search engine, for instance, when it responded weirdly, unnervingly, even insultingly to some users' queries.ChatGPT's output is theoretically constrained by ethical ""guardrails"" devised by its developers, but easily evaded — ""nothing more than lipstick on an amoral pig,"" Marcus has observed.""We now have the world’s most used chatbot,...glorified by the media, and yet with ethical guardrails that only sorta kinda work,"" he adds. ""There is little if any government regulation in place to do much about this. The possibilities are now endless for propaganda, troll farms, and rings of fake websites that degrade trust across the internet. It’s a disaster in the making.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Then ChatGPT happened.,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-spent-over-decade-bing-172600342.html,1677173160,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[Using AI, Microsoft might finally mount a challenge to Google’s dominance in search.Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled the new Bing search engine, which uses artificial intelligence to not just give users links, but also to provide answers to questions. Bing can respond, for example, to a query to create a spreadsheet of a company’s revenue for the past five years or to check if a certain-size futon will fit in a specified vehicle. Since Bing’s update, Google has come out with its own competitor, Bard.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly culture“We’ve been steadily focused on Bing and we’ve been working. We’ve been at it for the last two decades or so,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft, over a Microsoft Teams video chat last week.Part of the reason Bing never gained popularity was that by the time it launched in 2009, Google search, with a decade head start, had already become synonymous with searching the internet.But Microsoft would continue to work on re-vamping and re-branding Bing. Shortly after Bing rolled out, Microsoft struck a deal for Yahoo to be powered by Bing Search, boosting Bing’s growth in the market. In 2012, Microsoft announced a re-design of the search engine, which included Sidebar, a feature that searches users’ social networks for information relevant to the query.Microsoft incorporated Bing into other applications and devices such as its personal digital assistant Cortana, helping Bing turn its first quarterly profit of more than $1 billion in 2016. Three years later, Bing rolled out a feature allowing companies to create private, internal search results, positioning itself as a search engine for businesses.Still, Microsoft’s efforts have not done much to stop Bing from languishing in the global search industry. To date, Bing’s share of the market remains in the single digits, some estimates show. In the US, Bing carries about a quarter of the market.Story continuesMicrosoft re-imagines search engine with ChatGPTEvery two decades or so, technology makes a big pivot, Mehdi said, pointing to PCs, mobile phones, the cloud. Microsoft is betting that AI is the next opportunity to re-imagine search and the web browser.In 2019, Microsoft announced a partnership with OpenAI, the AI research company behind the chatbot ChatGPT and the visual illustration generator DALL-E. Both saw an opportunity to combine their AI efforts. Many of Microsoft’s technologies that weren’t designed for search proved helpful in developing the new Bing, Mehdi said, such as an AI supercomputer and the capability to host training data on the Azure cloud service.In the last year, he said the team started to see how ChatGPT applications could improve both core search and algorithmic ranking, as well as make a search interface more approachable. After ChatGPT launched, Mehdi said they “got even more conviction that this could be great in the context of search,” adding, “We’re going to learn a lot over the next year or two. It’s fun times.”Not surprisingly, problems abound with the new AI technology, with factual errors and the creepiness factor receiving a lot of splash in the media. “For anything that’s really important, you’ll always want to fact check,” Mehdi said. “You need to make the ultimate decision.” It’s a reminder that human judgment is still required in the age of AI.Microsoft rolled out Bing to a select cohort of users and aims to begin scaling it to millions of users in a few weeks. The company is using public feedback to improve the product.If the new Bing is successful, it could reshape Microsoft’s other offerings, such as the company’s support help desks or Outlook email platform. Imagine one person automatically creating a calendar invite with five employees in five different time zones. Just this week, Microsoft launched a new Bing chat experience with Skype.Rather than a grab for Google’s market share, “it’s more of a showcase for their shared services and and trying to make Microsoft cool again,” said Darin Stewart, a Gartner analyst.Could Microsoft snatch Google’s dominance in the search?While Google dwarfs the competition in search traffic, Microsoft’s Mehdi said, “We don’t have to necessarily change the entire search game to have success.” The US online advertising market is about $700 billion, and 42% of that is search, he said. Adding one point of search share translates to $2 billion of revenue for Microsoft, according to the company.Another advantage? Microsoft may have more to lose than Google does with this new bet. In the last quarter of 2022, Microsoft’s revenue from search and news advertising was $3.2 billion, just 6% of total revenue. Meanwhile, 56% of the total revenue for Alphabet, Google’s parent, came from search advertising in the same time period.But the question remains: Can Microsoft entice people to join Bing en masse? “I hope so. It certainly struck a chord with our launch,” said Mehdi. “And so, you know, it’s a start… and so we have to continue to do more innovation. But yes, I would say for the first time in a long time, we’re really excited about the opportunity to change the game of search for the better for people.”More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

But the judge withdrew the order on Wednesday citing unidentified ""errors.""The board has accused Starbucks of unlawful anti-union tactics at stores across the country during a wave of labor organizing. A nationwide order would have been a potent weapon for the agency to wield in its enforcement efforts.Court orders can help protect employees while the board litigates cases against their employers, and make it easier for the agency to go back to court to enforce the orders when they are violated.On Thursday, Goldsmith said the board ""has not demonstrated that Starbucks has implemented a corporate-wide anti-union policy.""Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The board's general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, said the order was disappointing but still provides critical protections to workers at the Ann Arbor store.""We will continue to seek nationwide relief ... to remedy violations of federal labor law by Starbucks and other entities, as appropriate,"" she said.Employees have voted to unionize about 280 Starbucks U.S. locations, while rejecting unions at more than 50 stores. Starbucks operates about 9,000 U.S. stores.The NLRB and Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing workers, have accused the company of firing pro-union employees, promising raises and benefits if workers do not unionize, and refusing to engage in contract talks at some locations. Starbucks has said it respects workers' rights to unionize.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and David Gregorio)]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure and equipment indicates an increase of 69.6% sequentially.Expanding customer base is expected to have driven revenues from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. The consensus mark for revenues from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure suggests a 68.8% surge from the previous quarter’s reported figure.Revenues from Power Purchase Agreements are expected to reflect a sequential increase on the back of new sites for existing customers and new customers accessing the PPA solution. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues from Power Purchase Agreements hints at a 37.6% rise from the sequential quarter’s reported number.An increase in the number of sites with fuel contracts is likely to have boosted revenues from fuel delivered to customers and related equipment.

Fortunately, we did not own shares until the end of Q2.

We remain favorable on the longterm fundamentals of the business and the opportunity for HCA to reinvest the large amounts of cash it generates at attractive returns. That said, the discount to our intrinsic value estimate has narrowed significantly following robust returns in the second half of the year.”6.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In the case of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the company is performing very well. Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks Favored by Carolina Panthers Owner David Tepper. Suggested articles:15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy11 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy12 Most Promising Solar Stocks According to AnalystsDisclosure.

The welcome rally of U.S. stocks that we have seen since the beginning of January to mid-February is fading out gradually.Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation. At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthen your portfolio.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers.

For more food companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Stocks. The food industry is one of the most crucial sectors in the world, and one that is also often thought of as a harbor against recession. The reasoning for this argues that during an economic downturn, while consumers will reduce their luxury spending, and put off buying an iPhone for example, they still have to buy food. Additionally, the food industry is also one of the largest in the world since it does not have to worry about creating demand and instead has to think of innovative ways to manage demand and out compete rivals in business processes such as logistics and supply chain management.Taking a look at the monetary estimates of the industry, a research report from Fortune Business Insights spells out the sheer scale of the sector. Zoning in on the food processing market, it points out that the sector was worth a whopping $2.3 trillion in 2021, and adds that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% to be worth an estimated $5.1 trillion by 2029.The sector's strength is evidenced by this CAGR, as trillion dollar industries generally do not have growth rates that end up exceeding 5%. The research firm outlines that the market growth will be supported by several trends, such as the growth in vegetarian diets, the surge in migration to cities, an increase in online ordering, and higher disposable incomes to spend on dining out.Today, we will take a look at some of the most profitable food companies in the world, and some of them are PepsiCo, Inc.

Additionally, its valuation is even more attractive, with its stock trading at just 0.2 times forward sales estimates.Kroger’s digital initiatives have been incredibly prosperous, with digital sales increasing 10% in its most recent quarter. This is especially impressive considering the stiff competition in the retail grocery space.

68,9920d6ab-8279-3cbc-a987-cbe059c316b8,ADM,2023-02-24,7 Stocks That Can Survive a Bumpy Ride to Low Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-survive-bumpy-ride-191503077.html,1676920503,STORY,['ADM'],"[Throughout 2022, investors quickly recognized that success for stocks to buy centered on entities that could ride out rising prices. Now, investors may need to strategize for the opposite scenario: the Federal Reserve continuing to hike benchmark interest rates to get inflation under control. Unfortunately, that might mean struggling through deflationary forces to get to low inflation.It just comes down to a math problem. In order for high inflation to come down to low inflation, some deceleration must occur, which would be relatively deflationary. By logical deduction, investors should consider stocks to buy that may perform decently well during cycles of declining prices.While no one knows what the Fed might do, the latest Consumer Price Index report came in slightly higher than expected. In addition, China’s economic reopening would translate to greater commercial activity, which is positive. However, it also means greater resource consumption, leading to higher prices. Therefore, it’s important to consider stocks to buy that may ride out the Fed’s hawkish strategy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$210.47DGDollar General$227.82ALLAllstate$135.05WTRGEssential Utilities$46.15SRESempra Energy$158.49ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.59PSXPhillips 66$99.54Stocks to Buy: Five Below (FIVE)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWith the Fed signaling that its top priority centers on controlling inflation, investors may want to target relatively upscale discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). Unlike literal dollar stores, Five Below carries prices up to its namesake price. As well, it features a select range of products that can go up to $25. Therefore, the company provides several compelling products that should appeal to a broader consumer base.Fundamentally, Five Below may buffet the storm of the higher rates necessary to bring inflation down to a low level. Basically, the classical definition of inflation is a circumstance where more dollars chase after fewer goods. With deflation, fewer dollars chase after more goods. But to get deflation, a central bank must usually crimp demand, which would hurt the labor market. Unfortunately, this dynamic suggests that consumers must make do with less. However, such a framework would likely benefit Five Below. Therefore, FIVE stands among the stocks to buy.Story continuesStocks to Buy: Dollar General (DG)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comUnder a similar philosophy to Five Below above, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) presents an effective name among stocks to buy. True, Dollar General might typically be an idea to mitigate the impact of ever-rising prices. However, the dollar store can also perform relatively well under deflationary forces. Again, such a condition implies a negative impact on the workforce, which means discount retailers will gain tremendous relevance.What I appreciate about DG as one of the stocks to buy ahead of the Fed’s potentially hawkish measures is its objective discount. According to Gurufocus.com’s DCF analysis, DG represents a modestly undervalued investment. Specifically, the investment resource calculates the fair value at $273.35. However, the market priced DG at $227.82 at the time of writing.Also, Dollar General benefits from excellent operational strengths. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.6%, outpacing 86.57% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 6.49%, beating out more than 87% of its peers. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $264.93, implying over 16% upside potential.Stocks to Buy: Allstate (ALL)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For the Fed’s efforts to contain inflation, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is an excellent candidate for stocks to buy. And that’s because whether we’re talking inflation, deflation, or some other kind of “flation” – including the dreaded stagflation – Allstate delivers. It has to be because the company benefits richly from a hostage audience.  For instance, almost every state in the Union requires auto drivers to carry at least liability insurance. Further, those rare jurisdictions that allow people to drive sans insurance must demonstrate proof of financial wherewithal. Basically, it’s just better to carry insurance, primarily because of the fear of the unknown.Plus, when the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, insurance pays. I mean, it can really save your hind end, even with a hefty deductible. In exchange for hundreds of dollars, you’ll spare yourself the pain of tens of thousands of dollars.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $142.31, implying over 5% growth. With a dividend yield of 2.52%, Allstate may be boring but it gets the job done.Essential Utilities (WTRG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAgainst a longer-term framework, arguably most people understand (and perhaps appreciate) what the Fed’s doing. If inflation continues to rise out of control, the economy may suffer substantial damage. However, getting to the point of low inflation is a major pain. To mitigate the possible incoming volatility, investors should consider Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) as one of the stocks to buy.A drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and service provider, Essential Utilities carries the underlying sector’s major advantage: a natural monopoly. Due to the extraordinarily high barrier to entry, few entities can compete with Essential. Cynically, this dynamic bodes very well for WTRG stock.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company enjoys excellent operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.7% of its peers. Also, its net margin pings at 22%, above nearly 88% of the sector. Lastly, Wall Street analysts love WTRG, pegging it a unanimous strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying over 15% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAs with Essential Utilities above, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) ranks among the stocks to buy because of its natural monopoly advantage. Despite Sempra’s customers complaining up a storm about its business practices over the years, no one can replace it. Nor can anyone provide an alternative: the barrier to entry simply rates well above most enterprises’ pay grade, particularly in California.Speaking of the Golden State, Sempra’s other advantages center on its geographic location. Covering much of Southern California, Sempra benefits from an economic powerhouse of the biggest engine of the U.S. While people complain about California and its high prices, the state continues to attract top-tier talent. Frankly, it’s too important of a region to ignore. Plus, when you’re dealing with such a lucrative market, the customers’ ability to pay becomes less of an issue. That’s something to keep in mind for stocks to buy as the Fed targets low inflation.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target of $172.50 implies nearly 9% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is one of the stocks to buy as the Fed attempts to spark low inflation. Because of the core necessity of the underlying sector, ADM can rise irrespective of fluctuating monetary cycles. After all, humans must eat, irrespective of what’s going on with the interest rate environment.Notably, ADM gained over 6% in the trailing year. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped more than 5% during the same period. Part of its resilience stems from its passive income. Presently, the company carries a forward yield of 2.21%. As well, the enterprise commands 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. That’s a status management won’t give up on without a major fight. Convincingly, Wall Street analysts peg ADM as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $104.20, implying upside potential of nearly 28%. Thus, ADM ranks among the top stocks to buy for the rough journey to low inflation.Phillips 66 (PSX)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the sector’s value chain. This involves refining and marketing. Fundamentally, Phillips 66 benefits from purchases of necessity. While the electric vehicle revolution may be occurring right now, the vast majority of people drive combustion-powered cars. Thus, PSX will stay relevant for quite some time.In the trailing year, Phillips 66 shares gained over 18% of equity value. Since the January opener, though, they slipped about 1.5%. However, this might be a buying opportunity as provides a compelling case from a passive income perspective. Right now, its forward yield stands at 4.22%. Moreover, it’s a stable yield thanks to its low payout ratio of 32.66%.Financially, PSX trades at a trailing multiple of 4.34. As a discount to earnings, the oil firm ranks better than 71.26% of the competition. In addition, it trades at 0.28 times sales. For this metric, Phillips 66 ranks better than 81.39% of sector peers. Thus, it’s a compelling example of stocks to buy for the low-inflation journey.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) has capitalized on the incredible rise of the semiconductor industry by playing a critical role in how these crucial components are manufactured. Synopsys specializes in developing electronic design automation (EDA) software used for designing and testing integrated circuits. The past does not predict the future, but the signs all seem to point to semiconductors contnuing to play a big role in society and technological evolution, and Synopsys has an important role in that growth.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with BBY. Click here to check it out. SNPS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SNPSPeter Lynch Chart of SNPSWhy is EDA software important? First, EDA tools are employed in the design and validation of semiconductor manufacturing processes, guaranteeing that they produce the necessary performance and density. Secondly, EDA tools are utilized to ensure that a design satisfies all the manufacturing process requirements. Deficiencies lead to a chip that either doesn't work or works at a lower capacity. Finally, after the chip is made, there is a need to track the performance of the device from testing after manufacturing to deployment in the field. The objective of this monitoring is to confirm that the device retains its expected level of performance throughout its lifespan and to prevent unauthorized tampering with the device.The total addressable market for EDA tools is expected to reach $22 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Synopsys gets roughly 65% of its revenue from EDA sales and has roughly a 30% market share according to TrendForce. This is why Synopsys has been able to crush it for more than a decade with top and bottom line growth.Synopsys - A Future-Focused Value StockSNPS Data by GuruFocusRock solid financialsSynopsys concluded its 2022 fiscal year (which ended on Oct. 31, 2022) with better than expected results and then started off this fiscal year with another earnings beat during the first quarter, despite a choppy microenvironment that saw reduced growth in the industry. For the full year of fiscal 2022, Synopsys saw revenue grow 18% to more than $5 billion, up from $3.1 billion in 2018 and $1.9 billion in 2013. The company now expects to earn between $10.50 and $10.60 per share in 2023. By 2030, I estimate earnings could reach $20 per share or higher, especially considering the company continues to buy back its stock.Story continuesMore importantly, the company's minimal debt level and $1.1 billion in cash means that the elevated interest rates in the market will have a negligible impact on its expenses and the company can continue to make strategic acquisitions. These have been a stable of growth for the company, and while it has racked up nearly $4 billion in goodwill on the books, that hasnt stopped Synopsys from also growing retained earnings at a healthy clip.In the last 10 years, retained earnings have grown from $1.3 billion to $5.8 billion, which has produced nearly $50 billion in market appreciation. In other words, the company has generated $10 in market price for every $1 retained.Huge advantage in AISynopsys' trademark product DSO.ai, the company's artificial intelligence design solution, has played a vital role in driving the current financial growth by substantially reducing turnaround time, compute resources and power consumption. Seven of the top 10 semiconductor companies have utilized DSO.ai for production design, saving R&amp;D resources for the customers and helping Synopsys double its customer count in the last 12 months.Synopsys is also in favorable position to withstand (perhaps even take advantage of) a possible economic downturn. In particular, technology spending tends to be resilient in the face of economic challenges with companies understandably cautious about cutting expenses that are crucial for future growth. Additionally, the CHIPS and Science Act signed into law in August should boost earnings by providing funding for its R&amp;D initiatives. The act provides roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States, which Synopsys is sure to get a sizable chunk.Mr. Market is fickleSynopsys will likely not be the growth story it was in the last decade going forward. It doesnt need to be. With this level of profitability and the need for products in the semiconductor market at stable high marks, it should continue to build retained earnings and book value at a similar rate going forward. Synopsys should continue to benefit from both the rising complexity of chip designs and the accelerated trends toward artificial intelligence, 5G communications, autonomous vehicles and cloud computing.If the market continues to reward that growth with a 10 to 1 capitalization increase, by 2030 the market value could reach north of $160 billion. On the other hand, whats more likely to happen is that despite the growth and profitability, the market will reduce its reward ratio to 5:1 or even 2:1, meaning even if Synopsys books an additional $11 billion in retained earnings by 2030, that will only be worth another $22 billion to $55 billion in market cap - still a signficant addition to the current market value of $55 billion.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Even better, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates IGT could significantly beat bottom-line expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q4 EPS at $0.40. On the top line, fourth-quarter sales are expected to be $1.04 billion, down roughly -1% from the prior year quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRounding out fiscal year 2022, IGT’s earnings are now forecasted to climb 609% to $2.20 a share compared to EPS of $0.31 in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to drop -20% to $1.74 per share after a stellar year. Sales are expected to be up 2% for FY22 and slightly dip -1% in FY23 to $4.15 billion.TakeawayWith shares of IGT up 15% year to date, the impressive rally could continue if the company can reach quarterly expectorations and offer positive guidance. Further supporting more upside is IGT’s valuation at $26 a share and 14.9X forward earnings which is nicely below the industry average of 20.3X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.2X.Story continuesMonster Beverage (MNST) Out of the Consumer Staples sector, Monster Beverage stock is intriguing before its fourth-quarter report on February 28.

The beverage company is anticipated to have witnessed revenue and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.59 billion, indicating growth of 11.5% from that reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for earnings of 61 cents per share suggests growth of 1.7% from 60 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.For 2022, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.28, suggesting a decline of 11.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $6.4 billion, suggesting 15.3% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 3.5%. It has delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.5%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMonster Beverage Corporation price-eps-surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteMonster Beverage has been gaining from the continued momentum in the energy drinks category, as well as product innovation plans. It has been on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. These are likely to have boosted top and bottom-line performances in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management was optimistic about strength in the global energy drinks category. The company has been poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands, and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands. Gains from these segments are likely to get reflected in the company’s top line for the fourth quarter.Monster Beverage has been committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. The company has been introducing many products and expanding distribution in international markets, which have been aiding its performance.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, MNST stated that it intended to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022. Also, it expected to launch a number of products and product lines in the domestic and international markets in the last quarter of 2022. This is expected to have aided revenues in the fourth quarter.MNST has been making efforts to overcome supply-chain challenges. Some of the notable actions taken to navigate through the challenges are decreasing its reliance on imported cans. The company has been purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in the United States and EMEA. MNST also rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long-distance freight to meet consumer demand. It is returning to its orbit strategy of producing closer to customers. This is expected to have cushioned the bottom line through improved margins.Monster Beverage has been implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. The company has been on track with the mitigation of higher production and distribution costs through pricing actions and lowered promotional expenses. It implemented price increases for its products in the United States on Sep 1, 2022. It also brought effective price increases in certain international markets in the third quarter. Continued pricing actions are expected to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage has been witnessing inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans, shipping, freight and other inputs. Elevated ingredients and other import costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, are likely to have been concerning. These are expected to have dented the company’s margins to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s bottom line is expected to have been impacted by the global supply-chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion. This, in turn, is likely to have led to shortages of certain ingredients and finished products. Also, the company has been reeling under a significant rise in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Monster Beverage this time around.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Southwest Airlines (LUV) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Southwest currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for LUVBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for LUVCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Southwest here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Southwest, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is LUV a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Southwest, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 12.1% over the past month to $2.74.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Southwest. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Southwest with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

78,ba86bf82-9fe9-3230-b81f-db68e494303e,PM,2023-02-24,Value vs. Growth: 3 Stocks Investors Should Buy for Each Style,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-vs-growth-3-stocks-214509347.html,1677188709,STORY,"['ABNB', 'PM']","[The battle between value and growth stocks is a very interesting, long-term cyclical one. A spread chart comparing returns from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq index can be useful for visualizing the relationship long-term, and more recently. Trending higher, the market favors value, and trending lower favors growth.The chart shows that the lowest point in the spread happened during the peak of the Technology Bubble in 2000, after which the market rigorously bid up value stocks. Post 2002, growth slowly but surely, lead for nearly two decades. But then in late 2021, we got very near that extreme low of 2000, and value stocks have again begun to trend higher.TradingVIewImage Source: TradingVIewIn a more zoomed in view of the chart we can see that the spread has broken out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern over the last few months, favoring value. It has since pulled back though, making it a bit unclear on the next direction. If it trades lower, into the consolidation, that may signal growth stocks are back in favor, but if it turns higher, value should find support.This is significant because growth stocks have led the market higher so far in 2023. So, we will find out soon if growth back in favor is for real, or just a bear market rally.TradingVIewImage Source: TradingVIewI truly don’t know which will be the favorite this year based on the chart. I tend to favor value, but you never know. One way to play the uncertainty is to buy a bit of both, and focus on the leaders of each respective investing style. Then when the spread begins to favor value or growth more clearly, you can lean heavier into the leaders, and cut some of the laggards.Value StocksIn the case of another challenging year stocks, like 2022, value is going to be more defensive, and outperform the market. Additionally, many of these companies provide dividend payments, making it easier to weather market drawdowns.One classic example of a value stock is Procter and Gamble PG. As a producer of consumer staples such as soap and laundry detergent PG isn’t riding the cutting edge of technology. But it is making money consistently and growing steadily. The stock also holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating a positive trend in earnings revisions.Story continuesAlthough Procter and Gamble stock is on the expensive side, currently trading at 24x one-year forward earnings, above its ten-year median of 22x, sometimes you must pay up for quality.Making it easier to hold through the tough times is a dividend yield of 2.6%. And PG has raised its dividend every year for 66 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother stock worth considering is Philip Morris International PM. The tobacco business is currently undergoing a transformation to a combustion free product line and doing so with success.Philip Morris currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a reasonable valuation. PM is trading at 15.7x one-year forward earnings, below its ten-year median of 16.6x, and below the broad market average.Furthermore, Philip Morris stock offers a 5.1% dividend yield, which has been raised every year since 2008.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s MCD is another great value stock. Over the last 20 years it has had some of the smoothest returns and dramatically outperformed the broad market. Compounding at nearly 19% annually the stock has returned 5x that of the S&amp;P 500.MCD is also a dividend aristocrat stock, having raised dividends consecutively for 46 years. McDonald’s stock currently has a 2.3% dividend yield. Trading at 25x one-year forward P/E it is just above its 10-year median of 23x, and well off its recent high of 39x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth Growth stocks are going to do well if inflation can continue to cool, and the Federal Reserve can finish with their rate raising policy. Growth stocks earn high multiples because of their tremendous growth rates, but because interest rates are an important factor in valuing stocks, rising rates have crushed growth valuations. But if the peak in rates is in sight, maybe growth stocks have found the lows.Because many participants think we are near a peak in interest rates, they have been bidding up growth stocks all year. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation fund ARKK, which invests in disruptive growth stocks has crushed the returns of the S&amp;P 500 ETF SPY year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne growth stock that has rallied massively this year is Airbnb ABNB. While ABNB is a growth stock, it is also a company that I deem much less speculative than some others. Airbnb has a proven product, and has been around for 15 years, so it’s not something I would expect to go belly up, even if the stock declines. ABNB also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating strong earnings revisions higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdmittedly, ABNB has a very rich valuation, currently trading at 38x one-year forward earnings. It is below its one-year median of 51x, and way off its high of 120x, but the stock has not been trading for very long, and went public during a massive bull market.Airbnb is continuing to grow like crazy though, so maybe the valuation isn’t so ridiculous. Since 2020 ABNB has grown sales from $3.4 billion, to $8.4 billion today. But don’t expect any dividend payments from ABNB though.Another growth stock that I really consider to be a nice blend of value and growth is Visa V. As a product hundreds of millions of people use multiple times per day, Visa is not speculative in any way, and it also has rather high sales growth. In V, you get both the security of a value stock, and the high expected returns of a growth stock.  Visa has been a very strong performing stock since its IPO in 2008. V has compounded at nearly 20% annually since then and returned more than 4x that of the broad market. A bit concerning is that Visa’s strong returns line up very succinctly with the dominance of the growth factor, so although V is a great company, I am sure that the broad growth theme helped boost the stock’s returns.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating a positive trend in earning revisions.Visa’s valuation is also right in line with its long-term historical median. Currently trading at 24x one-year forward earnings, it is right in line with its median of 24x, and well off the recent high of 38x.ServiceNow NOW is another growth stock that has experienced very strong price appreciation. Over the last 10 years NOW stock has compounded 30% annually, giving IPO investors a 12x return on their investments.ServiceNow is an enterprise cloud computing business that builds workflows for a litany of high-tech businesses including software and IT, as well as robotics and AI applications. NOW is a platform-as-a-service business that provides technical support for its customers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNOW is like a prototypical growth stock with parabolic looking sales graphs, and a premium valuation to match. ServiceNow is one of these technology stocks that prefer to be valued based on Price to Sales, rather than Price to Earnings. With a P/E ratio of 150x and a P/S of 10x, there is no way around the fact that it is a pricey stock. Worth noting that sales have gone from $188 million in 2011 to $7.3 billion today, which is kind of mind-boggling.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile we don’t know who is going to be the winner this year between value and growth, we do know that great stocks, with growing earnings are going to appreciate. Focusing on building a diversified portfolio with both value and growth stocks is a safe way to build wealth. Furthermore, using the Zacks Rank will help identify stocks that are expected to go up in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Dividend Stocks Favored by Carolina Panthers Owner David Tepper. Suggested articles:15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy11 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy12 Most Promising Solar Stocks According to AnalystsDisclosure.

The company did not identify the other bodies.Goldman also approved a $30-billion stock buyback program in February, it disclosed in the filing.The disclosure comes ahead of a crucial investor day, where Chief Executive David Solomon is expected to present plans to reach key financial goals after some missteps that led Goldman to temper ambitions for its consumer banking unit Marcus.Investment banks are hoping for a rebound in dealmaking in the second half of 2023 as the Federal Reserve eases off its rate-hike cycle, after a tough year when financing dried up and companies postponed plans for mergers and acquisitions.Last month, Goldman said it was cutting around 3,200 jobs, which comprised 6% of its workforce in an attempt to cut costs.Goldman's shares were down nearly 0.5% in premarket trading on Friday, in line with other major U.S. banks. They had gained nearly 11% in the past year. (Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru and Saeed Azhar in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Shounak Dasgupta)]"

That compares with 24.3% in 2021, a blockbuster year, reflecting how volatile Goldman's earnings can be.The company needs to provide a ""credible plan"" to reach the medium-term target of 15% to 17%, Cronin said.Solomon's performance will also be scrutinized. The consumer business that he championed lost $3 billion in almost three years and its operations are being probed by regulators. Marcus's woes also weighed on fourth-quarter earnings, which fell dramatically short of analyst expectations.The results prompted investors and analysts to ask what comes next.""We've set a clear strategic direction and we're looking forward to sharing more on our plans to continue to deliver for shareholders at investor day,"" said Tony Fratto, a company spokesman.Solomon typically serves as Goldman's statesman, addressing conferences, speaking to media and posting a steady stream of photos to his LinkedIn page. But ahead of the Feb. 28 gathering, members of Goldman's top brass have joined in, granting rare press interviews to tout the company's performance. It's a big shift for a bank that has traditionally shunned attention.Story continuesIn 2020, Solomon kicked off Goldman's inaugural investor day by telling participants they should feel free to ""break into open applause.""The tone may be more somber this year after the company laid off about 3,200 employees. The CEO's pay was reduced 29% to $25 million for 2022 amid a challenging operating environment.Goldman's stock has outperformed most top U.S. banks since Solomon took the helm in 2018, but trailed rival Morgan Stanley. Goldman shares edged 0.5% lower in pre-market trading on Friday, in line with peers.Its board approved a share buyback of up to $30 billion, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.Goldman trades at a price-to-book ratio, which measures the value of a company's stock, of 1.19, less than Morgan Stanley's 1.78 and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's 1.39.The bank will probably miss its return target this year and next, said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Its headcount and compensation expenses should be reduced, given the worsening economic outlook and sluggish dealmaking, he said. Losses from the consumer business will also be a drag on earnings.COST CUTSGoldman will probably need to make deeper cost cuts ""given the ongoing uncertain revenue environment,"" Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note.The company needs to articulate a clearer path to profits for the newly-formed Platform Solutions unit, Fannon wrote. The division, which houses transaction banking, credit card and fintech operations, lost $1.67 billion in 2022.David Fanger, analyst at Moody's Investors Service, wants more details on Goldman's move to slim down alternative investments that weighed on earnings.Some analysts have suggested Goldman Sachs should make a large acquisition in wealth management. That has been a winning strategy for rival Morgan Stanley, which benefited from more diverse revenue sources after buying brokerages Smith Barney and E*TRADE.A deal could broaden Goldman's revenue beyond trading and investment banking, which can be buffeted by economic cycles. The two divisions, which were merged last year, comprised 69% of the firm's revenue in 2022.Solomon has pushed back on deal talk, telling investors that there is a high bar for big transactions.""This is certainly what the equity market wants them to do, but from a credit standpoint, it could be quite risky,"" because it is easier to build a business in-house, said Fanger at Moody's.The investor day is also an opportunity for the company to address questions around Solomon's leadership after bad press, Mayo said.Veteran bankers at Goldman often cite their long tenures as marks of confidence and continuity. But several presenters from the 2020 investor day have since left.Among them are former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr, who left to become the CEO of Hertz last year, and Gregg Lemkau, the previous co-head of investment banking who now manages the assets of Dell founder, Michael Dell, at MSD Capital. Veteran partner Tim O'Neill retired as a partner.Marcus has also had a wave of departures. Swati Bhatia, who led the direct-to-consumer unit, stepped down last month. Two former heads of the business -- Omer Ismail and Harit Talwar -- also moved on in recent years.Solomon, however, is planning to stay.Addressing investors as a Florida conference this month, he said: ""I am delighted to be here, and I promise you, I am delighted to come back to Florida in February next year too.""(Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Additional reporting by Niket Nishant; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Nick Zieminski)]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Schlumberger's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:19% = US$3.5b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo start with, Schlumberger's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 9.3% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Schlumberger's moderate 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.When you consider the fact that the industry earnings have shrunk at a rate of 4.3% in the same period, the company's net income growth is pretty remarkable.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SLB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Schlumberger Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Schlumberger has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 27% (or a retention ratio of 73%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Schlumberger has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 26%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Schlumberger's future ROE will be 23% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Schlumberger's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

For more oil stocks, head on over to 5 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The oil and gas industry is one of the most important and lucrative sectors in the world. This is simply due to the nature of the product itself, with the marvels of internal combustion ensuring that whether it's transportation or power generation, some of the most crucial sectors of the global economy remain dependent on fossil fuels.Naturally, this criticality within the global economy also lends the industry some high valuations. For instance, a research report from Maximize Market Research outlines that the global crude oil market was worth $1.3 trillion in 2021 and from then until 2029 it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% to be worth an estimated $1.6 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that growth in the global population along with developments in the petrochemical and agricultural sectors will drive the industry forward. It adds that both Asia and North America will outpace the broader industry in terms of growth since the pair will each exhibit a 1.9% CAGR.Right now, the crude oil industry is battling to figure out what impact a Chinese economic recovery will have on the industry. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that while oil prices will increase to $100 per barrel, this will only happen in December this year due to higher supplies from the U.S. and Russia, longer winters, and a Chinese reopening.

The dynamic nature of the healthcare crisis over the past two and a half years has further altered the industry landscape, putting robotic and remote medical services in the limelight.Despite the reopening of the economy, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, industry watchers are still unable to gauge the magnitude of economic revival due to the emergence of new COVID strains in selective parts of the world from time to time.The just-reported fourth-quarter result of a number of medical instrument companies confirmed a gradual rebound in their base businesses through the latter half of 2022. However, the industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Edwards Lifesciences, IDEXX Laboratories and Hologic, Inc. have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&amp;D) in therapeutic areas.

Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&amp;D.Story continuesAmong the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments IndustryBusiness Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macro-economic situation, the IMF came up with its January 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. The update noted that global growth might slightly slow down from 3.4% in 2022, to 2.9% in 2023, then again rebound to 3.1% in 2024. IMF specifically addressed the ongoing tightening financial conditions in most regions, staffing shortages,Russia’s continued aggression, all of which have been weighing heavily on the medical instrument outlook despite the decline in COVID-19 severity. Per IMF, through 2023, inflation could remain stubbornly high, with continued labor market tightness and growing wage pressures requiring tighter monetary policies. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand.Overall, the Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.M&amp;A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) trend. In fact, various reports suggest that M&amp;A has been the key catalyst in the U.S. MedTech space of late. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation.The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. Among the significant deals of recent times, in December 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson completed the $16.6-billion mammoth acquisition of Abiomed. In February 2023, Abbott announced its plans to acquire Cardiovascular Systems, a medical device company with advanced atherectomy system used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease. The same month, Globus Medical announced its plans to acquire the San-Diego based spine technology firm, NuVasive Inc., in an all-stock deal valued at around $3.1 billion.Meanwhile, a MedTech Dive report of January 2023 revealed that MedTech players are expected to demonstrate a slow start to 2023 in terms on M&amp;A. Yet, the experts say that despite higher interest rates and a volatile stock market, there are signs that strategic M&amp;As are poised to rebound.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%.Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Good ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.The fourth-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $2.93 billion.Management noted that the top line was aided by non-recurring favorable adjustments in the third quarter. However, the quarterly revenues were negatively impacted by increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues, favorable changes in government rates driven by the administration of influenza vaccines, favorable changes in the commercial mix and the continued migration to Medicare Advantage plans.Full-year revenues were $11.61 billion, reflecting a 0.1% dip from the comparable 2021 period. Our projection of full-year revenues was $11.63 billion.Segment DetailsThe company’s dialysis patient service revenues were $2.80 billion, down by 1.4% year over year. Other revenues were $113.3 million, up 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.This figure compares to our dialysis patient service revenues and Other revenues fourth-quarter projection of $2.83 billion and $106.2 million, respectively.Per management, the total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter were 7,239,660 or 91,641 per day, on average.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $6.46.Our TakeDaVita ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with lower-than-expected revenues. The dismal overall top-line and bottom-line results are disappointing. A fall in the company’s dialysis patient service revenues and total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter is concerning. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well for the company. The company faced negative volume trends and continued labor pressure during the reported quarter, which is further concerning.However, DaVita’s better-than-expected earnings are encouraging. The uptick in the company’s Other revenues during the period is impressive. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and the opening of others within the United States and overseas is also encouraging.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.82.Our TakeMerit Medical exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines is impressive. The company saw revenue growth in its Cardiovascular segment and across the majority of its product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside are impressive. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends pushed up the overall top line, which is encouraging.The company stands to benefit from the execution of its global growth and profitability plan. A robust product line raises investors’ optimism about the stock. This month, Merit Medical announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Device Designation for the SCOUT MD Surgical Guidance System. In November 2022, the company announced the U.S. commercial release of the basixALPHA Inflation Device and the U.S. commercial release of the PreludeSYNC EZ Radial Compression Device. These also look promising for the stock.However, a decline in the CPS and Endoscopy revenues during the reported quarter is concerning. Rising product costs putting pressure on Merit Medical’s margin, thereby leading to a contraction of both margins, does not look encouraging. The current challenging global macro environment raises our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksMerit Medical currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

102,c60174f6-9fe5-3008-ab93-6911a2c1ed38,HOLX,2023-02-24,3 Medical Instruments Stocks to Buy Amid Improving Industry Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-medical-instruments-stocks-buy-152703774.html,1677166023,STORY,['HOLX'],"[The Medical Instruments industry has witnessed a significant transformation in the nature of business lately, leading to increased investment in R&amp;D for the development of cutting-edge technologies. The dynamic nature of the healthcare crisis over the past two and a half years has further altered the industry landscape, putting robotic and remote medical services in the limelight. Despite the reopening of the economy, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, industry watchers are still unable to gauge the magnitude of economic revival due to the emergence of new COVID strains in selective parts of the world from time to time.The just-reported fourth-quarter result of a number of medical instrument companies confirmed a gradual rebound in their base businesses through the latter half of 2022. However, the industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Edwards Lifesciences EW, IDEXX Laboratories IDXX and Hologic, Inc. HOLX have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&amp;D) in therapeutic areas. This FDA-regulated industry comprises an endless number of products, starting from transcatheter valves to orthopedic products to imaging equipment and robotics. Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&amp;D. Among the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments IndustryBusiness Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macro-economic situation, the IMF came up with its January 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. The update noted that global growth might slightly slow down from 3.4% in 2022, to 2.9% in 2023, then again rebound to 3.1% in 2024. IMF specifically addressed the ongoing tightening financial conditions in most regions, staffing shortages, Russia’s continued aggression, all of which have been weighing heavily on the medical instrument outlook despite the decline in COVID-19 severity. Per IMF, through 2023, inflation could remain stubbornly high, with continued labor market tightness and growing wage pressures requiring tighter monetary policies. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand. Overall, the Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.M&amp;A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) trend. In fact, various reports suggest that M&amp;A has been the key catalyst in the U.S. MedTech space of late. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation. The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. Among the significant deals of recent times, in December 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson completed the $16.6-billion mammoth acquisition of Abiomed. In February 2023, Abbott announced its plans to acquire Cardiovascular Systems, a medical device company with advanced atherectomy system used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease. The same month, Globus Medical announced its plans to acquire the San-Diego based spine technology firm, NuVasive Inc., in an all-stock deal valued at around $3.1 billion.Meanwhile, a MedTech Dive report of January 2023 revealed that MedTech players are expected to demonstrate a slow start to 2023 in terms on M&amp;A. Yet, the experts say that despite higher interest rates and a volatile stock market, there are signs that strategic M&amp;As are poised to rebound.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%. Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Good ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The industry, housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #85, which places it in the top 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The company expects net sales between $290 million and $295 million.Story continuesOur TakeGlaukos exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with decent results, wherein revenues and earnings beat estimates.It launched iPrime — a new disco elastic delivery device — in the latter part of the second quarter of 2022. The company had also launched the iAccess device for go anatomy procedures in the same time period. The addition of these new devices will provide unique and improved treatment solutions for surgeons, customers and patients. The company’s iAccess device received positive market feedback.In August 2022, Glaukos announced that it had received the FDA 510(K) clearance for iStent infinite — the first FDA-cleared micro-invasive implantable device used as a standalone treatment option for glaucoma patients to reduce elevated intraocular pressure. The potential launch of the product, expected later this year, will likely accelerate Glaucoma net sales growth going forward. The company also has several other treatment options in its pipeline. These developments raise our optimism about the stock.However, wider adjusted loss per share and lower overall revenues on a year-over-year basis are disappointing. Glaukos incurred an operating loss in the reported quarter, raising our apprehension.

Within the segment, Instruments sales grew by 2.2% at the Constant Exchange Rate.The organic revenue growth of 1.7% in Neurosurgery was driven by strong growth in CUSA capital and disposables in the United States and global small capital sales, offset by the recall impact of CereLink monitors.Story continuesThe Tissue Technologies segment (34% of the revenues), reported revenues of $133.4 million in the fourth quarter, down 1.1% year over year on a reported basis and up 5% on an organic basis. The organic growth was mainly due to sales in Wound Reconstruction and Care, with strength from Integra Skin, amniotics, Primatrix, MicroMatrix and Cytal, partially offset by a decline in the private label.MarginsThe gross profit in the reported quarter totaled $250.1 million, up 0.3% year over year.

The transactions are expected to be completed in the first half of 2023.GuidanceThe company provided its financial guidance for 2023. The guidance takes into account the recovery of markets prior to pandemic levels and the impact of Integra’s commercial capability build-out and new products.For the full year, IART projects revenues in the band of $1.60-$1.62 billion. This suggests reported growth of approximately 2.9%-4% and organic growth of 4%-5.2%.The sequential improvement from first to second-half growth is primarily driven by the gradual recovery of supply throughout the year, the normalization of private label orders from 2022, the recovery of China’s business post-pandemic lockdowns, and the timing of the CereLink relaunch.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.61 billion.The company expects to deliver adjusted earnings per diluted share in the band of $3.43-$3.51, considering the impact of the share repurchase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.51.Integra’s guidance for the first quarter of 2023 takes into account the timing of the CereLink relaunch and the recent acquisition of Surgical Innovation Associates and the divestiture of the TWC business.For the first quarter, Integra expects revenues in the range of $370-$376 million, which suggests growth of approximately -1.5% to flat and organic growth of 2-3.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $379.6 million.The adjusted EPS is estimated in the range of 72-76 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 78 cents.Our TakeIntegra exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with an earnings beat and a year-over-year decline in revenues. The decrease was mainly due to a significant FX headwind and the impact of the TWC divestiture.On a positive note, consistent demand recovery in markets across various segments and key product lines at near pre-pandemic levels fuelled by the gradual improvement of the supply chain, buoys optimism. The relaunch of Cerelink at the end of the second quarter of 2023 is also a positive.Within the Tissue Technologies segment, the increased capacity and productivity from the integration of the ACell portfolio delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Expansion in both margins is also impressive.With plans for international expansion in the pipeline, an improvement in the gross margin through a favorable product mix and a focus on price capture and increased efficiencies within the company’s manufacturing sites, Integra expects accelerated growth in 2023 and strengthened margin accretion.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIntegra currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

""There are a variety of budgeting resources available, including budget worksheets to help prioritize expenses.""Story continuesIf you see that you are spending too much on streaming services, you may want to cancel to prioritize spending on other forms of entertainment.pixinoo / Shutterstock.comThe Service Isn't a Fit for Your NeedsNot every person needs every streaming service. Consider if your Netflix subscription is truly benefiting you.""Do your research,"" said Rebecca Gramuglia, consumer expert at TopCashback.com. ""Streaming services are not always 'one size fits all.' Look into services that fit your needs and provide multiple benefits to your lifestyle. For example, if you shop online often and like to get things delivered quickly -- but you also like streaming video content -- Amazon Prime might be the fit for you.""martin-dm / Getty Images/iStockphotoYou Could Get the Service for Free""Check your wireless plan perks,"" said money-saving expert Andrea Woroch. ""Some wireless carriers offer free subscription services through your plan, so you could be paying unnecessarily for a service that is offered to you already for free. For example, T-Mobile users can get free Netflix, a year of Apple TV and Paramount+, and Sprint offers their members free Hulu and Tidal.""Marvin Samuel Tolentino Pineda / Getty ImagesYou've Watched All the Content You Are Interested in AlreadyHow many times have you opened up Netflix app only to find that there's nothing you actually want to watch? To avoid this, Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com, recommends putting your subscriptions on a rotation.""Even if you have a preferred streaming service, odds are good that there are times when you can't find anything to watch on them,"" she said. ""And if there are particular shows you want to watch, you may have to wait for new seasons or episodes to be released, so try to cancel or pause the services when you can. For instance, if you're waiting for season four of ""You"" on Netflix, you can cancel the service until the season drops. The same goes with other services; by pausing or canceling ones you aren't interested in at the moment, you can cut back on your overall expenses related to streaming.""Mano Kors / Shutterstock.comYou're Paying More Than You Need ToIn some cases, you may not want to cancel a subscription entirely. If you're spending too much on streaming services, consider downgrading a subscription plan or two.""Basic plans for streaming services can be almost half the price, ""Gramuglia said. The difference between Netflix's premium subscription and basic subscription with ads is even bigger than that though, dropping from $19.99 to only $6.99 per month.More From GOBankingRatesFood Stamps: What Is the Maximum SNAP EBT Benefit for 2023?Do You Have a Tax Question?

106,e984d3b8-ba4b-3da7-bdc4-d7ed52629fc6,NFLX,2023-02-24,Exclusive-Netflix making preparations to open Vietnam office - sources,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-netflix-making-preparations-open-070626379.html,1677222386,STORY,['NFLX'],"[By Fanny Potkin and Phuong NguyenSINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S streaming giant Netflix Inc is making preparations to open an office in Vietnam after years of negotiations with authorities and completing a risk assessment, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.A local office would make Netflix the first major U.S tech firm with a direct presence in the fast-growing Southeast Asian country of 100 million, increasingly seen as too lucrative to ignore despite wariness over its stringent internet rules.Netflix declined to comment in response to Reuters questions about its plans and its current operations in Vietnam.The company is in the early stage of planning for a local entity in Vietnam after completing an assessment in late 2022 that evaluated security and political risks of operating an office in Vietnam and the handling of user data and sensitive content, the sources said.The people declined to be identified because the preparations are confidential.The office could open as early as late 2023 but will require a lengthy regulatory process that could take longer, according to one of the sources.Authorities announced a new decree, effective from January, requiring video-on-demand service providers to seek licences from the Vietnamese government to operate, which would in turn require establishing a local office, although details of implementation remain unclear.Vietnam has proven complex for tech firms to navigate, due in part to a lack of clarity on specific requirements and enforcement mechanisms for its often strict regulations, foreign executives familiar with operations in the country have said.Although Vietnam's cybersecurity law of 2018 requires all foreign businesses earning income from online activities in Vietnam to open a local office, only TikTok owner ByteDance has so far complied, even though several other social media providers count Vietnam as one of their top-10 global markets.As Vietnamese officials grow more confident in the country's rising consumer power, however, they have begun ramping up pressure on tech firms to abide by the rules.Story continuesThey threatened to shut down Facebook in 2020 over political content on the platform, and in 2022 introduced new regulations requiring that tech firms store user data locally and that social media firms remove within 24 hours what the authorities deem to be false content.NETFLIX MEETINGNetflix told senior Vietnamese government officials it was studying the possibility of opening a local representative office during a December 2022 meeting with the firm's Asia business strategy vice president, according to a statement posted on the Ministry of Planning and Investment's website.Nguyen Van Doan, a senior official at the ministry, ""expressed his wish that Netflix soon establish a legal entity in Vietnam and contribute to the development of the Vietnamese economy,"" the statement said.Vietnam's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment.With the fastest growing middle class in Southeast Asia, Vietnam has become a key market for tech giants.Its digital economy including fintech, e-commerce and online entertainment is on track to grow to nearly $50 billion in total transactions per year by 2025, more than double last year's figure, according to a report by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain &amp; Company.Vietnam's ruling Communist Party maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent, with strict rules over online content, while the government is keeping increasingly close tabs on foreign players in the sector.The authorities announced last month that they had collected 1.8 trillion dong ($78 million) in taxes from Google, Meta, Netflix and TikTok in 2022.The Vietnamese government had for years been demanding tax payments by tech giants, including Netflix, that were operating without local offices, according to sources familiar with the matter.Companies had said they lacked a proper mechanism to pay tax in Vietnam, although this was addressed last year with the creation of an online portal for that purpose.Social media companies have faced particular pressure over content, including pending rules over the posting of news-related content on social media accounts, although Netflix has also on occasion been the target of public orders by the government to block domestic access to content judged ""offensive to the Vietnamese people"".This included in 2022 the Hollywood film ""Uncharted"", which referenced Chinese claims in the South China Sea, and the South Korean drama ""Little Women"", which contained scenes of the Vietnam War.(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Phuong Nguyen in Hanoi; Editing by Edmund Klamann)]"

The past year has seen intense competition in the streaming industry as a pandemic-driven boom fades and consumers curtail spending over fears of a possible recession, forcing companies to rethink their strategies.According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, the price cuts took place in some countries in the Middle East, sub-Saharan African, Latin America and Asia.The cuts apply to certain tiers of Netflix in those markets - in some cases, the cost of a subscription was halved, the Journal reported.Netflix, which operates in over 190 countries, has been looking to grow its share in newer international regions as the U.S. and Canada markets saturate. Earlier this month, it laid out plans to crack down on password sharing for accounts on its streaming platform.The company added about 7.6 million subscribers in the fourth quarter after bleeding subscribers in the first half of 2022 as rivals such as Paramount+ and Disney+ raked in subscribers.But average revenue per membership declined across regions in the last three months of 2022.""We're always exploring ways to improve our members' experience.

113,9920d6ab-8279-3cbc-a987-cbe059c316b8,PSX,2023-02-24,7 Stocks That Can Survive a Bumpy Ride to Low Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-survive-bumpy-ride-191503077.html,1676920503,STORY,"['DG', 'ALL-PG', 'ADM', 'FIVE', 'SRE', 'PSX', 'WTRG']","[Throughout 2022, investors quickly recognized that success for stocks to buy centered on entities that could ride out rising prices. Now, investors may need to strategize for the opposite scenario: the Federal Reserve continuing to hike benchmark interest rates to get inflation under control. Unfortunately, that might mean struggling through deflationary forces to get to low inflation.It just comes down to a math problem. In order for high inflation to come down to low inflation, some deceleration must occur, which would be relatively deflationary. By logical deduction, investors should consider stocks to buy that may perform decently well during cycles of declining prices.While no one knows what the Fed might do, the latest Consumer Price Index report came in slightly higher than expected. In addition, China’s economic reopening would translate to greater commercial activity, which is positive. However, it also means greater resource consumption, leading to higher prices. Therefore, it’s important to consider stocks to buy that may ride out the Fed’s hawkish strategy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$210.47DGDollar General$227.82ALLAllstate$135.05WTRGEssential Utilities$46.15SRESempra Energy$158.49ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.59PSXPhillips 66$99.54Stocks to Buy: Five Below (FIVE)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWith the Fed signaling that its top priority centers on controlling inflation, investors may want to target relatively upscale discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). Unlike literal dollar stores, Five Below carries prices up to its namesake price. As well, it features a select range of products that can go up to $25. Therefore, the company provides several compelling products that should appeal to a broader consumer base.Fundamentally, Five Below may buffet the storm of the higher rates necessary to bring inflation down to a low level. Basically, the classical definition of inflation is a circumstance where more dollars chase after fewer goods. With deflation, fewer dollars chase after more goods. But to get deflation, a central bank must usually crimp demand, which would hurt the labor market. Unfortunately, this dynamic suggests that consumers must make do with less. However, such a framework would likely benefit Five Below. Therefore, FIVE stands among the stocks to buy.Story continuesStocks to Buy: Dollar General (DG)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comUnder a similar philosophy to Five Below above, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) presents an effective name among stocks to buy. True, Dollar General might typically be an idea to mitigate the impact of ever-rising prices. However, the dollar store can also perform relatively well under deflationary forces. Again, such a condition implies a negative impact on the workforce, which means discount retailers will gain tremendous relevance.What I appreciate about DG as one of the stocks to buy ahead of the Fed’s potentially hawkish measures is its objective discount. According to Gurufocus.com’s DCF analysis, DG represents a modestly undervalued investment. Specifically, the investment resource calculates the fair value at $273.35. However, the market priced DG at $227.82 at the time of writing.Also, Dollar General benefits from excellent operational strengths. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.6%, outpacing 86.57% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 6.49%, beating out more than 87% of its peers. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $264.93, implying over 16% upside potential.Stocks to Buy: Allstate (ALL)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For the Fed’s efforts to contain inflation, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is an excellent candidate for stocks to buy. And that’s because whether we’re talking inflation, deflation, or some other kind of “flation” – including the dreaded stagflation – Allstate delivers. It has to be because the company benefits richly from a hostage audience.  For instance, almost every state in the Union requires auto drivers to carry at least liability insurance. Further, those rare jurisdictions that allow people to drive sans insurance must demonstrate proof of financial wherewithal. Basically, it’s just better to carry insurance, primarily because of the fear of the unknown.Plus, when the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, insurance pays. I mean, it can really save your hind end, even with a hefty deductible. In exchange for hundreds of dollars, you’ll spare yourself the pain of tens of thousands of dollars.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $142.31, implying over 5% growth. With a dividend yield of 2.52%, Allstate may be boring but it gets the job done.Essential Utilities (WTRG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAgainst a longer-term framework, arguably most people understand (and perhaps appreciate) what the Fed’s doing. If inflation continues to rise out of control, the economy may suffer substantial damage. However, getting to the point of low inflation is a major pain. To mitigate the possible incoming volatility, investors should consider Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) as one of the stocks to buy.A drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and service provider, Essential Utilities carries the underlying sector’s major advantage: a natural monopoly. Due to the extraordinarily high barrier to entry, few entities can compete with Essential. Cynically, this dynamic bodes very well for WTRG stock.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company enjoys excellent operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.7% of its peers. Also, its net margin pings at 22%, above nearly 88% of the sector. Lastly, Wall Street analysts love WTRG, pegging it a unanimous strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying over 15% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAs with Essential Utilities above, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) ranks among the stocks to buy because of its natural monopoly advantage. Despite Sempra’s customers complaining up a storm about its business practices over the years, no one can replace it. Nor can anyone provide an alternative: the barrier to entry simply rates well above most enterprises’ pay grade, particularly in California.Speaking of the Golden State, Sempra’s other advantages center on its geographic location. Covering much of Southern California, Sempra benefits from an economic powerhouse of the biggest engine of the U.S. While people complain about California and its high prices, the state continues to attract top-tier talent. Frankly, it’s too important of a region to ignore. Plus, when you’re dealing with such a lucrative market, the customers’ ability to pay becomes less of an issue. That’s something to keep in mind for stocks to buy as the Fed targets low inflation.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target of $172.50 implies nearly 9% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is one of the stocks to buy as the Fed attempts to spark low inflation. Because of the core necessity of the underlying sector, ADM can rise irrespective of fluctuating monetary cycles. After all, humans must eat, irrespective of what’s going on with the interest rate environment.Notably, ADM gained over 6% in the trailing year. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped more than 5% during the same period. Part of its resilience stems from its passive income. Presently, the company carries a forward yield of 2.21%. As well, the enterprise commands 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. That’s a status management won’t give up on without a major fight. Convincingly, Wall Street analysts peg ADM as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $104.20, implying upside potential of nearly 28%. Thus, ADM ranks among the top stocks to buy for the rough journey to low inflation.Phillips 66 (PSX)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the sector’s value chain. This involves refining and marketing. Fundamentally, Phillips 66 benefits from purchases of necessity. While the electric vehicle revolution may be occurring right now, the vast majority of people drive combustion-powered cars. Thus, PSX will stay relevant for quite some time.In the trailing year, Phillips 66 shares gained over 18% of equity value. Since the January opener, though, they slipped about 1.5%. However, this might be a buying opportunity as provides a compelling case from a passive income perspective. Right now, its forward yield stands at 4.22%. Moreover, it’s a stable yield thanks to its low payout ratio of 32.66%.Financially, PSX trades at a trailing multiple of 4.34. As a discount to earnings, the oil firm ranks better than 71.26% of the competition. In addition, it trades at 0.28 times sales. For this metric, Phillips 66 ranks better than 81.39% of sector peers. Thus, it’s a compelling example of stocks to buy for the low-inflation journey.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

I'm very pleased that our company will continue to benefit from both of their financial expertise and decades of TJX experience and leadership. I'd like to start today by thanking all of our global associates for their great work in 2022. I am truly appreciative of their continued commitment to both TJX and our customers. I want to give special recognition though to our store, distribution center and fulfillment center associates for their hard work and dedication every single day.Story continuesNow to an overview of our results beginning with the fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with our strong top line performance. Our better-than-expected U.S. comp store sales increase of 4% was driven by the excellent performance at our Marmaxx division, which delivered its strongest quarter of the year. We also saw positive U.S. customer traffic in the fourth quarter, which was also driven by Marmaxx. Our exciting assortment of gifts and great values resonated with shoppers this holiday season. I believe the freshness of our mix really sets us apart as we shipped ever-changing selections to our stores and online throughout the quarter. In terms of profitability, pretax profit margin increased over last year. Our merchant organization continue to do a great job buying better and retailing strategically, which drove excellent mark on.Unfortunately, we had an outsized shrink charge in the fourth quarter that resulted in pretax profit margin coming in below our plan, which John will discuss in a moment. For the full year, total sales were nearly $50 billion. Profitability improved over last year, and adjusted earnings per share grew 9%. I want to again recognize all of our talented associates around the world for the excellent execution of our flexible off-price business model throughout the year. Their collective efforts drove outstanding value on our assortment, excitement in our stores and the satisfaction of our customers. Moving to 2023, the first quarter is off to a strong start. We are excited about our plans to drive sales and customer traffic and are laser-focused on initiatives to drive profitability this year and beyond.Availability of quality branded merchandise is phenomenal. We are in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities we are seeing in the marketplace. Further, we are convinced that our commitment to value and our treasure hunt shopping experience will continue to serve us well in this environment. Importantly, we continue to see many opportunities to capture market share and improve profitability over both the short and long term. Now before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our fourth quarter and full year financial results in more detail.John Klinger: Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be starting in this new role, and I want to add my sincere thanks to Scott for his guidance and mentorship over the years, and I look forward to continuing to work with them. I would also like to echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and commitment throughout 2022. I'll start with some additional details on the fourth quarter. As Ernie mentioned, U.S. comp store sales increased 4%, exceeding our expectations. Our U.S. comp growth was driven by a very strong 7% comp sales increase at Marmaxx. For the fourth quarter, average basket was up in the U.S., driven by a higher average ticket and U.S. customer traffic was up.TJX net sales grew to $14.5 billion, a 5% increase versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and despite a significant impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Fourth quarter consolidated pretax profit margin of 9.2% was up 20 basis points versus last year, and merchandise margin was down slightly. Within merchandise margin, strong mark-on was offset by higher markdowns, which were compared to exceptionally low markdowns last year. Freight was a benefit in the fourth quarter. Further, we had an unplanned shrink charge of 60 basis points versus last year. I want to note that our fourth quarter pretax profit margin guidance contemplated an expected 50 basis point benefit from shrink due to the elevated charge in the fourth quarter of last year.Therefore, the negative impact of shrink versus our pretax profit margin guidance was 110 basis points. Lastly, we're pleased that earnings per share were $0.89, up 14% at the high end of our plans. Moving to our fourth quarter divisional performance. At Marmaxx, fourth quarter comp store sales increased a very strong 7% over a 10% open-only comp increase last year. Marmaxx's comp increase was driven by apparel and accessory categories, which had a high single-digit comp increase. Further, in the fourth quarter, customer traffic was the main driver of the comp increase and average basket also increased. Marmaxx's fourth quarter segment profit margin was 11.6%. HomeGoods fourth quarter comp store sales decrease of 7% versus an outsized 22% open-only comp increase last year.HomeGoods fourth quarter segment profit margin was 7.3%. Internationally, we're pleased with the performance of both our TJX Canada and TJX International divisions in the fourth quarter. At our Canadian division, net sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis versus last year. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was up 12.5%, which exceeded their fiscal '20 margin. And at our International division, net sales on a constant currency basis were up 11% versus last year. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was up 7.2% -- excuse me, segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 7.2%. Now to our full year consolidated fiscal 2023 results. U.S. comp sales were flat versus a 17% U.S. open-only comp sales increase last year.TJX net sales grew to $49.9 billion, up 3% compared to fiscal '22 despite a significant impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Full year adjusted pretax profit margin was 9.7%, a 10 basis point increase versus last year's adjusted 9.6% and merchandise margin was down. Within merchandise margin, strong mark-on was more than offset by 120 basis points of incremental freight costs and higher markdowns, which, again, were up against exceptionally low markdowns last year. Shrink expense negatively impacted full year merchandise margin by approximately 30 basis points and was not contemplated in our most recent full year guidance. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $3.11 at the high end of our plan and up 9% versus last year's adjusted $2.85.Moving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was down 2% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. We are confident that we are strongly positioned to both capitalize on the abundant merchandise in the marketplace and flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this spring. I'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the fourth quarter, we generated $3 billion in operating cash flow. For the full year, we generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash. In fiscal '23, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. Now I'll turn it back to Ernie.Most Promising Micro-Cap Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by AlphaTradeZoneErnie Herrman: Thanks, John. I'll pick it up with some full year divisional highlights. Before I begin to speak to them, however, individually, I want to highlight the outstanding performance of our teams across each of our divisions in 2022, while they navigated historic levels of inflation and an uncertain retail environment. All year long, each of our retail banners delivered shoppers an excellent assortment of apparel, accessories and home merchandise and offered great value every day. Beginning with Marmaxx. Full year comp store sales increased 3% and total divisional sales reached $30 billion. Marmaxx's apparel and accessories businesses were very strong all year long with a mid-single-digit comp increase. For the year, average basket was up significantly and customer traffic increased slightly.Marmaxx's full year segment profit margin was 12.7%. During the year, we opened a combined 50 T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores. Further, we remodeled approximately 225 stores, and the feedback from customers has been terrific. We are extremely pleased with the performance of our largest division and see a significant opportunity to continue growing the top and bottom lines. At HomeGoods, full year comp store sales decreased 11%. It is important to remember that last year, HomeGoods had a remarkable 32% comp sales increase as we saw consumers spend an outsized amount in home-related categories. While HomeGoods customer traffic was down for the year, average basket increased. HomeGoods full year segment profit margin was 6.3%. In 2022, we surpassed 900 stores for this division with the opening of over 50 HomeGoods and HomeSense stores.Long term, we continue to see the potential for HomeGoods to open over 500 additional stores and for profitability to significantly improve. At TJX Canada, net sales were nearly $5 billion and increased 18% on a constant currency basis. Segment profit margin increased to a very strong 14%. Our Canadian business operates more than 550 total stores and is very well penetrated throughout the country. TJX Canada is one of the top apparel, accessories and home retailers in that country and a sharper destination for several signature categories. We remain confident that TJX Canada is well positioned to capture additional market share over the short and long term. At TJX International, net sales surpassed $6 billion and increased 22% on a constant currency basis.Segment profit margin improved to 5.7% on a constant currency basis. In Europe, we believe we significantly outperformed many other major brick-and-mortar retailers as our values resonated with consumers in a heightened inflationary environment. In Australia, sales were very strong, and we continued expanding our store footprint across the country. Going forward, we believe that we can grow our market share in each country that we operate in and continue to improve this division's profitability. As to e-commerce, we added new categories and brands to each of our online banners in 2022. While e-commerce only represents a very small percentage of our overall net sales, it allows us to offer shoppers our great brands and values 24 hours a day.As we look ahead, we are convinced that the characteristics of our business and the depth of talent in our organization will allow us to capitalize on the opportunities that we see to further grow our top and bottom lines. First, we are in an excellent position to continue offering consumers great value and freshness every day. We have a team of more than 1,200 buyers who source from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors last year, including many new ones. Our ability to buy goods across good, better and best categories gives us tremendous flexibility in the vendor marketplace. Again, availability of merchandise is phenomenal, and we are confident that we'll have plenty of quality branded goods going forward. Second, we are convinced that the appeal of our touch and field treasure hunt shopping experience will continue to resonate with consumers.Giving us confidence is the continued strength of our customer satisfaction scores. Further, our leadership and flexibility allows us to take advantage of the best opportunities and the hottest trends in the marketplace. This allows us to offer our shoppers an assortment of merchandise to surprise and excite them every time they visit. We are also focused on being a gift-giving destination all year long. Third, our convenient, easy-to-access store locations attract consumers across a wide income demographic. Our eclectic mix of good, better and best merchandise across categories allows us to offer a branded, fashionable mix across a wide span of price points. We see these as key advantages as we continue to expand our store footprint. Long term, we see the potential to open more than 1,400 additional stores across our current geographies, which we believe will attract even more shoppers to our great assortments and values.Next, our marketing has been very effective in targeting consumers with broad reaching and compelling brand campaigns across different channels and platforms where consumers are currently spending their time. Our messaging is continuing to reinforce our value leadership and demonstrate that we are one of the best choices for consumers during the current economic environment. We are particularly pleased that we continue to attract an outsized number of younger customers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for the future. As to our profitability outlook, we are planning an increase in our fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin to a range of 10.0% to 10.2%. Beyond this year, our target remains to return to our fiscal 2020 pretax profit margin level of 10.6% by fiscal 2025.Giving us confidence are the sales, better buying and strategic retailing opportunities we see going forward at each division. John will outline the other assumptions embedded in our plans in a moment. Turning to corporate responsibility. We continue to focus our global corporate responsibility efforts under our 4 key pillars: workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. Last quarter, I noted that TJX published its 2022 Global Corporate Responsibility Report which summarizes the company's ESG efforts and progress across these 4 reporting areas. And as a reminder, in fiscal 2023, we set expanded and accelerated global environmental goals, including a goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our operations by 2040.We are working hard to make progress toward our goals and help mitigate our impact on the environment. I'd also like to take a moment to speak about the work our teams are doing in our communities. In fiscal 2023, we helped support more than 2,000 nonprofit organizations globally. We're very proud of the impact this has had, including helping to provide more than 25 million meals to individuals experiencing food insecurity and helping with access to educational opportunities for more than 1 million students from under-resourced communities. We also continue to support nonprofits working towards racial justice through new grants to several national organizations. Finally, for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, we were able to restart our in-person community relations programs and have seen a resurgence in volunteering across our organization.In the past 6 months alone, our U.S. associates provided more than 2,400 hours of service to their communities. I'm grateful to our teams around the globe for the work they do to support our global corporate responsibility priorities and we are proud to continue to make progress across our many programs and initiatives. As always, we invite you to visit tjx.com to learn more. Summing up, we feel great about our performance in 2022 and our momentum heading into 2023. I am confident that the strength and resiliency of our flexible off-price business model and the depth of expertise and knowledge of our teams, set us apart from many other major retailers and will continue to serve us well. I want to again recognize the exceptional talent we have across the organization.It is their collective efforts and execution of our off-price fundamentals that bring our business to life for our shoppers every day. As an off-price leader in every country we operate in, I'm excited about the market share opportunities we see ahead in both the U.S. and internationally. I am very confident in our plans to grow TJX into an increasingly profitable $6 billion-plus revenue company over the long term. Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and first quarter guidance and then we'll open it up for questions.John Klinger: Thanks again, Ernie. Before I start, I want to remind you that our guidance includes a 53rd week in the fiscal 2024 calendar. Additionally, in fiscal '24, we are returning to reporting overall comp store sales growth versus fiscal '23 as we now have a baseline for our TJX Canada and TJX International divisions. Now to our full year guidance. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3%. As a reminder, our comp guidance will exclude sales from the 53rd week. We expect full year consolidated sales to be in the range of $52.5 billion to $53.2 billion, a 5% to 7% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes approximately $800 million of additional revenue from the 53rd week. We're planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%, excluding an expected benefit of approximately 10 basis points from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.2%.This would represent an increase of 30 to 50 basis points versus fiscal '23's adjusted pretax profit margin of 9.7%. Our pretax profit margin guidance assumes that we will see a benefit of about 80 to 100 basis points from lower freight expenses as well as a continued benefit from better buying and strategic retailing. We're planning these benefits to more than offset continuing headwinds from incremental wage and supply chain costs. Also contemplated in our guidance is that shrink will be similar to last year. For modeling purposes, we're currently anticipating a full year tax rate of 26.1%, net interest income of about $116 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.16 billion. We expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.51, excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.41.This would represent an increase of 6% to 10% versus fiscal '23 adjusted earnings per share of $3.11. Moving to the first quarter. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3%. We expect first quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion, a 3% to 4% increase over the prior year. We're planning first quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%. This guidance includes an expected benefit from freight of 130 basis points in headwinds from a combination of incremental wage and supply chain and the timing of some expenses. For modeling purposes, we're currently anticipating a first quarter tax rate of 26.4%, net interest income of about $29 million a weighted average share count of approximately 1.17 billion.Lastly, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.71. Moving on to our fiscal '23 capital plans. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This includes opening new stores, remodels and relocations and investments in our distribution network and infrastructure to support our growth. For new stores, we plan to add about 150 net new stores which would bring our year-end total to nearly 5,000 stores. This would represent a store growth of about 3%. In the U.S., our plans call for us to add about 45 net stores at Marmaxx, 50 stores at HomeGoods, including 18 at including 18 HomeSense stores. At Sierra, we're planning to open 18 stores. In Canada, we plan to add 11 new stores.And at TJX International, we plan to open 18 net stores in Europe and 6 net stores in Australia. Lastly, we also plan to remodel 400 stores and relocate approximately 55 stores in fiscal '24. As to our fiscal '24 cash distribution plans, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. As we outlined in today's press release, we expect that our Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.3325 per share. Additionally, in fiscal '24, we currently expect to buy back 2 billion to 2.5 billion of TJX stock. I'll finish by highlighting the assumptions we've included in our fiscal '25 pretax profit margin target of 10.6%. First, our outlook assumes that overall comp store sales will increase 3% to 4%. Secondly, as I just highlighted, we're expecting freight to be a significant tailwind in fiscal '24, with a smaller benefit expected in fiscal '25.Third, we expect that incremental wage and supply chain cost will continue to be headwinds in both fiscal '24 and fiscal '25. Further, our plans assume that shrink will remain similar to fiscal '23 over the next 2 years. Next, as Ernie highlighted, our plans assume additional merchandise margin opportunities across all our divisions. Lastly, I'll mention that certain macro factors we haven't made assumptions for could change our plans such as geopolitical events, foreign exchange volatility, consumer behavior or a worsening shrink environment. In closing, I want to emphasize that we have a very strong balance sheet and continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash. We are in an excellent financial position to invest in the growth in our business while simultaneously returning cash to our shareholders.Now we are happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person so we can keep the call on schedule and answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.See also Analysts Are Downgrading These Stocks and 10 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According to Buffett.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

We successfully navigated last year's challenges including inflation, supply chain disruptions, energies price spikes, and the steep rise in interest rates to deliver a GAAP earnings of $2.06 per share, and non-GAAP operating earnings of $3.47 per share, placing our results for the full year above the midpoint of our 2022 non-GAAP earnings guidance.Story continuesIn fact, 2022 was the 18th year in a row that PSEG has delivered non-GAAP results at or above management's original operating earnings guidance. PSE&amp;G which contributed the vast majority of our results posted in 8.2% annual increase in net income from the continued investment in its TND infrastructure, clean energy programs and a first full year of decoupling. PSE&amp;G invested over $3 billion of capital during 2022 in transmission upgrades, gas system modernization, energy efficiency, electric vehicle infrastructure and launched our efforts to address the reliability of the last mile of our distribution system. At year end 2022, PSE&amp;G's rate base topped $26.4 billion a 7.7% increase over the year end 2021. We know the importance shareholders placed on a predictability and visibility of our financial results and during the past 12 months we have taken many steps to deliver just that.First, we completed the strategic alternatives process, which included the sale of PSE&amp;G fossil last February. This increased the regulated contribution to about 90% of our consolidated non-GAAP earnings. We completed a $500 million share repurchase program in May of 2022 and increased the cash return to shareholders by raising the annual dividend by $0.12 or 5.9% for 2022. Second, the passage of the inflation reduction act of 2022 will offer our nuclear generation a level of much needed stability when it goes into effect in 2024. While the industry waits for clarifications, we believe the inflation reduction act is a game changer that should provide the stability required for long term financial viability of the U.S. nuclear fleet. As a result of the nuclear production tax credits extending through at least 2032 we are now able to consider small but important value added investments, including the potential for capacity upgrades to a fuel cycle extension to hold Creek and the license extension of our New Jersey units.Critical to these decisions will be our determination of how predictable and visible nuclear revenues could be beyond our current three years ZEC window. The Ira also created valuable incentives for PSE&amp;G's customers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles, which will advanced New Jersey's decarbonisation goals and expand our opportunities to invest in last mile reliability and make ready infrastructure. This aligns with the recent state objectives to increase electrification. Just last week, Governor Murphy issued three executive orders that establish or accelerate the state's existing 2050 targets for clean source energy, building electrification and electric vehicle adoption goals with new target dates in 2030 and 2035. The Board of Public Utilities and other state agencies were directed to collaborate with stakeholders to develop plans to reach these goals.These include an updated energy master plan in 2024, and a new proceeding to develop a future of natural gas utility plant to consider new revenue streams, such as conversion of existing facilities to district geothermal, and new technologies to meet the 2019 energy master plan goal of 50% reduced emissions below 2006 levels by 2030. Third, we announced our strategic decision to exit our investment in offshore wind generation by selling our 25% equity stake in Ocean Wind 1 backdoor joint venture partner Ãrsted. This decision to exit or short generation was consistent with our goal to increase the predictability of our business. PSE&amp;G will continue to provide Ocean Wind 1 to onshore construction management services to ensure the onshore substations and associated onshore cabling are ready to receive the project's output when it goes in service.We also intend to continue pursuing regulated transmission projects offshore and investing in related transmission and distribution projects onshore and enabling the New Jersey wind port in Salem County. Finally, last week, the BPU approved the settlement of our pension accounting filing, retroactive to January 1, 2023. An important step we have pursued to limit pension expense volatility. This improved business platform created by the strategic actions we have taken over the past two years, combined with our efforts to increase the predictability of our results, positions us to narrow our 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings to a range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share from our original guidance of $3.35 to $3.55 a share provided last November. This new $0.10 range compares to the $0.20 range we have provided in previous years.These strategic rules also drive our outlook for long term compound annual earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2027 and enable us to pursue this growth path without the need to issue new equity during this five year period. Moving into 2023, we extended our 2022 dividend increase of $0.12 per share to set the 2023 indicative annual rate at $2.28 per share, marking our 116th year of paying a dividend to shareholders. PSE&amp;G has begun executing its capital investment plan of over $3.4 billion for 2023 which is expected to be the largest single year spend in utilities 120 year history. This will be directed primarily towards infrastructure replacement, energy efficiency and last mile reliability. The good news is that additional headroom was created in our gas and combined customer bill, as the recent decline in natural gas prices has enabled PSE&amp;G to reduce its residential default gas supply rate by $0.15 to $0.15 per therm for the balance of the winter 2020 to 2023 heating season.This decrease in the pastor commodity charge will reduce the typical residential winter gas bill by $13 per month annualized or 11.5%. Speaking of our customers, they rated PSE&amp;G number one in 2022 JV Power customer satisfaction studies for both residential electric and natural gas service in the East among large utilities. This is the first time we have achieved both number one rankings in the same year. This honor culminated the year that saw PSEG recognized by the Edison Electric Institute with the Edison award, the industry's highest honor, for leadership and innovation. And speaking of leadership, PSEG's environmental, social and governance credentials continue to be recognized. In addition to our MSCI upgrades to triple A, its highest ESG rating PSEG was also named for the Dow Jones Sustainability North America index for the 15th year in a row, as well as just 100 list of America's most just companies for 2023 recognizes our commitment to serving our customers, workforce, communities, the environment and shareholders.None of this could be accomplished without our employees, who remain PSEG's most important resource. Together, we continue to be guided by PSEG's long standing commitment to operational excellence, discipline, investment, and financial strength. As I recognize our employees, I must take a moment to honor one that lost his life in a tragic act of violence. Some of you may have heard about the horrible loss when a member of the PSEG team was killed by a former employee. It was one of the saddest days in our company's history. Our condolences and prayers go out to all of those that have been impacted by this event. I also want to thank our employees who supported each other during this difficult time. We will continue to provide resources to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of all PSEG employees, including grief counseling for any employee seeking it.In closing, and as I mentioned earlier, we know the important stakeholders play some predictability and visibility of our financial results and goals. I have made increasing both factors, a key focus of PSEG's strategic plan. We intend to share the details of this plan on our upcoming investor conference on March 10 as we continue to build a practical path for decarbonizing the New Jersey economy. I'll now turn the call over to Dan and return after his remarks for Q&amp;A.Dan Cregg: Thank you, Ralph. Good morning everybody. For the full year 2022 GAAP earnings were $2.06 per share, compared to a GAAP loss of $1.29 per share for the full year of 2021, which included fossil sale related impairments. Non-GAAP results for $3.47 per share for 2022 compared to 2021's non-GAAP results of $3.65 per share, which you may recall excluded depreciation related to the fossil assets held for sale in the fourth quarter of '21 and retirement of power debt. For the fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP earnings improved to $1.58 per share, compared with $0.88 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.64 per share compared with $0.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 which contain the fossil sale related items I just mentioned.We provided information on slides 9 and 11 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings by business on the fourth quarter and full year periods ended December 31. Slides 10 and 12 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and non-GAAP operating earnings by major business which I will review now starting with PSE&amp;G. Full year 2022 net income rose by $119 million or over 8% to $1.565 billion compared to 2021 net income of $1.446 billion reflecting higher earnings from continued investment in TND programs and the favorable impact of a full year of decoupling in 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the utilities net income rose by $81 million to $352 million or $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021.As you can see on Slide 10 transmission margin and a penny per share compared to the year earlier quarter, reflecting growth and rate base partly offset by the timing of O&amp;M recovery. Gas, electric and other margin contributed combined to add $0.07 per share compared with last year's fourth quarter reflecting GSMP II roll-ins the Conservation incentive program or CIP decoupling for both electric and gas, appliance service and other margins. On the expense side, O&amp;M was flat versus the prior year quarter. Higher distribution depreciation and interest expense each reduce results by a penny per share reflecting higher plant in service and investment. Lower pension expense added a penny per share versus a year ago quarter and flow through taxes the impact of lower outstanding shares and other items added $0.10 per share compared to the fourth quarter of '21 with $0.07 of that amount reversing the timing impact of taxes from prior quarters in 2022.During '22, PSEG invested over $3 billion in planned capital spending to upgrade transmission and distribution facilities, enhance reliability and increased resiliency. In 2022, we also launched the IAP our $511 million infrastructure advancement program, which the BPU authorized last June to improve the reliability of the last mile of our electric distribution system and address aging substations and gas M&amp;R stations. As Ralph mentioned a year in 2022 PSE&amp;G's rate base stood at approximately $26.4 billion a 7.7% increase over year end 2021. Last Friday, the Board of Public Utilities approved an order authorizing PSE&amp;G to modify its method of pension accounting for ratemaking purposes, which will mitigate variability in the calculation of PSE&amp;G's pension expense for calendar year 2023 and beyond.The backdrop of economic conditions continue to improve in New Jersey during 2022. New Jersey's unemployment rate return to pre-pandemic levels of 3.3% in September, and remain below the national average at year end. System peak load reached 10,147 megawatts on August 9, exceeding the 10,000 megawatt level for the second year in a row. Weather normalized electric sales increased by 2% for the year with residential sales flat and CNI sales increasing by 3%. Weather normalize gas sales were flat for the year with residential gas sales down 1% while CNI sales increased by 2%. mechanism because the impact of most customer usage from margin subject to earnings or rate cap limitations, leaving the change in the number of customers as the major driver of margin growth going forward.The number of electric and gas customer rose by approximately 1% each in 2022. Wrapping up the utility update. We've narrowed our forecast of PSE&amp;G's net income for 2023 To $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion which reflects pension and OPEB updates compared to 2022 offset by the benefit of contemporaneously recovered investments, predictability of utility margin from the safety coupling, as well as the implementation of the pension accounting filing effective for calendar year '23. Now turning to carbon free infrastructure another. For full year 22 CFIOs net loss of $534 million or $1.06 per share reflected higher losses on both mark to market transactions and nuclear decommissioning trust fund related activity. The full year 2021 net loss included impairments and debt extinguishment costs related to the fossil sale.Non-GAAP operating earnings declined $174 million or $0.35 per share from $407 million for full year '21 reflecting the absence of the fossil assets. The fourth quarter 22 CFIOs net income improved to $436 million or $0.88 per share from $174 million in the year ago quarter, reflecting higher gains on both mark to market transactions and NDT fund related activities. Net income for the fourth quarter 21 included debt extinguishment costs and other charges related to the sale of fossil. For the fourth quarter 2022 the non-GAAP operating earnings loss of $34 million or $0.06 per share reflected the absence of the fossil assets compared to the fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of $81 million or $0.68 per share, which reflected the cessation of depreciation and lower interest costs related to the fossil sale.Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashReferring again to Slide 10, non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.22 per share lower in the fourth quarter than the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by lower capacity prices for the remaining nuclear fleet, but regeneration volume recontracting lower prices and lower deck revenue compared to the year ago quarter. Combined these items drove electric gross margin to decline $0.34 per share. Gas operations improved by $0.04 per share, reflecting higher off system sales, higher commodity pricing and higher stores. Power related cost comparisons for the fourth quarter 2022 improve his overall O&amp;M expense was $0.07 per share favorable compared to the year ago quarter. Again reflecting fossil assets sale, partly offset by the plan refueling at the 100% owned Hope Creek nuclear plant in this year's fourth quarter.Appreciation and interests were higher by a penny per share that reflected the March 2022 debt issuance of power versus the year earlier debt retirements related to the fossil sale. Activity was a pay per share favorable compare the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflecting the essence of 2021's donation to the PSEG foundation, partly offset by higher parent interest of $0.04. Taxes and other improved by a penny per share over the fourth quarter of 2021 and includes the accelerated receipt of expected tax carried out claim in '22 instead of '23, which is partially offset by the reversing of a timing impact from tax benefits in prior quarters in 2022. Turning to ops. The nuclear fleet operated and an average capacity factor of 85.8% during the fourth quarter, which included the Hope Creek and 7.3 terawatt hours requirement for generation.An unplanned outage at Salem unit two in late December 2022 occurred during a PJM region wide generation emergency action and resulted in capacity performance penalties. The net financial impact of the outage including replacement power, capacity penalties, as well as bonuses earned by the other operating PSEG units did not expect it to be material. For the full year the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 92.2% producing 31.3 terawatt hours of generation. PSEG's forecasting total baseline baseload nuclear generation of approximately 31 terawatt hours for the full year of 23 hedged 95% to 100% and an average price of $31 per megawatt hour an increase of about $4 per megawatt hour compared to '22. For '24 total nuclear generation is forecast also to be approximately 31 terawatt hours, and 55% to 60% hedged than an average price of $32 per megawatt hour.In addition, in December, we exited certain legacy BGS or basic generation service contracts in order to rebalance our hedge portfolio and realign it to our baseload nuclear fleet and reduce volatility in 2023. Wrapping up CFIO we've narrowed our forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings to $200 million to $225 million from $185 million to $235 million. A quick update on financing activity and collateral postings. As of December 31, 2022, total available credit capacity was $3.7 billion including a billion at PSE&amp;G. In addition, we have total cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $465 million. PSEG power had net cash collateral postings of $1.5 billion at December 31 primarily related to as a money hedge positions resulting from higher energy prices, which declined to $700 million through last Friday.Given the recent improvement in our collateral position, in January of this year, we prepaid $750 of a $1.5 billion short term loan that was due in April. Following the repayment of this term loan, PSEG had outstanding a total of $1.25 billion of 365 day term loans expiring this spring to support powers collateral needs and power had an outstanding a $1.25 billion term loan expiring in March of 2025. Combined, these term loans comprise $2.5 billion a variable rate debt. As we mentioned during our third quarter call, we entered into interest rate swaps during September and October of last year, which converted $1.05 billion of our outstanding term loans from floating to fixed rate reducing our variable rate debt exposure. Following the measurement of the pension at year end 2022, we've incorporated the impact of the actual 2022 investment returns, discount rate and interest rates into the 2023 pension .Our expected return on plan assets increased to 8.1% for 2023, as the declining value of the fixed income securities due to higher interest rates during '22 enables a higher yield on them going forward. While 2022 investment returns has a negative impact on 2023 pension calculations, the increase in interest rates serves to reduce the pension liability with the funded status of a pension plan, ending the year at a solid 87%. In addition, the county settlement approved by the BPU will create a regulatory asset or liability to overlay our current accounting, which will partly mitigate the impact of certain expense related pension calculations going forward. As Ralph mentioned earlier, we've narrowed our 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance to $3.40 to $3.50 per share around the same $3.45 per share midpoint, with regulated operations continuing to contribute approximately 90% of that total.As a reminder, PSEG does not forecast GAAP earnings related and related long term growth rates. PSE&amp;G's forecast of 2023 net income is narrowed to $1.500 billion to $1.525 billion reflecting the predictability provided by the expected transmission distribution investment recovery, and focus on owned and cost control. Non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for CFIO is now forecasted at $200 million to $225 million. CFIOs narrowed guidance also removed the previously expected benefits of the tax carry back claim from PSEG's 2023 operating guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks. So Shamali please open the line. And we'll take some questions.See also 11 High Growth Utility Stocks to Buy and 10 Tech Stocks To Sell Now According to Cathie Wood.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, NRG Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while PSEG has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that NRG likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PEG has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.60, while PEG has a forward P/E of 17.74. We also note that NRG has a PEG ratio of 6. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PEG currently has a PEG ratio of 7.52.Another notable valuation metric for NRG is its P/B ratio of 2. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PEG has a P/B of 2.29.Based on these metrics and many more, NRG holds a Value grade of B, while PEG has a Value grade of F.Story continuesNRG is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

The index is expected to be up 0.4% from a month earlier, compared with 0.3% the previous month.Story continuesClose Brothers Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer, Robert Alster, said markets were upbeat about the strength of consumer spending in many of the major economies at the moment but also wary about inflation staying higher for longer and extending the rise in interest rates.""That is why were are all hanging on each data point,"" Alster said. ""There is a feeling it is going to be volatile, a bit like being cautiously optimistic skating on thin ice"" he added. ""We are virtually neutral now on all asset classes.""UNWELCOME ANNIVERSARYWall Street was pointing lower again having ended a topsy-turvy Thursday in positive territory for the first time in five sessions, although it too remains on course for its worst week of the year.The expectations that U.S. interest rates might need to rise for longer meant the dollar index, which measures the top world currency against six of its main peers, was up 0.25% at a seven-week high of 104.859. On Thursday, an unexpected fall in new claims for unemployment and a revised uptick in the fourth-quarter PCE price index, suggested some lasting strength in the world's largest economy.""The U.S. dollar index should extend its rise towards 106 if today's U.S. PCE deflators lift the US Treasury 2Y yield above the 4.5-4.75% Fed Funds Rate range,"" said analysts at DBS Bank.A year on from Russia sending its troops into Ukraine, the focus remained the loss of life and long-term geopolitical implications, although the spillovers of the war have had a major impact on financial markets.Aaron Dunn, co-head of value equity at Eaton Vance, said the most obvious had been the sharp increase in oil and gas and agricultural prices when the war broke out. Notably though, most of those moves have been completely reversed.""You have basically retracted a fair amount of the gains in most of the energy markets in the back half of 2022,"" Dunn said, highlighting that the slump in natural gas prices following a mild winter meant gas use was now replacing coal again in Europe.""That has helped the global economic picture,"" he explained. ""The big question is now the top line, the economic performance, and in that respect China's reopening will play an outsized role in the direction we go from here.""The overnight comments from BOJ head-elect Ueda on Japan's easy-money policy had seen Japan's Nikkei share index close up 1.3%, while its five-year government bond yield eased to 0.235%.Ten-year Japanese bonds didn't trade on Friday due to thin liquidly, after breaching the upper limit of the BOJ's policy cap for two straight days.

And thanks to Europe's mild winter, brimming storage and gas substitution, yearend natural gas prices are back to where they were 11 months ago - down more than 31% so far in 2023.But it's the pickup and stickiness in underlying ""core"" prices, excluding energy and food, that is irking the central banks and the Federal Reserve most of all.And if the world economy is gathering some steam again in 2023, as recent numbers suggest, interest rate policy may have to be a lot harsher than everyone has assumed.Alongside another tight U.S. weekly jobs report, markets got another glimpse of those price pressures on Thursday.The Commerce Department showed inflation increased much faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter of last year, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure that the Fed favours accelerating at a 4.3% pace compared with prior estimate of 3.9%.The revisions to prices were led by used and new motor vehicles and fees for nonprofit hospital services.Friday gets a more updated monthly view of core PCE from January and it's not yet clear if quarterly revisions affect the standing consensus forecast for an easing of the rate to 4.3% from 4.4% in December - still more than twice the Fed's target.Markets are now braced for three more quarter-point rate hikes from the Fed to at least 5.25%-5.50%, with no cut fully priced from there by yearend. At 4.71% on Friday, two-year Treasury yields are close to cycle highs.Story continuesAlthough cheered on Thursday by chip designer Nvidia's blowout earnings and upbeat outlook, S&amp;P500 stock futures are back in the red - barely clinging to the pivotal 4,000 point level.And increasingly buoyed by the still intense geopolitical fallout from a year of the war in Ukraine, the dollar pushed higher yet again.Whether China now backs Moscow militarily as well as rhetorically is seen as one of the biggest global questions surrounding the war 12 months on and would mark critical juncture in Western relations with Beijing too - and in trade globalisation more generally.China's offshore yuan fell to its lowest level of the year against the dollar on Friday.The dollar also rose against Japan's yen on Friday, with the Nikkei's 1% gain bucking the dour weekend mood elsewhere, after comments by the incoming Bank of Japan chief.Even though data showed Japan's core consumer inflation hitting a fresh 41-year high in January, Kazuo Ueda insisted the BOJ must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the fragile economy, warning of the dangers of responding to cost-driven inflation with monetary tightening.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. January personal income and spending, PCE inflation indices, January new home sales; Kansas City Fed February service sector survey * Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, Fed Board Governor Philip Jefferson, Boston Fed chief Susan Collins speak. Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro speaks * Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida chairs G7 leaders meeting.

128,eddc36ee-b33e-3773-adbf-382d83bc0fb9,M,2023-02-24,"GRAPHIC-One year of war in Europe: How the dollar, energy and food prices swirled",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-one-war-europe-dollar-093644481.html,1677231404,STORY,['M'],"[LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted economies and markets around the world, from energy and food prices to European banks, emerging market stocks and the Russian currency.Below are five charts that show how Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two has shaped global financial markets in the last 12 months.1/THE SAFEST OF SAFE HAVENSThere are many reasons why king dollar reigned supreme in the past year and one is its status as the ultimate safe haven at times of uncertainty. The economic fallout of the war, which hit currencies such as the euro hard, also lifted the dollar.The greenback is down from September's two-decade highs, but it's still up 8% against a basket of currencies since the conflict began.The impact on other safe havens such as governments bonds is complicated, however. Yes, U.S. and European bond prices rose in the days following Russia's invasion as investors sought safety in top quality assets.But they soon fell and yields soared as the war triggered an energy shock and inflation surged, while central banks responded with aggressive rate hikes. Germany's 10-year Bund yield has risen to 2.4% from just 0.2% on Feb. 23, 2022..2/THE STING IN THE PIPELINEThe war in Ukraine brought with it an energy crisis like no other. Post-COVID-19 reopening had already sent prices for anything from oil to coal to natural gas higher. But when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in late February, European natural gas prices rocketed by almost 400% in two weeks. By August, they were 700% higher than a year earlier.Pre-war, Russia supplied over 30% of Europe's gas, most of it through a network of pipelines, thousands of kilometres long. Once Western sanctions hit, the flows of gas dried up. Energy prices soared, bringing the threat of blackouts, recession and a worrying switch back to dirtier sources of fuel.Thankfully, winter has proven mild and Europe has found other suppliers, bringing the gas price back to around 50 MWh, its lowest since August 2021. But, there's a lag of around 6-9 months between what happens on the wholesale market and what happens to consumers' bills, meaning last August's punishing spike to almost 350 MWh - equivalent to an oil price of over $200 a barrel - hasn't even begun to bite.Story continues3/PRECIOUS FOODFood prices, which were already on a tear in 2021 after COVID-19, leaped again after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on fears of shortages and disruptions to Black Sea trade.Last year the U.N. food agency's average price index hit its highest level on record, up 14.3% from the previous year. The index had already gained 28% in 2021.Higher energy and input costs, adverse weather and continued strong global food demand are adding to pressure from significant market disruptions. Over the whole of 2022, four of the five food sub-indexes - cereals, meat, dairy and vegetable oils - reached record highs.Food price pressures are easing, but that does little to soften the blow for many developing nations, where food and energy prices make up a larger share of spending. Shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine mean the world is unlikely to meet a longstanding goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030, the World Bank has warned.4/ ROUBLE TROUBLEThe past year has seen wild swings for Russia's currency - a more than 50% tumble following the invasion to record lows in March, followed by a more than 200% rise to a multi-year high in June thanks to soaring energy prices, FX restrictions and the central bank ramping up interest rates. Twelve months on, the rouble is broadly back to its pre-war 12-month average.Russia wants a weaker rouble to boost hydrocarbon revenues, which is helping plug a widening budget deficit and soaring domestic spending due to the ballooning cost of the Ukraine war. But it is also attempting to shore up its finances by selling its foreign currency reserves, and started interventions for the first time in almost a year in January. Moscow burned through $38 billion of its rainy-day fund, the National Wealth Fund, in December alone to cover its deficit.Fresh pressure on the currency could come from sanctions: EU members are expected to approve a 10th package around the anniversary.5/TWO CAMPS FOR EU BANKSEuropean banks took a drubbing when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, those that have slashed links have outperformed and those that have not continue to see their shares take a hit.Raiffeisen Bank International's shares suffered their worst daily drop since the onset of the war on Monday, as the Austrian lender drew the attention of U.S. sanctions officials over its Russian business. Shares of Raiffeisen, deeply embedded in Russia's financial system, have slumped over 40% since the start of 2022.France's Societe Generale sold its Russia business Rosbank in May, taking a 3 billion euro ($3.18 billion) hit. Italy's UniCredit cut its cross-border exposure to Russia by two thirds, but still owns one of Russia's top 15 lenders. It has pledged to cut its presence, which has reassured investors. SocGen and UniCredit shares have rebounded from the post-invasion hit.

Krebs; President, CEO &amp; Director; Coeur Mining, Inc.Thomas S. Whelan; Senior VP &amp; CFO; Coeur Mining, Inc.Michael Stephan Dudas; Partner; Vertical Research Partners, LLCPresentationOperatorGood day, and welcome to the Coeur Mining Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mitchell Krebs, President and CEO. Please go ahead.Mitchell J. KrebsGood morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and 2022 earnings call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary language on forward-looking statements in today's slide deck and refer to our SEC filings on our website. I'll start with the main highlights on Slide 3 before turning the call over to Mick, Tom and Aoife. The fourth quarter was Coeur's strongest quarter of the year, which helped to achieve our overall full year production guidance for the third consecutive year, definitely not an easy task last year with such unprecedented volatility. Rochester was the main driver to our solid finish last year. Both silver and gold production increased over 30% quarter-over-quarter with sharply lower costs. Ongoing operational enhancements and higher grades contributed to Rochester's results as we begin the transition to the newly expanded infrastructure, where construction remains on track to be completed midyear. We achieved several critical objectives last year that we believe are important value drivers for the company in the short, medium and long term. In the short term, we continued to derisk and advance the Rochester expansion. The project is nearing 80% complete this month and remains on track in terms of budget and schedule. We also further fortified the balance sheet to support our elevated levels of investment in our existing assets that are intended to increase production, decrease costs, extend mine lives and drive a return to positive free cash flow, which Tom will provide more details on in a few minutes. In the medium term, the team at Kensington got an early jump on their multiyear development and drilling program last year by adding approximately 1.5 years to its mine life. As we laid out during our Investor Day in December, we're optimistic about further extending Kensington's mine life and generating solid returns from higher production and lower costs from this investment. Over the longer term, I want to highlight the great results from yesterday's reserve and resource update on Slide 11, which reflects another year of successfully replacing mine reserves. Year-over-year, our gold reserves increased by roughly 12%, while silver reserves increased approximately 3%. Over the past 5 years, we have invested roughly $245 million in exploration during a time when many companies have underinvested in this critical component of the business. Over that time, our gold equivalent reserves have expanded by 2 million ounces or roughly 34% net of depletion. In addition, our gold equivalent resources have increased nearly 4 million ounces or approximately 80%. Aoife will provide some additional comments on our exploration successes and our year-end reserve and resource results in a few minutes. Just a few quick thoughts as we look ahead to 2023. Overall, the key for us this year is obviously execution, not only at Rochester with the completion of construction and ramp-up post expansion, but across the entire portfolio to achieve our objectives that can transition the company back to positive free cash flow. We anticipate 2023 will be comprised of 2 very different halves. During the first half, capital intensity is expected to remain high while we experience weaker seasonal operating results from our 2 open pit operations. The first half also includes our normal first quarter outflows relating to 2022 tax, interest and compensation-driven payments. During the second half of the year, capital intensity is expected to sharply decline, and production levels are expected to increase as we begin the commissioning and ramp-up process at Rochester. Overall, 2023 production is expected to increase over last year, driven by Rochester's stronger second half and by an expected strong bounce-back year at Wharf after a lower-grade year in 2022. To quickly wrap up, we remain confident in the key pillars of what we think is a unique strategy in our sector and exclusively North American and U.S.-centric footprint, a contrarian multiyear commitment to exploration that continues to generate meaningful results, investments in expansions that are designed to deliver sector-leading growth and have transformative impacts on the business and a metals mix that offers meaningful and growing exposure to silver. An unrelenting focus by our team on executing this strategy is bringing us closer and closer to that point of transformation that everyone has been working so hard for. With that, I'll turn it over to Mick.Story continuesMichael RoutledgeThanks, Mitch. I'll start by echoing Mitch's comments on the great job our teams have done this last year to deliver guidance amid challenging circumstances. With the right people in the right chairs executing the right strategy, we feel confident in our ability to consistently deliver significant long-term value. Our journey to zero harm progressed well in 2022 with the teams delivering the best environmental health and safety performance in the history of the company. What a fantastic achievement to be proud of, but that journey is not over as we continue to control exposures as we drive to get to 0 as quickly and sustainably as possible. Turning to a brief recap of our fourth quarter production summary on Slide 6 and beginning with Palmarejo. Higher gold grades and uptick in mill throughput led to a nice finish to the year. Full year gold and silver production came in on the high end of guidance range and CAS for gold and silver finished closer to the high end of guidance as Palmarejo fought inflationary headwinds all year round. Despite these challenges, the team delivered nearly $46 million of free cash flow in 2022. Looking ahead, guidance for 2023 anticipates a similar year in terms of gold production, while silver production guidance is significantly higher. Despite continued easing in certain of Palmarejo's input costs, our 2023 cost guidance reflects caution as overall costs remain volatile. Moving to Rochester. The 30-plus percent increases we saw in gold and silver production in the fourth quarter were driven by significantly higher grades due to the mine sequencing placed on pad 4 in September and October that began to break through in the latter half of the quarter. This surge in grades made the difference in helping Rochester exceed its gold production guidance for the year and come in at the high end of its silver production gains. Fourth quarter adjusted CAS for silver and gold on a core product basis were down versus the previous quarter due to high attributable metal sales. We have elected to defer providing 2023 cost guidance at Rochester until midyear given the transitional nature of the year ahead. There will be a lot of moving parts as we start placing crushed ore on Stage VI leach pad on February 1. We turned on the Merrill-Crowe plant during Q2 2023, and we began placing rock through the new crushing circuit later in the summer. The number of (inaudible) visible in the POA 11 photo slides demonstrate clearly that construction is at peak levels on the crushing corridor. The work is proceeding. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Steel erection and equipment installation is proceeding on both the cone crushers in the secondary crusher area as well as both the HPGR crushers in the tertiary crusher area. Slide 12 in the presentation highlights the progress on our key milestones for 2023 at POA 11. The Merrill-Crowe process plant remains on track for completion at the end of the first half of 2023, in line with the P85 schedule. Mechanical equipment setting, process plant building cladding, control systems programming and factory testing are all now complete. Electrical cable and piping installation are well underway. I'm also pleased to report that the construction project has now passed 1.5 million hours as of January 31 without a lost time incident. Turning to Kensington. Once again, a great job by the team to reach a new all-time record in mill throughput. New leadership there continues to make a strong mark and bodes well for the future of this key asset. Challenging recoveries through most of 2022 led Kensington to just missing the low end of the production guidance. 2023 guidance reflects similar levels of production and cost. With the previously discussed infusion of capital at Kensington, this year will be a busy period of development to set the mine up for a strong future. Finishing briefly with Wharf. The team overcame some significant snowfalls in the quarter to finish within expectations near the high end of its 2022 guidance range. 2023 guidance reflects a return to more typical gold production rates with CAS ranges, setting the stage for stronger anticipated cash flow in the year ahead. With that, I'll pass the call over to Tom.Thomas S. WhelanThanks, Mick. Turning to Slide 4. I'll begin with a review of our consolidated financial results before touching on our 2023 guidance and the balance sheet. As expected, Coeur's improved fourth quarter financial results were driven by our highest gold production of the year and the $62 million gain on sale from Sterling Crown. Higher prices, along with gains from our gold hedges, led to a 96% increase in our EBITDA quarter-over-quarter. Speaking of hedging, our 2022 program provided $24 million of net gains, $13 million of which was realized in the fourth quarter. Subsequent to year-end, we took advantage of some short-term momentum in gold and silver prices to add additional downside price protection for 2023. Inflation remains a headwind on our sector's financial performance. While we have seen some moderation in diesel prices, Slide 5 demonstrates the continued pressure on our key cost buckets. Accordingly, our 2023 outlook continues to assume a challenging year for operating costs. I am pleased to report that Coeur's capital cost exposure at POA 11 continued to decrease with approximately $605 million of the estimated capital now committed and $495 million incurred. As Mitch and Mick both mentioned, the project remains on track and on budget with approximately 75% of the remaining CapEx expected to be incurred during the first half of the year. Turning to 2023 guidance. Our guidance remains consistent with our December 2022 Investor Day as we approach the free cash flow inflection point post completion of POA 11. Mitch and Mick have already hit on the key messages around production, operating costs, POA 11 capital and the tale of 2 halves this year. I want to highlight a couple of additional very important items within the guidance, which we expect will deliver NAV growth and reduce overall risk for the company. We have allocated value-accretive capital for additional underground mine development and exploration at Kensington and Palmarejo, which is expected to extend mine lives and reduce risk at both mines. To accommodate these extended mine lives, both sites are investing in new tailings capacity during 2023. Obtaining that crucial POA 1 permit amendment at Kensington last year has allowed us to progress on the aggressive multiyear program at the mine, which includes this permitted tailings capacity. At Palmarejo, the new tailings capacity will be inside the old open pit, which is a significant environmental derisking milestone. Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 16 provides a good snapshot of our financial position, featuring total potential liquidity of over $500 million. We do, however, remain concerned in the short term about the overall macro environment for gold and silver prices and continued operating cost inflation. This concern, coupled with our tale of 2 halves of 2023, has led us to take several actions to keep our balance sheet flexible during the final few months of capital intensity at Rochester. The key elements of our financing strategy include: we recently monetized our remaining position in Victoria Gold for $40 million; our revolving credit facility, which has $280 million of capacity; our hedging program designed to provide downside commodity price risk protection during this period of capital intensity. We head into 2023 with approximately 180,000 ounces of gold hedged at $1,961 per ounce and 3.2 million ounces of silver hedged at $24.55 per ounce. And we put a new ATM in place for gross potential proceeds of up to $100 million. These key initiatives taken to enhance our total potential liquidity leave us feeling comfortable that the balance sheet will provide the required flexibility to deliver the industry-leading high-return growth that will transform our company. I'll now turn it over to Aoife.Aoife Mairead McGrathThanks, Tom. As Mitch said earlier, successful exploration in 2022 led to an increase in our global reserves with growth at each site. Looking at a few key highlights. At Kensington, the multiyear exploration plan described in our December Investor Day is already bearing fruit with reserves increasing by an impressive 56%. The majority of this growth came from Upper Kensington Zones 30, 30A and 30B. These zones remain open, and we will continue to expand and infill drill these areas through 2023. In addition to Kensington, we saw a resource and reserve additions at Elmira. And this deposit, along with the Johnson deposit, show opportunities for growth in 2023 and beyond. Detailed geological modeling is increasing our understanding of all deposits in Kensington, and we are hopeful that this will help us vector to both higher grades and new zones. At our high-grade Silvertip exploration project, we also saw notable growth with silver, lead and zinc measured and indicated resources increasing by 73%, 69% and 81%, respectively, year-over-year. 2022 was an exciting year for exploration with the following notable achievements. Firstly, expansion drilling increased mineralization at the Southern Silver Zone to approximately 500 meters vertical extent and 1,800 meters along strike as shown on Slide 10. Mineralization was also intersected in multiple stratigraphic units, thereby increasing the amount of the stratigraphic column that is amenable to mineralization. This opens up significantly more opportunity for stacked mantos and multiple chimneys. Secondly, the discovery of new chimney structures beneath the Discovery manto zone, and thirdly, scout drilling in the Saddle zone generates new chimney targets for follow-up in 2023. We believe Silvertip has good potential to be a long-life mine. And right now, we have visibility on how to build a sufficient reserve base to enable a decision to proceed once the economics are sufficiently compelling. We see the continued growth at Silvertip as opportunity to expand Coeur's future global production, reduce costs and boost free cash flow. I will now pass the call back to Mitch.Mitchell J. KrebsThanks, Aoife. Before moving to the Q&amp;A, I want to highlight Slide 17 that summarizes our clear priorities for 2023. As I mentioned at the outset, execution remains front and center in this pivotal year. By successfully delivering on these objectives, we plan to reach the end of 2023 on the cusp of a new growth phase for the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research Partners.Michael Stephan DudasI know 2023 couldn't consume enough, Mitch. Regarding Rochester, what's the hurdle? Or what's the pinch point you guys are seeing over the next few months that gives the marketplace confidence that your targets on construction, completion and the ramp will occur within what you guys are talking about today?Mitchell J. KrebsYes. Good question. This is the -- it's a busy year with a lot of moving parts out there, all of this coming together here now with the first half focused on the Stage VI leach pad, which is now complete. We're stacking ore on that. Merrill-Crowe comes next in the second quarter, crusher mid-summer, and then we start putting rock through it and ramping it up throughout the second half of the year. Mick, do you want to give a little bit of detail on some of the other moving parts that are going on there throughout the year?Michael RoutledgeYes, yes, exactly. So we completed stacking ore on pad 4 and moved across the pad 6 on schedule. That was a great achievement, milestone on February 1. And then now we'll continue to leach pad 4, so we'll see some metal from that throughout the first half of the year, but we're stocking now and building up inventory on pad 6 right through to that middle of the year when we expect to commission the heap leach on the Merrill-Crowe, and then we'll start seeing that metal come out of inventory in the second half of the year as per the plan. From a project perspective, we're still on the P85 project schedule and went through the normal challenging Nevada winter around continuing to stay on track. We're still on that track. And from a manpower and loading perspective for the project, TIC and Kiewit had done a fantastic job at reloading and covering any attrition on that project, and we are fully manned up to get the rest of the project done throughout the year.Mitchell J. KrebsJust to add on to that, Mike. The conversation around here has started to transition quite noticeably less about construction activities and schedule and more about operational readiness plans around the ramp-up schedule and everything that needs to go into ensuring that this thing ramps up smoothly throughout the back half of the year to deliver on that second half production growth and set us up for what should be that inflection point in cash flow as we head into 2024. So it's -- there's been a noticeable shift in terms of what the -- where the priorities are and where the new focus areas are out there now. So that's exciting to see.Michael Stephan DudasThat's very encouraging, Mitch. My follow-up is you just discussed on Silvertip some pretty positive results. Any changes in thoughts from Investor Day to how you're thinking about the project today, timing or structure, recognizing job 1 is getting Rochester done?Mitchell J. KrebsYes. You said it right there. Job 1 in 2023 is POA 11 execution. The priorities at Silvertip this year really are twofold, minimizing the holding cost as we prioritize POA 11 and continuing to expand the resource up there, which we have a lot of confidence in. We've seen it grow significantly since we acquired it. And even year-over-year, Aoife mentioned the percentage growth in the different metals just year-over-year. We have a lot of confidence that, that will continue. It will be a bit of a smaller program this year compared to last year, targeting a little bit more on the expansion side to step out a bit more with the thought being that as we do that, and we have a lot of confidence that we can, that's just going to help us put together a compelling business case in a few more years that will justify the capital that would go into expanding and starting that up as another operation. But -- so the priority for now is to keep growing the resource, which Aoife, I think, has some confidence in. And a couple of things you want to maybe say about that, Aoife?Aoife Mairead McGrathYes. I mean we had a great year in 2022 up there at Silvertip. We really -- our understanding of the deposits really developed. Southern Silver Zone itself is becoming quite an important part of this story at the moment. So we've extended mineralization there over a vertical extent of 500 meters and the along strike extent to date still open is 1,800 meters. So that in itself is opening up that Southern Silver Zone as a very -- as something that can add significantly to the tons there. And it's a vertical orebody. It's a chimney. So it's potentially an easier mining scenario for us as well. In addition to that, we did some scout holes under the Discovery Zone, which to date has been a manto horizon, more so a sub-horizontal zone. And we found some new chimneys under that, which we'll follow up on this year.

KrebsSo Mike, just to pull the lens back then, POA 11 this year, back to positive free cash flow, lower cost, reduced debt, keep expanding that resource at Silvertip in the meantime, get to a point where we have an attractive business case at Silvertip, at which point then we can have some options to think about whether we'd go it alone, whether we'd bring in a partner or whether that's a strategic partner or a financial partner, operating JV, nonoperating JV. But we need that compelling business case to get to that point, and drilling is the way to get there. And so that's the kind of the progression and priorities as we sit here today.Operator(Operator Instructions) There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session.

It will also stop making soda ash, as well as cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, two building blocks in the production of artificial fabrics, paints, and varnishes.BASF’s fuel bill rose by €3.2B last year as the company was forced to scramble for alternative sources of gas at unprecedented prices. At Ludwigshafen alone, BASF ended up paying €1.4B more for gas in 2022 than in 2021, even though it cut its consumption by 35%.The group had already warned that the spike in energy prices had badly hurt the global competitiveness of its sites in Germany. These had profited for years from cheap and reliable natural gas from Russia which it used both as a fuel and a feedstock for its organic chemistry operations.The group's net loss was much larger than the group had flagged in January, due in part to its decision to write off the Russian assets of its upstream Wintershall Dea subsidiary costing it €6.5B. Some €4.7B of that hit the fourth-quarter income statement.Earnings before interest and taxes all but dried up in the fourth quarter, falling 90% to €119 million. Revenue fell 2.3%, as a 15% fall in sales volumes was partly offset by a 9.2% increase in average prices. The results were also flattered by a 4.5% tailwind from foreign exchange, reflecting the euro’s weakness against the dollar.Story continuesFor the current year, BASF said it expects sales to fall about 2% to a range around €85.5B, while earnings before interest and taxes are set to fall by more than 20% to some €5.1B.The group was also a shareholder in the consortiums that built the two Nord Stream gas pipelines, which were destroyed last summer after Russia unilaterally halted supplies of gas to Germany in an effort to pressure Europe into accepting its aims in Ukraine.Despite the writedowns, the company kept its dividend proposal at €3.40 a share. That didn’t stop the stock price from falling 6.9% by 04:30 ET (09:30 GMT) to its lowest since early January.Related ArticlesBASF slumps after massive writedowns in Russia trigger €4.8 billion lossHigher provisions, legal charges dampen CIBC's quarterly profitU.S. FDA approves Sanofi's bleeding disorder therapy]"

European stocks fell 1.04%.""The fact we've got another data item that shows the economy is not slowing enough to hopefully give the Fed confidence that they're in front of the inflation problem - that's why the market is down,"" said Robert Stimpson, portfolio manager at Oak Associates Funds in Akron, Ohio.On Wall Street all three major indexes posted their biggest weekly drop of 2023, led by a selloff of stocks in so-called cyclical sectors including technology, communication services, consumer discretionary, and even healthcare.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.02% to 32,816.92, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.05% to 3,970.04 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.69% to 11,394.94.U.S. Treasury yields jumped, with benchmark 10-year yields hitting 3.9452%, and two-year yields, which are highly sensitive to Federal Reserve policy, rising as high as 4.8156%, the highest since Nov. 4.""The risk to the market is that it was premature in its anticipation of a Fed pivot. The Fed is going to continue raising interest rates higher than people think and for longer than people think,"" Stimpson added.Story continuesOil prices edged higher in volatile trade, bolstered by the prospect of lower Russian exports but pressured by rising inventories in the United States and concerns over global economic activity.Brent crude futures settled at $83.16 a barrel, up 1.2%. West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures (WTI) settled at $76.32 a barrel, rising 1.2%.The U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies, with the dollar index up 0.65% at a seven-week high and the euro down 0.48% at $1.0544.Gold prices dropped to their lowest levels in eight weeks, pushed down by the stronger dollar and higher bond yields. Spot gold dropped 0.6% to $1,810.97 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures fell 0.47% to $1,810.20 an ounce.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Matthew Lewis)]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, NRG Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while PSEG has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that NRG likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PEG has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.60, while PEG has a forward P/E of 17.74. We also note that NRG has a PEG ratio of 6. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PEG currently has a PEG ratio of 7.52.Another notable valuation metric for NRG is its P/B ratio of 2. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PEG has a P/B of 2.29.Based on these metrics and many more, NRG holds a Value grade of B, while PEG has a Value grade of F.Story continuesNRG is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that NRG is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NEE) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by insider Armando Pimentel, who spent a stonking US$996k on stock at an average price of US$75.44. Not only is that a big swing, but it increased their holding size by 11%, which is definitely great to see. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Armando Pimentel was the biggest purchase of NextEra Energy shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$72.87). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months NextEra Energy insiders were buying shares, but not selling.

Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At NextEra Energy Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases.

More homebuilders have reported quarterly earnings and now some of the big renovation retailers, like Home Depot, have also done the same.Housing froze at the end of last year as mortgage rates jumped over 7%. But with rates down to 6% in 2023, traffic to the new construction sales centers rose. The homebuilders reported improvement in volumes for the first 4 to 6 weeks of 2023.But now mortgage rates are back near 7% again. Have buyers moved to the sidelines once again?Investing in Housing Industry StocksThe homebuilders have been on a tear the last 3 to 6 months on the “hope” trade. The “hope” trade is when the investor is “hoping” that the spring season is going to be good so they buy the stocks ahead of time. Homebuilder stocks often rise in the months leading up to the spring season as a result.But investors could also be looking at furniture and home remodeling, which are also tied in to home buying.

More homebuilders have reported quarterly earnings and now some of the big renovation retailers, like Home Depot, have also done the same.Housing froze at the end of last year as mortgage rates jumped over 7%. But with rates down to 6% in 2023, traffic to the new construction sales centers rose. The homebuilders reported improvement in volumes for the first 4 to 6 weeks of 2023.But now mortgage rates are back near 7% again. Have buyers moved to the sidelines once again?Investing in Housing Industry StocksThe homebuilders have been on a tear the last 3 to 6 months on the “hope” trade. The “hope” trade is when the investor is “hoping” that the spring season is going to be good so they buy the stocks ahead of time. Homebuilder stocks often rise in the months leading up to the spring season as a result.But investors could also be looking at furniture and home remodeling, which are also tied in to home buying. These were hot stocks during the pandemic. But is the consumer tapped out as inflationary pressures rise?5 Stocks in the Housing Industry: Buy or Not? 1.      Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. TPHTri Pointe Homes had a tough fourth quarter. It saw net orders fall 69% to 444 from 1424 in the year ago period thanks to higher mortgage rates.

The tally would also be up more than 6% compared to January volumes. February 2023 U.S. auto sales are estimated to translate to an estimated sales pace of 14.4 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate: SAAR), a marked decline from the month-prior figure, although the underlying sales rate, as represented by the daily selling rate metric, should advance mildly.Light Vehicle Sales Comparisons, S&amp;P Global Mobility, February 2023""Auto demand levels so far this year have sustained the trends converging in the market at the end of 2022,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Perhaps notably, fleet sales as a portion of total monthly volume have escalated over the past few months. While this could be an additional signal that auto consumers continue to face an uncertain purchase environment, fleet improvements are not unexpected, as auto production and inventory levels continues to advance.""Regarding the auto production environment, ""While demand destruction concerns remain pervasive, production levels are well underway, which should improve vehicle availability by mid-2023,"" said Joe Langley, associate director of research and analysis for S&amp;P Global Mobility's North American Light Vehicle Forecasting &amp; Analysis team. ""Greatly improved vehicle availability may in turn stimulate demand as incentive levels are expected to increase.""The S&amp;P Global Mobility auto outlook for 2023 continues to carry a countercyclical narrative: We expect production levels will continue to improve even as economic conditions are worsening through the early stages of the year. Together with improving production volumes, reports of sustained retail orders, recovering vehicle inventory, and more fleet demand we should see improvements even with worries of an economic recession. S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts calendar-year 2023 sales volume of 14.8 million units, a 7% increase from the 2022 tally.Story continuesU.S. Light Vehicle SalesFeb 23 (Est)Jan 23Feb 22Total Light VehicleUnits, NSA1,098,0001,033,0001,045,624In millions, SAAR14.415.713.7Light TruckIn millions, SAAR11.512.610.9Passenger CarIn millions, SAAR2.93.12.8Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility (Est), U.S. Bureau of Economic AnalysisSustained development of battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales remains a constant assumption for 2023. The Tesla and Ford price adjustments should continue to boost the monthly BEV share to record levels, as reports reflect that the downward price movement for its products has boosted demand. BEV share in February is estimated to reach 8.0%, continuing the momentum realized in January. Whether these pricing adjustments will be matched by the likes of Hyundai, Kia, and Volkswagen and become a BEV price war, the reaction of other auto companies will determine whether the gains in the BEV mix level will be a blip or a tipping point in the electrification progress of the market.About S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

For more food companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Stocks. The food industry is one of the most crucial sectors in the world, and one that is also often thought of as a harbor against recession. The reasoning for this argues that during an economic downturn, while consumers will reduce their luxury spending, and put off buying an iPhone for example, they still have to buy food. Additionally, the food industry is also one of the largest in the world since it does not have to worry about creating demand and instead has to think of innovative ways to manage demand and out compete rivals in business processes such as logistics and supply chain management.Taking a look at the monetary estimates of the industry, a research report from Fortune Business Insights spells out the sheer scale of the sector. Zoning in on the food processing market, it points out that the sector was worth a whopping $2.3 trillion in 2021, and adds that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% to be worth an estimated $5.1 trillion by 2029.The sector's strength is evidenced by this CAGR, as trillion dollar industries generally do not have growth rates that end up exceeding 5%. The research firm outlines that the market growth will be supported by several trends, such as the growth in vegetarian diets, the surge in migration to cities, an increase in online ordering, and higher disposable incomes to spend on dining out.Today, we will take a look at some of the most profitable food companies in the world, and some of them are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Nestlé S.A. (OTCMKTS:NSRGY).Most Profitable Food StocksOur Methodology In order to pick out the top players in terms of profitability in the food industry, we started by picking out the top fifty companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Then, their net income for the past twelve months was sifted out, following which the top 13 companies were selected and included in this piece.Story continuesMost Profitable Food Stocks13. The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY)Trailing Twelve Month Net Income: $1.64 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders in Q4 2022: 37 The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) is one of the more well known American food companies that is famous primarily for its chocolates. The firm also sells baking ingredients, toppings, and other food products.

The index is expected to be up 0.4% from a month earlier, compared with 0.3% the previous month.Story continuesClose Brothers Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer, Robert Alster, said markets were upbeat about the strength of consumer spending in many of the major economies at the moment but also wary about inflation staying higher for longer and extending the rise in interest rates.""That is why were are all hanging on each data point,"" Alster said. ""There is a feeling it is going to be volatile, a bit like being cautiously optimistic skating on thin ice"" he added. ""We are virtually neutral now on all asset classes.""UNWELCOME ANNIVERSARYWall Street was pointing lower again having ended a topsy-turvy Thursday in positive territory for the first time in five sessions, although it too remains on course for its worst week of the year.The expectations that U.S. interest rates might need to rise for longer meant the dollar index, which measures the top world currency against six of its main peers, was up 0.25% at a seven-week high of 104.859. On Thursday, an unexpected fall in new claims for unemployment and a revised uptick in the fourth-quarter PCE price index, suggested some lasting strength in the world's largest economy.""The U.S. dollar index should extend its rise towards 106 if today's U.S. PCE deflators lift the US Treasury 2Y yield above the 4.5-4.75% Fed Funds Rate range,"" said analysts at DBS Bank.A year on from Russia sending its troops into Ukraine, the focus remained the loss of life and long-term geopolitical implications, although the spillovers of the war have had a major impact on financial markets.Aaron Dunn, co-head of value equity at Eaton Vance, said the most obvious had been the sharp increase in oil and gas and agricultural prices when the war broke out. Notably though, most of those moves have been completely reversed.""You have basically retracted a fair amount of the gains in most of the energy markets in the back half of 2022,"" Dunn said, highlighting that the slump in natural gas prices following a mild winter meant gas use was now replacing coal again in Europe.""That has helped the global economic picture,"" he explained. ""The big question is now the top line, the economic performance, and in that respect China's reopening will play an outsized role in the direction we go from here.""The overnight comments from BOJ head-elect Ueda on Japan's easy-money policy had seen Japan's Nikkei share index close up 1.3%, while its five-year government bond yield eased to 0.235%.Ten-year Japanese bonds didn't trade on Friday due to thin liquidly, after breaching the upper limit of the BOJ's policy cap for two straight days. But the yen turned choppy as data also showed core consumer inflation hitting a 41-year high, keeping pressure on the BOJ to phase out its stimulus programme.Meantime, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3%, for a hefty weekly drop of 2.5%.In particular, Chinese blue chips tumbled 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 1.6% after comments from U.S. officials that Washington would increase the number of troops helping train Taiwan's forces.In the bond markets, the key Treasury yield, or the cost for the U.S. government to borrow in the international debt markets, eased to as far as 3.8590% before climbing back to 3.9101%.Benchmark European yields flip-flopped too, dipping after Germany, the bloc's industrial power-house, said its economy shrank by slightly more than initially predicted in the fourth quarter of 2022.They popped up again ahead of U.S. trading though with Germany's 10-year government bond yield last up at 2.49% having hit a 2011 high earlier in the week after stronger-than-expected euro zone PMI data.In the oil market, Brent crude futures rose 0.8% to $82.84 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was also up 0.8% at $75.99.Gold was fractionally higher at a spot price of $1,824.89 per ounce although it was on course for a fourth straight weekly drop.(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Robert Birsel and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

And thanks to Europe's mild winter, brimming storage and gas substitution, yearend natural gas prices are back to where they were 11 months ago - down more than 31% so far in 2023.But it's the pickup and stickiness in underlying ""core"" prices, excluding energy and food, that is irking the central banks and the Federal Reserve most of all.And if the world economy is gathering some steam again in 2023, as recent numbers suggest, interest rate policy may have to be a lot harsher than everyone has assumed.Alongside another tight U.S. weekly jobs report, markets got another glimpse of those price pressures on Thursday.The Commerce Department showed inflation increased much faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter of last year, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure that the Fed favours accelerating at a 4.3% pace compared with prior estimate of 3.9%.The revisions to prices were led by used and new motor vehicles and fees for nonprofit hospital services.Friday gets a more updated monthly view of core PCE from January and it's not yet clear if quarterly revisions affect the standing consensus forecast for an easing of the rate to 4.3% from 4.4% in December - still more than twice the Fed's target.Markets are now braced for three more quarter-point rate hikes from the Fed to at least 5.25%-5.50%, with no cut fully priced from there by yearend. At 4.71% on Friday, two-year Treasury yields are close to cycle highs.Story continuesAlthough cheered on Thursday by chip designer Nvidia's blowout earnings and upbeat outlook, S&amp;P500 stock futures are back in the red - barely clinging to the pivotal 4,000 point level.And increasingly buoyed by the still intense geopolitical fallout from a year of the war in Ukraine, the dollar pushed higher yet again.Whether China now backs Moscow militarily as well as rhetorically is seen as one of the biggest global questions surrounding the war 12 months on and would mark critical juncture in Western relations with Beijing too - and in trade globalisation more generally.China's offshore yuan fell to its lowest level of the year against the dollar on Friday.The dollar also rose against Japan's yen on Friday, with the Nikkei's 1% gain bucking the dour weekend mood elsewhere, after comments by the incoming Bank of Japan chief.Even though data showed Japan's core consumer inflation hitting a fresh 41-year high in January, Kazuo Ueda insisted the BOJ must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the fragile economy, warning of the dangers of responding to cost-driven inflation with monetary tightening.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. January personal income and spending, PCE inflation indices, January new home sales; Kansas City Fed February service sector survey * Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, Fed Board Governor Philip Jefferson, Boston Fed chief Susan Collins speak. Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro speaks * Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida chairs G7 leaders meeting.

153,eddc36ee-b33e-3773-adbf-382d83bc0fb9,MA,2023-02-24,"GRAPHIC-One year of war in Europe: How the dollar, energy and food prices swirled",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-one-war-europe-dollar-093644481.html,1677231404,STORY,['NG=F'],"[LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted economies and markets around the world, from energy and food prices to European banks, emerging market stocks and the Russian currency.Below are five charts that show how Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two has shaped global financial markets in the last 12 months.1/THE SAFEST OF SAFE HAVENSThere are many reasons why king dollar reigned supreme in the past year and one is its status as the ultimate safe haven at times of uncertainty. The economic fallout of the war, which hit currencies such as the euro hard, also lifted the dollar.The greenback is down from September's two-decade highs, but it's still up 8% against a basket of currencies since the conflict began.The impact on other safe havens such as governments bonds is complicated, however. Yes, U.S. and European bond prices rose in the days following Russia's invasion as investors sought safety in top quality assets.But they soon fell and yields soared as the war triggered an energy shock and inflation surged, while central banks responded with aggressive rate hikes. Germany's 10-year Bund yield has risen to 2.4% from just 0.2% on Feb. 23, 2022..2/THE STING IN THE PIPELINEThe war in Ukraine brought with it an energy crisis like no other. Post-COVID-19 reopening had already sent prices for anything from oil to coal to natural gas higher. But when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in late February, European natural gas prices rocketed by almost 400% in two weeks. By August, they were 700% higher than a year earlier.Pre-war, Russia supplied over 30% of Europe's gas, most of it through a network of pipelines, thousands of kilometres long. Once Western sanctions hit, the flows of gas dried up. Energy prices soared, bringing the threat of blackouts, recession and a worrying switch back to dirtier sources of fuel.Thankfully, winter has proven mild and Europe has found other suppliers, bringing the gas price back to around 50 MWh, its lowest since August 2021. But, there's a lag of around 6-9 months between what happens on the wholesale market and what happens to consumers' bills, meaning last August's punishing spike to almost 350 MWh - equivalent to an oil price of over $200 a barrel - hasn't even begun to bite.Story continues3/PRECIOUS FOODFood prices, which were already on a tear in 2021 after COVID-19, leaped again after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on fears of shortages and disruptions to Black Sea trade.Last year the U.N. food agency's average price index hit its highest level on record, up 14.3% from the previous year. The index had already gained 28% in 2021.Higher energy and input costs, adverse weather and continued strong global food demand are adding to pressure from significant market disruptions. Over the whole of 2022, four of the five food sub-indexes - cereals, meat, dairy and vegetable oils - reached record highs.Food price pressures are easing, but that does little to soften the blow for many developing nations, where food and energy prices make up a larger share of spending. Shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine mean the world is unlikely to meet a longstanding goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030, the World Bank has warned.4/ ROUBLE TROUBLEThe past year has seen wild swings for Russia's currency - a more than 50% tumble following the invasion to record lows in March, followed by a more than 200% rise to a multi-year high in June thanks to soaring energy prices, FX restrictions and the central bank ramping up interest rates. Twelve months on, the rouble is broadly back to its pre-war 12-month average.Russia wants a weaker rouble to boost hydrocarbon revenues, which is helping plug a widening budget deficit and soaring domestic spending due to the ballooning cost of the Ukraine war. But it is also attempting to shore up its finances by selling its foreign currency reserves, and started interventions for the first time in almost a year in January. Moscow burned through $38 billion of its rainy-day fund, the National Wealth Fund, in December alone to cover its deficit.Fresh pressure on the currency could come from sanctions: EU members are expected to approve a 10th package around the anniversary.5/TWO CAMPS FOR EU BANKSEuropean banks took a drubbing when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, those that have slashed links have outperformed and those that have not continue to see their shares take a hit.Raiffeisen Bank International's shares suffered their worst daily drop since the onset of the war on Monday, as the Austrian lender drew the attention of U.S. sanctions officials over its Russian business. Shares of Raiffeisen, deeply embedded in Russia's financial system, have slumped over 40% since the start of 2022.France's Societe Generale sold its Russia business Rosbank in May, taking a 3 billion euro ($3.18 billion) hit. Italy's UniCredit cut its cross-border exposure to Russia by two thirds, but still owns one of Russia's top 15 lenders. It has pledged to cut its presence, which has reassured investors.

Krebs; President, CEO &amp; Director; Coeur Mining, Inc.Thomas S. Whelan; Senior VP &amp; CFO; Coeur Mining, Inc.Michael Stephan Dudas; Partner; Vertical Research Partners, LLCPresentationOperatorGood day, and welcome to the Coeur Mining Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mitchell Krebs, President and CEO. Please go ahead.Mitchell J. KrebsGood morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and 2022 earnings call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary language on forward-looking statements in today's slide deck and refer to our SEC filings on our website. I'll start with the main highlights on Slide 3 before turning the call over to Mick, Tom and Aoife. The fourth quarter was Coeur's strongest quarter of the year, which helped to achieve our overall full year production guidance for the third consecutive year, definitely not an easy task last year with such unprecedented volatility. Rochester was the main driver to our solid finish last year. Both silver and gold production increased over 30% quarter-over-quarter with sharply lower costs. Ongoing operational enhancements and higher grades contributed to Rochester's results as we begin the transition to the newly expanded infrastructure, where construction remains on track to be completed midyear. We achieved several critical objectives last year that we believe are important value drivers for the company in the short, medium and long term. In the short term, we continued to derisk and advance the Rochester expansion. The project is nearing 80% complete this month and remains on track in terms of budget and schedule. We also further fortified the balance sheet to support our elevated levels of investment in our existing assets that are intended to increase production, decrease costs, extend mine lives and drive a return to positive free cash flow, which Tom will provide more details on in a few minutes. In the medium term, the team at Kensington got an early jump on their multiyear development and drilling program last year by adding approximately 1.5 years to its mine life. As we laid out during our Investor Day in December, we're optimistic about further extending Kensington's mine life and generating solid returns from higher production and lower costs from this investment. Over the longer term, I want to highlight the great results from yesterday's reserve and resource update on Slide 11, which reflects another year of successfully replacing mine reserves. Year-over-year, our gold reserves increased by roughly 12%, while silver reserves increased approximately 3%. Over the past 5 years, we have invested roughly $245 million in exploration during a time when many companies have underinvested in this critical component of the business. Over that time, our gold equivalent reserves have expanded by 2 million ounces or roughly 34% net of depletion. In addition, our gold equivalent resources have increased nearly 4 million ounces or approximately 80%. Aoife will provide some additional comments on our exploration successes and our year-end reserve and resource results in a few minutes. Just a few quick thoughts as we look ahead to 2023. Overall, the key for us this year is obviously execution, not only at Rochester with the completion of construction and ramp-up post expansion, but across the entire portfolio to achieve our objectives that can transition the company back to positive free cash flow. We anticipate 2023 will be comprised of 2 very different halves. During the first half, capital intensity is expected to remain high while we experience weaker seasonal operating results from our 2 open pit operations. The first half also includes our normal first quarter outflows relating to 2022 tax, interest and compensation-driven payments. During the second half of the year, capital intensity is expected to sharply decline, and production levels are expected to increase as we begin the commissioning and ramp-up process at Rochester. Overall, 2023 production is expected to increase over last year, driven by Rochester's stronger second half and by an expected strong bounce-back year at Wharf after a lower-grade year in 2022. To quickly wrap up, we remain confident in the key pillars of what we think is a unique strategy in our sector and exclusively North American and U.S.-centric footprint, a contrarian multiyear commitment to exploration that continues to generate meaningful results, investments in expansions that are designed to deliver sector-leading growth and have transformative impacts on the business and a metals mix that offers meaningful and growing exposure to silver. An unrelenting focus by our team on executing this strategy is bringing us closer and closer to that point of transformation that everyone has been working so hard for. With that, I'll turn it over to Mick.Story continuesMichael RoutledgeThanks, Mitch. I'll start by echoing Mitch's comments on the great job our teams have done this last year to deliver guidance amid challenging circumstances. With the right people in the right chairs executing the right strategy, we feel confident in our ability to consistently deliver significant long-term value. Our journey to zero harm progressed well in 2022 with the teams delivering the best environmental health and safety performance in the history of the company. What a fantastic achievement to be proud of, but that journey is not over as we continue to control exposures as we drive to get to 0 as quickly and sustainably as possible. Turning to a brief recap of our fourth quarter production summary on Slide 6 and beginning with Palmarejo. Higher gold grades and uptick in mill throughput led to a nice finish to the year. Full year gold and silver production came in on the high end of guidance range and CAS for gold and silver finished closer to the high end of guidance as Palmarejo fought inflationary headwinds all year round. Despite these challenges, the team delivered nearly $46 million of free cash flow in 2022. Looking ahead, guidance for 2023 anticipates a similar year in terms of gold production, while silver production guidance is significantly higher. Despite continued easing in certain of Palmarejo's input costs, our 2023 cost guidance reflects caution as overall costs remain volatile. Moving to Rochester. The 30-plus percent increases we saw in gold and silver production in the fourth quarter were driven by significantly higher grades due to the mine sequencing placed on pad 4 in September and October that began to break through in the latter half of the quarter. This surge in grades made the difference in helping Rochester exceed its gold production guidance for the year and come in at the high end of its silver production gains. Fourth quarter adjusted CAS for silver and gold on a core product basis were down versus the previous quarter due to high attributable metal sales. We have elected to defer providing 2023 cost guidance at Rochester until midyear given the transitional nature of the year ahead. There will be a lot of moving parts as we start placing crushed ore on Stage VI leach pad on February 1. We turned on the Merrill-Crowe plant during Q2 2023, and we began placing rock through the new crushing circuit later in the summer. The number of (inaudible) visible in the POA 11 photo slides demonstrate clearly that construction is at peak levels on the crushing corridor. The work is proceeding. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Steel erection and equipment installation is proceeding on both the cone crushers in the secondary crusher area as well as both the HPGR crushers in the tertiary crusher area. Slide 12 in the presentation highlights the progress on our key milestones for 2023 at POA 11. The Merrill-Crowe process plant remains on track for completion at the end of the first half of 2023, in line with the P85 schedule. Mechanical equipment setting, process plant building cladding, control systems programming and factory testing are all now complete. Electrical cable and piping installation are well underway. I'm also pleased to report that the construction project has now passed 1.5 million hours as of January 31 without a lost time incident. Turning to Kensington. Once again, a great job by the team to reach a new all-time record in mill throughput. New leadership there continues to make a strong mark and bodes well for the future of this key asset. Challenging recoveries through most of 2022 led Kensington to just missing the low end of the production guidance. 2023 guidance reflects similar levels of production and cost. With the previously discussed infusion of capital at Kensington, this year will be a busy period of development to set the mine up for a strong future. Finishing briefly with Wharf. The team overcame some significant snowfalls in the quarter to finish within expectations near the high end of its 2022 guidance range. 2023 guidance reflects a return to more typical gold production rates with CAS ranges, setting the stage for stronger anticipated cash flow in the year ahead. With that, I'll pass the call over to Tom.Thomas S. WhelanThanks, Mick. Turning to Slide 4. I'll begin with a review of our consolidated financial results before touching on our 2023 guidance and the balance sheet. As expected, Coeur's improved fourth quarter financial results were driven by our highest gold production of the year and the $62 million gain on sale from Sterling Crown. Higher prices, along with gains from our gold hedges, led to a 96% increase in our EBITDA quarter-over-quarter. Speaking of hedging, our 2022 program provided $24 million of net gains, $13 million of which was realized in the fourth quarter. Subsequent to year-end, we took advantage of some short-term momentum in gold and silver prices to add additional downside price protection for 2023. Inflation remains a headwind on our sector's financial performance. While we have seen some moderation in diesel prices, Slide 5 demonstrates the continued pressure on our key cost buckets. Accordingly, our 2023 outlook continues to assume a challenging year for operating costs. I am pleased to report that Coeur's capital cost exposure at POA 11 continued to decrease with approximately $605 million of the estimated capital now committed and $495 million incurred. As Mitch and Mick both mentioned, the project remains on track and on budget with approximately 75% of the remaining CapEx expected to be incurred during the first half of the year. Turning to 2023 guidance. Our guidance remains consistent with our December 2022 Investor Day as we approach the free cash flow inflection point post completion of POA 11. Mitch and Mick have already hit on the key messages around production, operating costs, POA 11 capital and the tale of 2 halves this year. I want to highlight a couple of additional very important items within the guidance, which we expect will deliver NAV growth and reduce overall risk for the company. We have allocated value-accretive capital for additional underground mine development and exploration at Kensington and Palmarejo, which is expected to extend mine lives and reduce risk at both mines. To accommodate these extended mine lives, both sites are investing in new tailings capacity during 2023. Obtaining that crucial POA 1 permit amendment at Kensington last year has allowed us to progress on the aggressive multiyear program at the mine, which includes this permitted tailings capacity. At Palmarejo, the new tailings capacity will be inside the old open pit, which is a significant environmental derisking milestone. Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 16 provides a good snapshot of our financial position, featuring total potential liquidity of over $500 million. We do, however, remain concerned in the short term about the overall macro environment for gold and silver prices and continued operating cost inflation. This concern, coupled with our tale of 2 halves of 2023, has led us to take several actions to keep our balance sheet flexible during the final few months of capital intensity at Rochester. The key elements of our financing strategy include: we recently monetized our remaining position in Victoria Gold for $40 million; our revolving credit facility, which has $280 million of capacity; our hedging program designed to provide downside commodity price risk protection during this period of capital intensity. We head into 2023 with approximately 180,000 ounces of gold hedged at $1,961 per ounce and 3.2 million ounces of silver hedged at $24.55 per ounce. And we put a new ATM in place for gross potential proceeds of up to $100 million. These key initiatives taken to enhance our total potential liquidity leave us feeling comfortable that the balance sheet will provide the required flexibility to deliver the industry-leading high-return growth that will transform our company. I'll now turn it over to Aoife.Aoife Mairead McGrathThanks, Tom. As Mitch said earlier, successful exploration in 2022 led to an increase in our global reserves with growth at each site. Looking at a few key highlights. At Kensington, the multiyear exploration plan described in our December Investor Day is already bearing fruit with reserves increasing by an impressive 56%. The majority of this growth came from Upper Kensington Zones 30, 30A and 30B. These zones remain open, and we will continue to expand and infill drill these areas through 2023. In addition to Kensington, we saw a resource and reserve additions at Elmira. And this deposit, along with the Johnson deposit, show opportunities for growth in 2023 and beyond. Detailed geological modeling is increasing our understanding of all deposits in Kensington, and we are hopeful that this will help us vector to both higher grades and new zones. At our high-grade Silvertip exploration project, we also saw notable growth with silver, lead and zinc measured and indicated resources increasing by 73%, 69% and 81%, respectively, year-over-year. 2022 was an exciting year for exploration with the following notable achievements. Firstly, expansion drilling increased mineralization at the Southern Silver Zone to approximately 500 meters vertical extent and 1,800 meters along strike as shown on Slide 10. Mineralization was also intersected in multiple stratigraphic units, thereby increasing the amount of the stratigraphic column that is amenable to mineralization. This opens up significantly more opportunity for stacked mantos and multiple chimneys. Secondly, the discovery of new chimney structures beneath the Discovery manto zone, and thirdly, scout drilling in the Saddle zone generates new chimney targets for follow-up in 2023. We believe Silvertip has good potential to be a long-life mine. And right now, we have visibility on how to build a sufficient reserve base to enable a decision to proceed once the economics are sufficiently compelling. We see the continued growth at Silvertip as opportunity to expand Coeur's future global production, reduce costs and boost free cash flow. I will now pass the call back to Mitch.Mitchell J. KrebsThanks, Aoife. Before moving to the Q&amp;A, I want to highlight Slide 17 that summarizes our clear priorities for 2023. As I mentioned at the outset, execution remains front and center in this pivotal year. By successfully delivering on these objectives, we plan to reach the end of 2023 on the cusp of a new growth phase for the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research Partners.Michael Stephan DudasI know 2023 couldn't consume enough, Mitch. Regarding Rochester, what's the hurdle? Or what's the pinch point you guys are seeing over the next few months that gives the marketplace confidence that your targets on construction, completion and the ramp will occur within what you guys are talking about today?Mitchell J. KrebsYes. Good question. This is the -- it's a busy year with a lot of moving parts out there, all of this coming together here now with the first half focused on the Stage VI leach pad, which is now complete. We're stacking ore on that. Merrill-Crowe comes next in the second quarter, crusher mid-summer, and then we start putting rock through it and ramping it up throughout the second half of the year. Mick, do you want to give a little bit of detail on some of the other moving parts that are going on there throughout the year?Michael RoutledgeYes, yes, exactly. So we completed stacking ore on pad 4 and moved across the pad 6 on schedule. That was a great achievement, milestone on February 1. And then now we'll continue to leach pad 4, so we'll see some metal from that throughout the first half of the year, but we're stocking now and building up inventory on pad 6 right through to that middle of the year when we expect to commission the heap leach on the Merrill-Crowe, and then we'll start seeing that metal come out of inventory in the second half of the year as per the plan. From a project perspective, we're still on the P85 project schedule and went through the normal challenging Nevada winter around continuing to stay on track. We're still on that track. And from a manpower and loading perspective for the project, TIC and Kiewit had done a fantastic job at reloading and covering any attrition on that project, and we are fully manned up to get the rest of the project done throughout the year.Mitchell J. KrebsJust to add on to that, Mike. The conversation around here has started to transition quite noticeably less about construction activities and schedule and more about operational readiness plans around the ramp-up schedule and everything that needs to go into ensuring that this thing ramps up smoothly throughout the back half of the year to deliver on that second half production growth and set us up for what should be that inflection point in cash flow as we head into 2024. So it's -- there's been a noticeable shift in terms of what the -- where the priorities are and where the new focus areas are out there now. So that's exciting to see.Michael Stephan DudasThat's very encouraging, Mitch. My follow-up is you just discussed on Silvertip some pretty positive results. Any changes in thoughts from Investor Day to how you're thinking about the project today, timing or structure, recognizing job 1 is getting Rochester done?Mitchell J. KrebsYes. You said it right there. Job 1 in 2023 is POA 11 execution. The priorities at Silvertip this year really are twofold, minimizing the holding cost as we prioritize POA 11 and continuing to expand the resource up there, which we have a lot of confidence in. We've seen it grow significantly since we acquired it. And even year-over-year, Aoife mentioned the percentage growth in the different metals just year-over-year. We have a lot of confidence that, that will continue. It will be a bit of a smaller program this year compared to last year, targeting a little bit more on the expansion side to step out a bit more with the thought being that as we do that, and we have a lot of confidence that we can, that's just going to help us put together a compelling business case in a few more years that will justify the capital that would go into expanding and starting that up as another operation. But -- so the priority for now is to keep growing the resource, which Aoife, I think, has some confidence in. And a couple of things you want to maybe say about that, Aoife?Aoife Mairead McGrathYes. I mean we had a great year in 2022 up there at Silvertip. We really -- our understanding of the deposits really developed. Southern Silver Zone itself is becoming quite an important part of this story at the moment. So we've extended mineralization there over a vertical extent of 500 meters and the along strike extent to date still open is 1,800 meters. So that in itself is opening up that Southern Silver Zone as a very -- as something that can add significantly to the tons there. And it's a vertical orebody. It's a chimney. So it's potentially an easier mining scenario for us as well. In addition to that, we did some scout holes under the Discovery Zone, which to date has been a manto horizon, more so a sub-horizontal zone. And we found some new chimneys under that, which we'll follow up on this year. And also down to the South, all the way down to Tour Ridge, we are scheduling over the last few years intersection mineralization, and that's another few kilometers of extent that we can expand into.Mitchell J. KrebsSo Mike, just to pull the lens back then, POA 11 this year, back to positive free cash flow, lower cost, reduced debt, keep expanding that resource at Silvertip in the meantime, get to a point where we have an attractive business case at Silvertip, at which point then we can have some options to think about whether we'd go it alone, whether we'd bring in a partner or whether that's a strategic partner or a financial partner, operating JV, nonoperating JV. But we need that compelling business case to get to that point, and drilling is the way to get there. And so that's the kind of the progression and priorities as we sit here today.Operator(Operator Instructions) There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mitchell Krebs for any closing remarks.Mitchell J. KrebsOkay. Well, hey, we appreciate everybody's time today during this busy reporting period, and we look forward to talking with you all after the first quarter in the springtime. Thanks again, and have a good day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase QUALCOMM's shares before the 1st of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, QUALCOMM has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current stock price of $126.2. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether QUALCOMM has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately QUALCOMM's payout ratio is modest, at just 28% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether QUALCOMM generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 41% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see QUALCOMM's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 45% per annum for the past five years. QUALCOMM is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. QUALCOMM has delivered an average of 12% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs QUALCOMM worth buying for its dividend? We love that QUALCOMM is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. QUALCOMM looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

""The CHIPS and Science Act presents us with an opportunity to make investments that are similarly consequential for our nation’s future.”Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductors at the White House in September. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Raimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.The speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works— and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.""Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,"" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America’s national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.Story continuesIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law ""the most significant competition policy in our generation."" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.The overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the “premier destination in the world” for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that “every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.”'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'The Biden administration’s challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.The situation is even worse with the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.Raimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. ""That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,"" she said.President Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Raimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.“Our success will be short-lived"" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&amp;D is what will make it a longer term success.""It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,"" she said.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added ""as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.""The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Return on investment? National security. Raimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.She noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy’s 1961 call—and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The next step in the administration’s plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo’s department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. “It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,” Raimondo told reporters.The speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.""I expect to be held accountable,"" Raimondo said.Meanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.Raimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.""Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,"" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country. ""I don't want to spend a dime that I don't have to.""This post has been updated.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Lockheed due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Lockheed Q4 Earnings Top Estimates, Sales Rise Y/YLockheed Martin reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $7.79 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.41 by 5.1%. The bottom line also improved 7.9% year over year.The company reported GAAP earnings of $7.40 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $7.47 in the prior-year quarter.For the full-year 2022, the company reported adjusted earnings of $27.23 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.70 by 25.5%. GAAP earnings for the full-year 2022 came in at $21.66 compared with $22.76 in 2021.Our model projected adjusted earnings of $7.25 per share for the fourth quarter and $26.88 per share for 2022.Operational HighlightsIn the reported quarter, net sales amounted to $19 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.25 billion by 4.1%. The top line rose 7.3% from the $17.7 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.For the full-year 2022, net sales came in at $66 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $65.24 billion by 1.2%. However, net sales declined 1.5% year over year.Our model projected net sales of $18.26 billion for the fourth quarter and $65.25 billion for 2022.BacklogLockheed Martin ended 2022 (on Dec 31, 2022) with $149.99 billion in the backlog compared with $135.36 billion at the end of 2021. Of this, the Aeronautics segment accounted for $56.63 billion, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $34.95 billion.Meanwhile, Space Systems and the Missiles and Fire Control segments contributed $29.68 billion and $28.74 billion, respectively.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceAeronautics:Sales improved 7% year over year to $7.64 billion, primarily driven by higher sales from the F-35 program, the C-130 program and classified contracts. The segment’s operating profit decreased 0.5% year over year to $816 million. The operating margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 10.7%.Missiles and Fire Control:Quarterly sales rose 2% year over year to $3.29 billion due to higher sales from tactical and strike missile programs. The segment’s operating profit increased 2.9% year over year to $451 million, while the operating margin expanded 10 bps to 13.7%.Space Systems:Sales increased 12% year over year to $3.27 billion in the fourth quarter due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, national security space programs and commercial civil space programs. The segment’s operating profit decreased 25% to $231 million. The operating margin contracted 340 bps to 7.1% in the quarter under review.Rotary and Mission Systems:Quarterly revenues increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $4.80 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales for integrated warfare systems and sensors programs, Sikorsky helicopter programs and the Combat Rescue Helicopter program.The segment’s operating profit rose 13.4% to $508 million in the fourth quarter. The operating margin expanded 60 bps to 10.6% in the reported quarter.Financial ConditionLockheed Martin’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.55 billion at the end of 2022 compared with $3.60 billion at the end of 2021. Cash from operating activities at the end of 2022 amounted to $7.80 billion compared with $9.22 billion a year ago.GuidanceLockheed Martin initiated its financial guidance for 2023. The company expects 2023 revenues in the range of $65-66 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues, which is pegged at $65.72 billion, is in line with the midpoint of the company’s guided range.Earnings per share are anticipated in the band of $26.60-$26.90 for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s full-year earnings of $27.38 per share is higher than the midpoint of LMT’s guidance range. Also, the company expects its free cash flow guidance to be approximately $6.2 billion for 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Lockheed has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, Lockheed has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

160,2a01862d-7899-397e-935d-57f5f68322e4,LMT,2023-02-24,U.S. weapons sales to get stricter human rights review under Biden,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-weapons-sales-stricter-human-140000471.html,1677160800,STORY,"['RTX', 'LMT']","[By Patricia ZengerleWASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration unveiled on Thursday a long-awaited overhaul of arms export policy with increased emphasis on human rights, backing off a Trump-era policy of giving more weight to commercial concerns.As Reuters reported on Wednesday, the new Commercial Arms Transfer (CAT) policy covers review of security assistance, government-to-government weapons transfers and licensed commercial sales of U.S.-origin military equipment and services overseen by the State Department as well as the Defense and Commerce departments, including firearms commonly available in the United States.Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances commercial interests of exporters like Lockheed Martin Co and Raytheon Technologies against the country's stated commitment to human rights.One change is how the CAT policy addresses the possibility that arms from the United States could be used for major human rights violations, State Department officials said.Under the new policy, a weapons transfer will not be approved if the State Department assesses the arms ""more likely than not"" will be used to commit or facilitate genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva conventions, or serious violations of international law.Previous CAT policy had said such transfers would not be authorized only when Washington had ""actual knowledge"" that the arms would be used in such actions.""We are looking at a policy of prevention when there is a risk of violation of human rights,"" one official said. The policy also allows deals to be canceled if rights violations are documented after they are announced.The officials declined to specify countries or past deals that the new policy might affect.RHETORIC VS. RIGHTS REALITYAdvocates have long questioned weapons sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the civilian toll of the war in Yemen. Biden's administration was criticized last year for approving the potential sale of radars and aircraft to Egypt despite what Human Rights Watch called Egypt's ""atrocious human rights record.""Story continues""Unfortunately, the Biden administration has a mixed record on these issues so far,"" William Hartung, senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said in an emailed statement, adding that the administration ""will have to change course if they are going to live up to the rhetoric of the new policy.""The change could also affect exports of smaller weapons such as assault rifles that can be used against domestic populations. Some of this has been under the aegis of the Commerce Department since the administration of former Republican President Donald Trump.The new CAT policy has been in development for months. Reuters reported in 2021 that the Biden administration was considering a CAT policy shift to emphasize human rights.The United States is by far the world's biggest arms merchant, selling some $150 billion in weapons, services and training a year.The U.S. Arms Export Control Act requires Congress to be notified of major foreign defense sales agreements, and an informal review process allows the Democratic and Republican leaders of foreign affairs committees to vet such agreements.Lawmakers often raise rights concerns. For example, Senator Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opposes the sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 aircraft to Turkey for reasons including disregard for human rights.Trump viewed weapons deals as a way to generate U.S. jobs. He rolled out a CAT policy in 2018 that gave commercial concerns as much weight as human rights in deciding whether to approve weapons sales.

164,5b89a4cf-472c-306c-8252-d60f03df0a6e,JNJ,2023-02-24,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Down 6.9% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-jnj-down-6-163004801.html,1677169804,STORY,['JNJ'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ). Shares have lost about 6.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Johnson &amp; Johnson due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Q4 Earnings Beat, Sales Miss, 2023 EPS View UpbeatJ&amp;J’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings came in at $2.35 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.22 as well as our estimate of $2.21 per share. Earnings rose 10.3% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings exclude intangible amortization and some other special items. Including these items, J&amp;J reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.33 per share, down 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.Sales came in at $23.71 billion, slightly missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.72 billion. Sales declined 4.4% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 0.9% and a negative currency impact of 5.3%. Excluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide.Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 0.8% on an operational basis compared with an 8.2% increase in the previous quarter.Fourth-quarter sales in the domestic market rose 2.9% to $12.52 billion. International sales declined 11.5% on a reported basis to $11.19 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 1.1%, plus a negative currency impact of 10.4%. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an adjusted operational basis, international sales declined 1% in the quarter.Overall, macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-related impacts hurt fourth-quarter sales growth While the Pharmaceuticals unit continued to post above-market adjusted operational sales growth, sales slowed down in the fourth quarter. COVID resurgence in China and supply constraints hurt sales in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments.Story continuesSegment DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales declined 7.4% year over year to $13.16 billion, reflecting a 2.5% operational decline and a 4.9% negative currency impact. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales declined 2.3%. Pharmaceutical segment sales exceeded our estimates of $12.8 billion as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.04 billion.Sales in the domestic market declined 0.6% to $7.38 billion. International sales declined 14.9% to $5.79 billion (operational decline of 4.5%).Higher sales of key products, such as Darzalex and Stelara as well as relatively newer drugs, Erleada and Tremfya was offset by lower sales of J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. The sales growth was also dampened by lower sales of key medicine, Imbruvica and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.Darzalex sales rose 26.6% year over year to $2.08 billion in the quarter, which missed our estimates of $2.11 billion.Stelara sales grew 2.3% to $2.39 billion in the quarter. driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as favorable prior period adjustment. Sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the United States as well as austerity measures in Europe and unfavorable shipment timing in Asia Pacific. Stelara sales missed our estimate of $2.45 billion. While J&amp;J expects Stelara volumes to increase till the loss of exclusivity in late 2023, the growth is expected to be hurt by pricing pressure as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe.Imbruvica sales declined 18.5% to $866 million due to increased competitive pressure in the United States from novel oral agents and below pre-COVID levels in the CLL market in the United States. Imbruvica sales beat our estimates of $849.7 million.Among the newer medicines, Erleada generated sales of $541 million in the quarter, up 40.9% year over year. Tremfya recorded sales of $752 million in the quarter, up 8.5% year over year driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications, partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment.PAH revenues of $870 million rose 2.3% year over year. Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza/Trevicta sales declined 2% to $1.0 billion in the quarter. Simponi/Simponi Aria sales declined 10.2% to $501 million, while Prezista sales decreased 4.3% to $493 million.  Xarelto sales rose 3.4% in the quarter to $667 million, while sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 24.1% to $91.0 million.Zytiga sales declined 50.8% to $270 million in the quarter, predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. Sales of Remicade were down 37.8% in the quarter to $475 million.J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine generated sales of $689 million in the fourth quarter, down 57.4% year over year. International sales accounted for all COVID-19 vaccine sales.Excluding COVID-19 vaccine, sales in the Pharmaceutical segment declined 1% as an operational increase of 3.9% was offset by a negative currency movement of 4.9%. In the first half of the year, the loss of exclusivity of products like Zytiga and Invega Sustenna in Europe as well as continued pricing pressure is expected to put pressure on the top line. The ramp up of new products is expected to be stronger in the second half of the year.J&amp;J continues to expect its Pharmaceutical business to deliver market-leading adjusted operational sales growth in 2023 despite the Stelara loss of exclusivity in the second half in the United States.The MedTech segment sales came in at $6.78 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 4.9% was offset by a negative currency movement of 6.1%. The MedTech segment sales missed our estimate of $7.06 billion as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.97 billion.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 4.4%.Sales in the MedTech segment were driven by a recovery in surgical procedures, better commercial execution and new product launches. However, sales were partly hurt by volume-based procurement (VBP) issues and COVID resurgence in China and as well as supply constraints.Interventional Solutions grew 7.8% driven by new products and continued growth of electrophysiology products. In Surgery, Advanced Surgery declined 7.0% worldwide. General Surgery declined 3.5% worldwide. Worldwide orthopedics declined 0.4%.  Worldwide Vision declined 2.2%.Domestic market sales rose 7.1% year over year to $3.45 billion. International market sales declined 8.6% year over year to $3.33 billion, which included an operational increase of 2.9% and a negative currency impact of 11.5%.In the MedTech segment, J&amp;J expects continued recovery in worldwide procedure volumes and uptake from recently launched products to drive sales in 2023. However, the lingering headwinds from hospital staffing will be the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery. In China, J&amp;J expects continued pressure in 2023 due to lingering effects of the pandemic and the impact of the VBP program.In the MedTech segment, second-half operational sales growth is expected to be higher than the first half of the year as the ongoing procedure recovery is expected to improve as the year progresses. Some of the COVID seen in China in the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to carry over into early 2023. The uptake of new product launches is expected to be more pronounced in the second half.The Consumer Health segment recorded revenues of $3.77 billion in the reported quarter, up 1% year over year, reflecting a 6.4% operational increase and a 5.4% negative currency impact. Consumer Health segment sales came ahead of our estimate of $3.70 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.73 billion.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 6.4%.The sales growth was driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and higher sales in Neutrogena due to market growth and new product launches in Asia Pacific and Latin America. This growth was partially offset by supply constraints in the United States (due to raw material availability and labor shortages), COVID-19 impacts in China and sales suspension of personal care products in Russia.Sales in the domestic market rose 10.9% from the year-ago period to $1.7 billion. The international segment declined 5.8% to $2.07 billion, which included an operational increase of 3.2% and a negative currency impact of 9.0%.In the Consumer segment, J&amp;J expects continued growth in markets and strategic price increases to benefit results in 2023 although some challenges like inflationary pressure within the supply chain and higher input costs are expected to continue. Second-half sales are expected to be stronger than the first half.2022 ResultsFull-year 2022 sales rose 1.3% to $94.94 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.99 billion. Sales beat the guided range of $93.0 billion to $93.5 billion.Adjusted earnings for 2022 were $10.15 per share, up 3.6% year over year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.04 per share as well as the guided range of $10.02-$10.07 per share.Issues 2023 GuidanceThe company’s profit outlook for 2023 was above analyst expectations while the sales outlook was below estimates.J&amp;J expects to generate revenues in the range of $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance excludes any revenues from J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine. The guidance range fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $98.18 billion. Revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5% – 5.5%.Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, operational constant-currency sales are expected to increase in the range of 4.5%-5.5%. The adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth guidance is 3.5%-4.5%.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $10.45 – $10.65. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.22 per share.The earnings range indicates an increase of 3. On an operational, constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 2.5%-4.5%.J&amp;J does not expect any impact from currency headwinds on reported sales for the year as a potential negative impact in the first half of the year is likely to be offset by a likely favorable impact in the second half.Adjusted pretax operating margins are expected to be flat from 2022 levels as the impact of continued operating expense leverage will be offset by the impact of inflationary pressure. J&amp;J expects supply constraints, inflationary pressure and rising input costs to continue to hurt margins in 2023. Operating margin is expected to be better in the second half than the first.Other income is expected to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Adjusted tax rate guidance was maintained in the range of 15.5 % to 16.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Johnson &amp; Johnson has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Welcome to Minnesota where signs of spring are in the air. I appreciate that you are joining us today for Medtronic's Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I will share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 27, 2023 as well as our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us.And we will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors to cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our Q1 acquisition of Intersect ENT. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the second quarter of fiscal 23 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.Story continuesWith that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.Geoff Martha: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We reported our Q3 results this morning and we executed to deliver a top and a bottom line that were ahead of our guidance and Street expectations. We are urgently forging the path to durable growth and there are many proof points of our progress in these results. Our cardiovascular and our neuroscience portfolios had strong high single-digit organic growth as we launch new products and demonstrated continued strength in our established market leading cardiac rhythm management and spine franchises. And at the same time, some of the recent revenue headwinds that have held back our growth are subsiding, including product availability in businesses like surgical innovations, cardiac diagnostics, aortic and ENT.The aggressive transformation at Medtronic is advancing. We are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our culture, improving capital allocation and portfolio management and upgrading our global manufacturing operations and supply chain capabilities. At the same time, we are progressing on our plans for significant cost reductions. These are aimed at partially mitigating the continued impacts from macro conditions such as inflation and effects on our profitability and cash flow. These cost reductions also create room on our P&amp;L so that we can increase our growth investments and I am very encouraged by the rebound in our revenue growth despite procedure volumes remaining a little softer in a few markets and volume-based procurement in China.We are confident in delivering durable revenue growth over the coming quarters as recent revenue headwinds continue to dissipate and we execute across our businesses. So, let's take a closer look at our Q3 results. As I highlighted at an investor conference last month, we are thinking about our portfolio of businesses in three groups: highest growth, synergistic and established market leaders. So I will start with our established market leaders, a group of our largest businesses that make up about half of our revenue. Both our cardiac rhythm and spine businesses had really good quarters, growing 8% and 5% respectively. In CRM, we continue to see strong market adoption of our micro-leadless pacemakers, which grew 14% and our Defibrillation Solutions business grew 7% as replacement headwinds are moderating.And just last week, we received CE Mark for our Aurora Extravascular ICD. In Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies, we delivered another strong quarter, with 6% growth in Core Spine, including 12% growth in the United States and 8% growth in Neurosurgery. This is driven by our market leading ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of our best-in-class spinal implants. From our AI-enabled surgical planning platform to our patient-specific and differentiated spine implants, to our imaging our navigation and robotic technologies, we are differentiating ourselves with spine surgeons around the world. Turning to our Surgical Innovations business, SI grew sequentially as we made solid progress recapturing the share that we lost due to supply challenges over the last three quarters.Year-over-year, SI declined as a result of expected stapling VBP tenders in China. But excluding China sales, SI grew 5% in Q3. Look, surgeons around the world prefer our advanced surgical products and we expect the momentum we are seeing in SI to continue. In particular, in our leading advanced energy franchise, we are seeing strong adoption of our recently launched cordless Sonicision 7 and we are preparing to launch our recently approved LigaSure XP. So we are on the right path with our established market leader businesses. And at the same time, we are advancing our position in high secular growth med tech markets. These businesses are contributing about 20% of our revenue today and collectively growing above our company average. We are investing disproportionately in these businesses and expect them to become an even bigger part of our growth over time.So starting with Structural Heart, while the TAVR market continued to be impacted by healthcare staffing challenges and COVID in Japan, we drove 11% growth in Q3, including 12% growth in the United States. We are seeing great physician reception for our Evolut FX system, which just completed its full quarter of launch in the U.S. Evolut FX combines industry leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. And in addition, data was presented during the quarter at PCR London Valves, showing Evolut FX's Commissure alignment has improved significantly, which is important for coronary access and valve hemodynamics. Now looking ahead, we will continue to bring Evolut FX around the world and we are currently seeking approval in the Japanese and European markets.In cardiac ablation solutions, we grew 3% globally as provincial China VBP tenders weighed on our results. Outside of China, CAS grew in the high single-digits, including low double-digit growth in the United States on the continued strong adoption of our leading Arctic Front cryoablation technology. We are also advancing what we believe will become the leading pulsed field ablation portfolio. And in 2 weeks, highly anticipated data for our PULSED AF pivotal trial will be released in the late-breaker session at ACC. The trial is evaluating our PULSE Select PFA catheter in both paroxysmal and persistent patients and this will be the first results from an IDE trial in the PFA space and we are on track to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the U.S. market.We also continue to make progress on bringing our Affera mapping and navigation platform and Sphere-9 catheter to the market as we completed enrollment in our pivotal trial during the quarter. Sphere-9 can perform high-density mapping and deliver either PFA or RF energy, all from the same catheter. And given Sphere-9 is a focal point PFA catheter, it is highly complementary to our PULSE Select anatomical PFA catheter. Finally, our CAS business just launched the AcQCross transseptal access system with a zero exchange workflow and the only system approved for both mechanical and RF crossings. So when you think about our Arctic Front crysolution, our DiamondTemp RF catheter, our PFA catheters, our left heart access solutions and our Affera map nav system, we are assembling a leading ecosystem of technologies to meaningfully increase our participation in the fast growth 8 billion EP ablation space.In Surgical Robotics, we are making good progress as the second major player in this exciting space. We continue to see positive sales momentum with the rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets and we started our U.S. IDE trial for our urology indication during the quarter. Given less than 5% of surgical procedures globally are done robotically, we expect our surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic. In Neurovascular, we grew 9% and would have grown a couple of points more, if not for the China VBP. We continue to see very strong growth in several categories, including flow diversion, aspiration and stent retrievers. Given stroke is the number two cause of death globally and there is still very low therapy penetration, we see a long runway for high growth in this market that is approaching $4 billion.And in Diabetes, we continue to see strong international growth offset by declines in the U.S. where we lack our latest products. We remain focused on resolving our FDA warning letter and are ready for reinspection. We also remain in active review with the FDA on our submission of the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor. Outside the U.S., our Diabetes business grew 18% on continued strong sales momentum of 780G and Guardian 4. The 780G is now launched in over 90 countries, up from 60 last quarter. We are seeing strong CGM attachment rates, which drove CGM growth up 34% outside the U.S. We continue to invest heavily in assembling our ecosystem of durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, algorithms and customer service with multiple programs under development, all with the intent of restoring strong growth of our important diabetes franchise over the coming years.And in our synergistic businesses, we also had strong performances across several businesses. We grew double-digits in Cardiac Diagnostics as we ramped up production of LINQ II. In Neuromodulation, we grew 12% in pain stim and the market continues to recover. And our GI business grew high single digits on strong adoption of GI Genius, which uses artificial intelligence to help physicians detect polyps during colonoscopies. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our third quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen?Karen Parkhill: Thank you, Geoff. Our third quarter organic revenue increased 4.1%, exceeding our guidance and representing a significant acceleration from our first half results as we begin to put the acute supply chain challenges behind us. Our non-GAAP EPS of $1.30 landed above our guidance by $0.03 on higher revenue growth and increased interest income, and $0.06 if we take into account a larger currency headwind than expected at the beginning of the quarter. Looking at our revenue from a geographic perspective, U.S. grew 2%, and our non-U.S. developed markets increased 6%, even with a 3% decline in Japan as COVID affected procedure volumes. Excluding Japan, non-U.S. developed markets increased 8%. Emerging markets grew 5%, impacted by an 8% decline in China from COVID and VBP provincial tenders in stapling, cardiac ablation and neurovascular.Outside of China, emerging markets actually grew 17%. I would also note that China represented a 110 basis point headwind on our total company growth, which highlights the strength of the recovery in our other markets. VBP has affected us more than many of our competitors, given the size and breadth of our business in China. However, we do expect that we are now through the majority of the impact. Our adjusted gross margin declined in the quarter as we faced impacts from inflation and currency with currency driving about third of the change. These declines were expected and a result of inflationary pressures that occurred two to three quarters ago. Our incurred manufacturing variances have continued to be significant in the past few quarters.And as they roll off our balance sheet on to our P&amp;L, we expect continued gross margin pressure in Q4 and next year. The gross margin impact translated into a decline in our adjusted operating margin as well, although this was partially muted by expense control and the benefit of our currency hedging program. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to execute our enhanced capital allocation and portfolio management work, balancing future growth investments with returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, primarily in the form of our dividend. We see strong opportunities for organic growth investments internally, leading us to target R&amp;D growth at or above revenue growth. And we continue to focus on supplementing our organic investments with tuck-in acquisitions.We've also announced this fiscal year three businesses we intend to separate that account for about 8% of our revenue. And we're making progress towards completing those transactions. We expect to close our Renal Care joint venture with DaVita here in the fourth quarter, and continue to progress with the separation of our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses, which we expect to occur sometime in the second half of next fiscal year. We have also closed on acquisitions that will contribute to our growth in the years ahead, including Affera, which expands our presence in cardiac ablation, and Intersect ENT, which adds unique sinus implants to our ENT portfolio. We have driven these moves to not only focus and streamline our portfolio, but also to improve our weighted average market growth rate over time.Now turning to our guidance. Given our top and bottom line beat in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue growth and EPS outlook. On the top line, we expect our fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%, which is unchanged from what was implied by our second half guidance that I gave last quarter. I would note that our organic growth guidance excludes the impact of currency and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. And it also now excludes revenue from our Renal Care Solutions business as we expect the separation to occur during the fourth quarter. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue of $165 million to $215 million. Taking into account currency, Intersect ENT revenue and the partial quarter of Renal Care Solutions revenue, our guidance would imply reported revenue in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion.We are also maintaining the fourth quarter revenue growth segment expectations that were implied by the back half guidance I gave last quarter. We continue to expect Cardiovascular to be up 5.5% to 6%, Medical Surgical to grow 2.5% to 3%, neuroscience to increase 6.5% to 7% and Diabetes to decline in the low single digits, all on an organic basis. On the bottom line, we continue to drive significant expense reductions to partially offset the impact of inflation and foreign currency. Given our third quarter $0.03 beat, we raised the lower end of our fiscal 23 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to the new range of $5.28 to $5.30, including an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.21 at recent rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.57.At recent rates, FX is about a $0.09 headwind to fourth quarter EPS. While we won't give guidance this fiscal year until our fourth quarter call in May, I did give some color on last quarter's call, and we will remind you of it today. We're encouraged by our recent progress on revenue growth. At the same time, current macro factors and our imperative to protect R&amp;D investment are expected to create significant EPS headwinds next fiscal year. At recent rates, FX is a few hundred million dollar tailwind to fiscal 24 revenue and an approximate $0.27 headwind to EPS, which translates to a 5% headwind to EPS growth. While inflationary pressures are starting to moderate, we still see significant mid-single-digit inflationary impacts on our cost of goods sold as wage and raw material price increases continue to roll off our balance sheet and into our P&amp;L.We are working to partially mitigate these headwinds through significant cost reductions. But both inflation and currency and to a lesser extent, interest and tax, are all looking to be headwinds that reduce our earnings power in fiscal 24. I would summarize by saying that as we navigate this period of increased macro headwinds, we will be driving disciplined cost reduction, and we are committed to investing in our future growth drivers and our turnaround as we firmly believe these important investments are necessary to drive durable revenue growth and long-term value creation. Before I hand it back to Geoff, I want to take a moment to thank the thousands of employees across Medtronic who delivered this quarter. You are executing with excellence and accountability, leveraging our scale with differentiating capabilities and managing our resources to accelerate innovation.It is because of your efforts that we will create a durable growth company powered by our people as we continue our mission-driven work of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. Back to you, Geoff.national-cancer-institute--Ln-tYivJM4-unsplashGeoff Martha: Thank you, Karen. Now before we open the lines for questions, I'll make a few closing remarks. Last quarter, I noted that our aggressive agenda to transform this company would take time, and that's still true. But I hope you'll take away that we are operating with a high sense of urgency, which you can see reflected in our results this quarter. We're reducing our complexity, enhancing our capabilities and augmenting our management team with new leaders that bring an outside diverse perspective. We're also exercising decisive capital allocation and portfolio management devoting more capital to high-growth opportunities and divesting non-core assets. There is an intense focus from me, our Board, our management and our employees to create a company with sustainable growth that you can count on.We're in attractive markets with growing populations globally that can benefit from our therapies. And we fully expect to deliver durable revenue growth and turn our scale into a long-term competitive advantage. And through this process, create tremendous value for our shareholders. Now let's move to Q&amp;A. We're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?See also Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks and Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Merck and Ridgeback will appeal the decision and request a re-examination of the CHMP’s opinion.""We believe the CHMP’s recommendation does not reflect the compelling data generated from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial and from real-world studies demonstrating the positive impact that LAGEVRIO can provide for patients by reducing the risk of hospitalization and death among adults at increased risk for severe disease,"" said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. ""More than 4 million patients worldwide have been treated with LAGEVRIO. We remain confident that LAGEVRIO has an important role to play in the COVID‑19 treatment landscape and will appeal this opinion.""""LAGEVRIO is prescribed globally as an important medicine for appropriate adult patients at risk for severe disease, and there is a critical need for multiple approaches to treat COVID-19,"" said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.The EMA scientific opinion under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, which has supported the decision by 16 EU national authorities to make LAGEVRIO available, remains in effect.LAGEVRIO is approved or authorized for use in more than 25 countries, including Australia, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China for the treatment of certain adults who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. LAGEVRIO has been used in more than 4 million patients worldwide, and recent real-world studies – conducted across different geographies during the Omicron variant surge and as availability of effective vaccines has increased – support the clinical profile of LAGEVRIO as a treatment option for certain adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for severe disease.Story continuesAbout Merck’s Global Efforts to Accelerate Access to LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) Following Regulatory Authorizations or ApprovalsGlobal access has been a priority for Merck and Ridgeback since the inception of their collaboration. The companies are committed to providing timely access to LAGEVRIO globally through our comprehensive supply and access approach, which included investing at risk to produce millions of courses of therapy; tiered pricing based on the ability of governments to finance health care; entering into supply agreements with governments; and granting voluntary licenses to generic manufacturers and to the Medicines Patent Pool to make generic molnupiravir available in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following local regulatory authorizations or approvals. To supplement the supply from licensed generic manufacturers and bridge to the availability of WHO prequalified generic supply, Merck entered into agreements with UNICEF and USAID to allocate up to a total of 5 million courses of LAGEVRIO to low- and middle-income countries.Authorized Use of LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) in the U.S.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an EUA for the emergency use of the unapproved product LAGEVRIO, a nucleoside analogue that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by viral mutagenesis, for the treatment of adults with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. LAGEVRIO is not FDA-approved for any use, including the treatment of COVID-19.The emergency use of LAGEVRIO is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1) unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with LAGEVRIO has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. LAGEVRIO may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which LAGEVRIO belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).Selected Safety Information for LAGEVRIOContraindicationsNo contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO authorized under this EUA.Warnings and PrecautionsThere are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use.LAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.LAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of the pregnancy registry at https://covid-pr.pregistry.com or 1-800-616-3791. Pregnant individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO or their healthcare providers can also report the exposure by contacting Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA at 1-877-888-4231.Advise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose.Prior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated.Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO have not been established in pediatric patients.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of subjects in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).Serious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (&lt;1%) of the subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.Drug InteractionsNo drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of LAGEVRIO with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted.Pregnancy/BreastfeedingThere are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from LAGEVRIO, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of LAGEVRIO.Males of Reproductive PotentialNonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for LAGEVRIO to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO. The risk beyond three months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO is unknown.Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication ErrorsThe prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to LAGEVRIO within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.Submit adverse event and medication error reports, using FDA Form 3500, to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:Complete and submit the report online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 (https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download) and return by:Mail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, orFax to 1-800-FDA-0178 orCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting formIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA by: Fax: 215-616-5677 E-mail: dpoc.usa@merck.comAbout LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir)LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) (MK-4482) is an investigational, orally administered nucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID‑19.Merck and Ridgeback’s ""orange COVID-19 pill"" is a Swedish Orange opaque capsule with the Merck corporate logo and ""82"" printed in white ink, available in certain markets as LAGEVRIO.Molnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. LAGEVRIO is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of LAGEVRIO have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback.LAGEVRIO was evaluated in MOVe-OUT, a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally in more than 170 sites in locations including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. For further information about the MOVe-OUT trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov.LAGEVRIO is being studied in other diseases beyond coronaviruses. Early work on additional programs has begun, and a study evaluating LAGEVRIO for RSV (NCT05559905) is recruiting participants.About Ridgeback BiotherapeuticsHeadquartered in Miami, Florida, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP is a biotechnology company focused on emerging infectious diseases.

All four members of Congress are Democrats.They expressed particular concern over Merck's efforts to patent a subcutaneous version of the currently infused drug, which Reuters reported on late last year.They wrote that Merck’s use of dozens of patents to fend off Keytruda competitors ""appear(s) to be an example of the anti-competitive business practices ... that we have long been concerned about.""Merck in a statement said it is ""continuously innovating to enhance the benefits of Keytruda in order to reach greater numbers of patients and to increase efficacy and convenience of the treatment.""""When appropriate, Merck protects this additional innovation through the filing of patent applications, particularly when we view the innovation as novel, useful and non-obvious,"" a Merck spokesperson said by email.Merck, which reported $20.9 billion in 2022 sales of Keytruda, has relied on the immunotherapy to fuel its growth.The treatment, first approved in 2014, harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancers with dramatic results. Against advanced lung cancer, it has led to a five-year survival rate in about one-quarter of people compared to 5% historically for the disease.Story continuesIt initially demonstrated impressive survival benefits in the deadliest form of skin cancer and has since been approved for many types of cancer.The members of Congress wrote that subcutaneous injections do not represent novel improvements for drugs, as ""medications have been injected under the skin since insulin was discovered in 1921.""They urged Vidal to ""give close scrutiny to any of Merck’s requests for new patents for Keytruda, and reject those that do not clearly meet the agency’s standards.""Clinical studies have shown that patients prefer subcutaneous injections to intravenous administration, which can be time-consuming and invasive.Merck said the easier-to-use formulation of Keytruda will be particularly important for treatment of earlier stage disease, as patients may be on therapy for a longer duration.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Mosaic investors that purchase the stock on or after the 1st of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.80 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Mosaic stock has a trailing yield of around 1.6% on the current share price of $51.5. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Mosaic's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Mosaic If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Mosaic has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 6.4% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 7.4% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Mosaic has grown its earnings rapidly, up 60% a year for the past five years. Mosaic looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Mosaic has delivered an average of 4.8% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Mosaic is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.To Sum It UpHas Mosaic got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Mosaic has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Mosaic looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Mosaic (1 is potentially serious!) that you ought to be aware of before buying the shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.Story continuesJames C. O’RourkeGood morning. Thank you for joining our full year 2022 earnings call. Mosaic had a record year in 2022, delivering revenues of $19 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $6.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $11.01. In 2022, we reached several operational milestones that allowed us to benefit from strong prices. K3 reached its initial capacity of 5.5 million tonnes. In Brazil, we grew our distribution market share from 16% to 18%. In North America in phosphates, Performance Products represented 43% of total sales volumes, and now we've begun to look at expanding our MicroEssentials capacity further, which we will discuss later. These efforts are driving strong free cash flow generation, which allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders in 2022, while also strengthening our balance sheet.Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased $1.7 billion worth of shares outstanding. If we include the fourth quarter of 2021, we've bought back more than 10% of the shares outstanding or roughly 40 million shares. In addition to share repurchases, we've also paid investors nearly $200 million in dividends. Our regular dividend now stands at $0.80 per share, up from $0.60 per share the prior year. And on the balance sheet, we met our long-term debt reduction target of $1 billion with the retirement of $550 million of long-term debt in November.Before diving into our business further, I'd like to briefly discuss broader agriculture and fertilizer markets. Ag market fundamentals remain very constructive with December corn near $6 per bushel and November beans near $14 a bushel. This reflects ongoing global food security concerns at a time of disappointing production. Global stocks-to-use ratios are at 25-year lows and remain under pressure because of elevated risks that threaten output in 2023. The world continues to watch the war in Ukraine. We have consulted with top military and foreign policy leaders who share our concern that the conflict seems unlikely to be resolved in the near term and will have long-lasting impacts, particularly in the production of key crops like wheat and sunflowers, which is a source of significant amount of the world's edible oils.Outside of Europe, we believe the USDA's latest estimate for Argentinian production appears optimistic as drought conditions during the growing season suggest yields will disappoint. In Brazil, weather has delayed the planting of safrinha corn which could pressure the record crop that many are forecasting. Around the world, we still see fertilizer shortages in many key agricultural markets, despite some major markets being well supplied. However, the overall shortage still threatens total production, and this will underpin global crop prices for some time.Now let's focus on the fertilizer markets. The sharp spike in nutrient prices in the first half of last year resulted in growers aggressively mining their soils. As we enter 2023, phosphate and potash prices are now half of what they were at the peak. With crop prices still very strong, farmer affordability for nutrients has improved significantly and is now back to the levels seen in 2020 and 2021. This suggests a strong rebound in demand as growers seek to maximize yields with sufficient fertilization. The world is still short of potash. Certain markets are seeing more readily available supply, but this means other markets are not able to get what they need. Belarusian supply remains constrained because of the ongoing sanctions. We believe Belaruskali's exports were down about 8 million tons in 2022, and we expect only modest recovery in 2023 with total exports of around 6 million to 7 million tonnes or half of their pre-sanctioned export volumes.The limited product, Belarus has been able to get out of the country has been aggressively marketed over the seasonally slow winter, and we've seen similar actions from some Russian producers. This is driving recent weakness in prices, but we believe the phenomena is temporary and will reverse as spring demand ramps up. In phosphates, China remains committed to the structural shift impacting where it sends its phosphoric acid. In addition to shutting down production for environmental reasons, a significant portion of phosphoric acid is now being directed to industrial uses, including the battery market. Roughly 1 million tonnes of finished fertilizer equivalent was diverted to the battery market in 2022 and we think that will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years as additional battery capacity is added. This suggests China's exports of phosphate fertilizers will continue to be down significantly as restrictions extend into 2023.Inventory levels in our key markets for both phosphates and potash have declined considerably from the elevated levels observed in the second half of last year. Grower demand across the Americas has been very strong because of favorable affordability, but retailers have been hesitant to replenish inventories because of the volatility in global prices especially in potash with the aggressive off-season marketing from the Russians and the Belarusians. U.S. spring demand is ramping up over the next coming weeks, and we believe we have reached a bottom in potash prices.In Brazil, sentiment has improved. Inventories have worked their way down to much more normalized levels for both potash and phosphates as growers take advantage of much more attractive barter ratios. We estimate fertilizer shipments will total 46 million tonnes in 2023, up more than 10% from last year, and roughly 35% of those expected shipments have already been contracted. In India, phosphate inventories remain very low even after a year of elevated imports as most of the product went straight to the ground.Government subsidies for the coming fertilizer year will determine whether India will be able to attract the nutrients it needs to meet its food security concerns. In Southeast Asia, potash has become much more affordable for palm oil producers as well, which should drive demand recovery. Globally, we're seeing very good farmer economics and depleted inventories that suggest strong demand for phosphates and potash in 2023. Given this landscape, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit from the market's recovery. In phosphates, lingering issues from Hurricane Ian impacted our operations during the fourth quarter for longer than originally expected, but Florida operations returned to normal operating levels earlier this month. We now believe we've moved past the operational issues that impacted output and are dedicating resources to fixing key components in our production.At Bartow, we are upgrading our sulfuric acid production facilities following the recent production stops we saw after Hurricane Ian. And at Faustina, we've improved operations at our ammonia plant and saw a significant increase in the amount of ammonia produced from our plant during the fourth quarter. Florida production has returned to normal operating rates. During the first quarter, we expect total shipments of 1.7 million tonnes to 1.9 million tonnes with realized pricing of $625 to $675 per tonne. We expect stripping margins will remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter as lower raw material prices offset lower finished product prices. In our potash business, slower demand led us to temporarily stop production at our Colonsay mine, but we think the current market situation is temporary and expect to restart operations at Colonsay within the first half of 2023.At Esterhazy, the 12th miner is being commissioned, and the 13th miner is expected to be in service before the end of the year. When that's done, it will add at least 1 million tonnes of additional annual capacity at one of the most efficient mines in the world. In the first quarter, we expect sales of 1.8 million tonnes to 2 million tons with realized MOP prices at the mine of $425 to $475 per tonne. Mosaic Fertilizantes had its best year since we purchased the business in 2018 with adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion in 2022 despite volatility in the second half of the year. Fourth quarter results reflect the sharp reversal of commodity prices from the highs of the first half of the year, which negatively impacted both the production and the distribution margins. But for the full year, our distribution margins averaged $36 per tonne, which is right in the range of $30 to $40 per tonne that we'd expect. First quarter distribution margins will be similar to fourth quarter as higher inventory is worked through. But for the full year, we do expect distribution margins to be back within our normal range.As we think about the evolution of our business, we continue to execute our high-returning investments while returning capital to shareholders. In phosphates, we've begun expansion of our MicroEssentials offering by adding capacity at our Riverview facility. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Upon completion, about 50% of our North American phosphate business will be sales of value-added performance products. This is not an expensive project. Total budget is less than $40 million with a payback period of less than 2 years. We're also building a test plan for purified phosphoric acid production in North America to verify final design plans for commercial operation. This is the next step in our shift away from commodity fertilizers and opens up new markets like food production and batteries.We're also exploring using the plant's byproducts to produce NPKs. In Brazil, we continue to grow our distribution business. While our footprint is already large, there are still areas where we see opportunities to expand. We've begun construction of a 1 million tonne blending and distribution facility at [Pomerance] in the fast-growing North with access to very attractive rail infrastructure. Returns of about 20% and on an expected $80 million budget, make this another example of highly attractive modest investments. We're also monetizing past investments. In January, we sold our Streamsong Resort for $160 million because we could realize appealing value for a noncore asset. Our joint venture in Saudi Arabia is also performing well. In 2022, Mosaic's equity earnings from the joint venture totaled $195 million, which is about 1/4 of our initial investment. This year, they plan to reduce debt by $800 million. They've also distributed $100 million in dividends to investors. Our proportional share of $25 million was received this month.Finally, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to our approach to balance sheet management and shareholder capital returns. In November, we retired $550 million in long-term debt, and this allowed us to meet our commitment of reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. As we look at our balance sheet today, we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Similar to last year, we plan to return substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Since September of 2021, we bought back $2.2 billion in shares, and we continue to see great value in our shares. To emphasize that point, we plan to proceed with a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter. We've also grown our regular dividend to $0.80 per share, and we're well positioned to consider further growth, especially with our reduced share count. In addition to the regular common dividend, our Board of Directors has approved a special dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid out on March 30 to shareholders of record on March 15.Given our strong cash flow, combined with the proceeds of asset sales, our Board approved this payout as a supplement to our ongoing share repurchases. Before we go on to Q&amp;A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered record results in 2022 and we expect favorable dynamics to continue in 2023. The world is short global grains and oilseeds. So farmers are incented to maximize yields. We expect this to drive strong fertilizer demand and our business is well positioned to meet that demand through our existing assets and exciting new growth opportunities. With the strong cash flows that these provide we're returning significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.With that, I'd like to now move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionPaul Abdelmassieh MassoudThanks, Joc. Before we move on to the live portion of this call, as we've done in past quarters, we'd like to address some of the most common questions we received after we published our earnings materials last night. Joc, could you provide a little more color on the potash market? And why we expect Colonsay will need to be restarted in the first half of 2023?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Paul. Let me start by saying we've had a year of low potash usage which means soil levels are depleted, and farmers will need to add potash to the soil to ensure reasonable yields this year. So growers are seeing very attractive economics, and they're acting on it. We're seeing things like our largest channel customer in North America has already got 60% of their farmers' demand is committed for spring, which is higher than most normal years. So as we move into spring, our expectation is farmer demand is going to be good, but everybody is waiting for the last moment. They don't want to live with the price risk. So why we expect a very good season in North America, and we're already seeing a good season in Brazil, we do expect people to wait as long as they feel they can. But once it moves, we expect it to move fairly well.Overall, we do see the potash market as being limited by production. So while demand will be normal, we expect Russia will be exporting less than what they have in the past, probably 1.5 million to plus million tonnes and Belarus will probably export 6 million tonnes to 7 million tonnes, which is half of what they did pre-sanction. So we think this situation today at the standoff is temporary and it will start moving. And when it starts moving, we expect we will have to run hard to supply the market.Jenny, do you want to just give us a little bit of a highlight of where the overall S&amp;D is for potash right now?Yijun WangSure, Joc. As you mentioned, the potash market last year declined by 16%. That was driven by the supply constraint and this year, with a very constructive farm economics. In the markets like North America and South America, we believe farmers have all the incentive to go back to apply potash on the field to maximize their yield. For the markets like China and India, the government, they are concerned to the food security. Therefore, there are a lot of local policies to support the farmers to maximize their production. For that, we actually have seen potash demand increased last year in China. We believe this trend is going to continue. So overall, in 2023, we expect the demand to rebound globally but there's no way to have the full recovery back to 2021 just because the supply is constrained. We are seeing 5 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes of supply shortage in this market.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudJoc, Mosaic Fertilizantes gross margin dropped significantly in the fourth quarter. What drove that margin compression? And how should investors think about margins for the business in 2023?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Paul. Now if we look at the second half of 2022, it reflects a reversal in prices from the first half of the year. This impacted both our distribution and our production business. In our production business, we are now working our way through high-cost raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia. As those move through the system, we expect our margins to get more normalized after the first quarter. In distribution, high cost inventory is now working its way through the system. Now, none of this should have come as much of a surprise because prices were moving up in the first half and coming back down in the second half of the year. So in the first half of the year, we made higher distribution margins. And in the second half of the year, those reversed as we were selling higher-priced inventory into the market. If we look at it over a whole year, both our production business and our distribution business did very well. And overall, '22 was a very successful year and a record year for the Fertilizantes business. Once we get past the first quarter, distribution margins should be in line with our historical expectations of $30 to $40 per tonne, and our production margins will revert to normal stripping margins as well once we work through the high-cost raw materials.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudJoc, how should investors think about our production volumes over the next year? And what types of capital projects is Mosaic initiating to support reliability?James C. O’RourkeThank you. First of all, let me say, the last couple of years, there have been some extraordinary circumstances that have impacted our production, particularly in our phosphate business and our Brazil businesses. First, sulfur shortages coming out of the Gulf of Mexico has hurt us at the start of last year, refinery shutdowns, COVID, transportation limitations at the start of last year and then, of course, a couple of big hurricanes, one that hit Louisiana and the other one last year, which hit directly onto our operations here in Florida. Now, what we saw from those was damage that probably lingered longer than we would have liked because of the condition of some of our plants. So what are we doing to improve that? We're looking at how do we fortify our plants to make them more resilient to this type of occurrence. And some of that means we've replaced a bunch of our converters in sulfuric acid, our boilers or economizers, et cetera.In Brazil, we're building a new sulfur tank, new phosphoric acid tanks are being overhauled. So we're doing a lot of work to really fortify and reinforce the resilience of these plants. So where do we expect these to go? What we've seen already is, for instance, where we've done the repair work at Faustina, in Louisiana, more than 40% of our ammonia last quarter was supplied from Faustina, which is the highest it's been in over a couple of years. So we think we're getting ahead of all of that. Now if I look forward, what do I expect? I expect that we will be running in that 85% to 90% of our 10-K value. So that would probably indicate somewhere in the range of 7.5 million tonnes to 8 million tonnes in phosphates and 3.5 million tonnes in our Brazilian business.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudThis concludes the prerecorded portion of our call. Let's now move on to the live Q&amp;A. Operator?Operator(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneJust following up on that statistic that you provided, Jenny, where global consumption of potash down 16% in 2022 and your estimates for Russia and Belarus sound like down another 10% or down 10% from 2021 in this year. My question for you is, does the world really not need 70 million tonnes of potash or could there be an impact on global crop production this year as a result of this? And/or do you think there could be maybe a bit of a panic to meet farmer demand this spring given the just-in-time purchasing mentality?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Steve. This is Joc. I'll start here and hand it over to Jenny as you requested. But let me say the world does need 70-plus million tons of potash. We believe there is a real need. And what's -- we expect to see happen and what we have seen happen is continents like Africa actually going without product that they really need. So we're actually shorting some regions, Africa and parts of Asia because they can't afford it and even some of Central America. So the reality is, if there was more potash, it would certainly find a home. And obviously, the price sensitivity would be different as it is today, we expect the major markets that can afford will bid up the potash price, and that will be what drives that.So I'm going to hand it over to Jenny to just talk a little bit about that balance.Yijun WangYes, sure. Thanks, Joc. Steve, to your question, what is the impact with a significant demand of shipment reduction last year, we believe that was over 11 million tonnes versus the previous year, we believe the impact to the yield in some of the markets might be reflected on the yield for that year. And in some markets like North America and Brazil, where the farmers, probably they have invested in the potash application. In the previous year, they -- probably they were able to afford for reducing rate for a year, but in 2 years in a row to cut application rate, it is not really a good decision for the farmers to maximize their yield and production. Therefore, we believe the demand recovery of the demand for potash in this market are there. It's just the farmers have the incentive to maximize their production. There are certain markets, as I mentioned in the prerecorded answer, the government are really supporting the farmers to use potash in order to secure their food security. And we believe that government support are going to continue as we are getting into 2023.Lastly on the spring demand, what we heard from our customers and also the growers on the ground, Steve, in North America, in particular, there's a very clear desire based on the affordability and the farm economics that farmers could go back to apply potash, especially for those who skipped a season last year or cut the rate last year. We are at the stage that the farmers need to engage with their retailers and then the retailers to cover the last part of the buying from us. And we see that is happening. In fact, this week, we are seeing increasing inquiries in the south part of the U.S. as the season started. So we feel confident that demand is going to recover for potash and we still, I believe, with a significant constraint on supply and the price will stay at a healthy level, although it is much more moderated from last year.James C. O’RourkeAnd just let me add this, Steve, as well because you asked the question of Colonsay, one of the reasons we believe Colonsay will likely be needed in the first half of the year, as that demand comes back, we think there's a good case for the restart of Colonsay. So it is in hot standby. The labor is there, everybody is ready. Now if we don't need it, it won't come up. But if we do need it, it will come and we expect that might be the -- that is the likely case as we see it.OperatorThe next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.Prashant N. JuvekarYes. Joc, I think you mentioned that 1 million tonne equivalent of fertilizer is going into the battery market. Is that DAP equivalent that you're talking about? Is that a.(technical difficulty) and as the LFP battery grows in China and maybe in the future other parts of the world, what are your expectations there? And do you have any product that goes into that market?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, P.J. Just checking my numbers to make sure I have this right. But -- so yes, your equivalency is correct. We're seeing -- or we saw last year about 0.5 million tonnes of purified phosphoric acid be redirected from fertilizers to batteries. Now that is equivalent to about 1 million tonnes of DAP. And what we're seeing in that market, it was last year, at least, a growth of virtually doubling over 1 year. So we've gone from 500,000 equivalents to 1 million equivalents. And even if that goes to1.5 million equivalent to 2 million equivalent we're going to see a heck of a lot of displaced phosphates not getting out of China. So that's the reason we feel fairly confident that our expectation for exports is reasonable. In terms of our own, we are not supplying any of that market at this stage. We are in the process of doing a pilot study now. We've done this table talk work, and we're now doing a pilot plant to get the design criteria and the costing for our own purified phosphoric acid. And I would expect to be saying more about that in the next 6 months or so, and we'll be talking about making an economic decision after that.OperatorNext question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonYou have a helpful outline on Slide 10, just given the sensitivities to DAP, MOP, so on and so forth. Can you speak to the potential year-on-year benefits from all 3 of your sources of ammonia as well as the average sulfur price, the way you see that trending in the first half. Just any color on that as it pertains to [DAP] margins.James C. O’RourkeSure. Thanks, Chris. I think what you're asking is, if I've got this right, is how is the stripping margin sensitivity to input prices, if you will. And what we expect for the year is, I think what we're seeing is we're seeing an increase in refinery activity, which is leading to a better supply of sulfur and probably making the sulfur market a little looser. But if DAP demand goes up a lot, that could tighten again. But again, that sort of sets itself out with price.And then on ammonia, what we're seeing is a big decline in the price of natural gas in Europe and that price of natural gas, of course, is driving down the price of natural gas here in the U.S. and also driving down the price of our nitrogen inputs. So our expectation is that, that will continue and then flatten. So will continue to decrease for a while, and then it's probably getting close to flattening now where you've got I think urea prices are down in that $300 range, and it can't really go that much lower than that or you'll start seeing production slow down again. So we expect that to happen, and we expect that -- over the year, stripping margins are actually going to be quite flat for us. In other words, the any drop in price will be met because of a drop in raw materials and vice versa.OperatorThe next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonMaybe, Joc, just to clarify that last point on phosphate, stripping margins. So is the implication then that if you're able to ship, I think I heard 7.5 million tonnes to 8 million tonnes of product in 2023 or that would be the current kind of plan as you would sit here today with flat stripping margins that the EBIT -- you think your EBITDA is growing in phosphate? And then the second question I had was just in Fertilizantes again, a bit more of a clarification on the drivers in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. How -- just the weakness in margins between the distribution and the upstream phosphate production, just both businesses will look similar from a margin perspective in the first quarter before normalizing thereafter. I just want to make sure I heard that right.James C. O’RourkeSo I'll answer the first one here, which was -- sorry, I just got to read. Yes, our volume. I think, is -- that's not an unreasonable expectation for volume. The question was in respect to what our production capabilities were. So I will qualify that and say that our -- we always are driven by what is the on-the-ground demand for our product and not necessarily what our production capabilities are. So there could be a gap between what our production capabilities are in our sales but that will depend. Likely, this year, we expect for both potash and phosphate demand will be good. So we expect to sell most of what we make. So that's not an unreasonable assumption.In terms of the pricing, yes, our expectation is that as the season gets moving, both phosphates and potash prices should move up at least somewhat. And I think in the case of potash, it could move up a lot, but -- certainly in phosphates, but we expect that phosphates will kind of balance off with a relatively flat stripping margin, if you will. So that's our basic prediction of where that would go. In terms of Brazil, I would say that both the production business and the distribution business have been equally impacted, one, by rising raw material costs, and the other by just the timing of sales versus purchases of third-party material. So with that in mind, you can think of it as returning back to more normalized level after quarter 1.OperatorThe next question comes from Richard Garchitorena with Wells Fargo.Richard GarchitorenaJust wanted to touch on the plans to restart Colonsay. I guess when you look at the outlook and where we were a year ago when you were planning to expand further, when you start up, I guess how long will it take you to get back to that, I guess, 1.3 million run rate initially when it was shut. And then how are you thinking about moving forward in terms of expanding that capacity? Is it probably going to be more of a '24 event, assuming we have demand recover? Or is that on hold (inaudible) so the market recovers?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Richard. Look, the way I'd look at Colonsay is -- so when we expected the volumes would continue at the rate they were in, let's call it, the middle of the year to the first half of the year. That slowed down significantly in the third and fourth quarter, which was less than what we would expect. So reasonably, we shut down Colonsay. Now like I said earlier, we shut it down. We still have the employees. We still have everything ready to go. So it doesn't take much to restart. But what's happened in the meantime that has to be considered is we've added since that time and because of the slowdown, we've been able to add 2 new miners at Esterhazy. So very soon, Esterhazy will have an incremental capacity of 1 million tonnes. So if you add the 1.3-ish million tonne run rate of Colonsay plus 1 million tonnes of Esterhazy, it doesn't seem to me that we're going to need the second mill at Colonsay. So I would say that, generally, that would be on hold. And a matter of fact, I think the longer the demand waits, the later that Colonsay they would need -- could be down because of Esterhazy taking up the slack.OperatorThe next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsJoc, could you just talk about how you sort of view the shape of the year volumetrically in terms of seasonality and whether as we get after the U.S. spring season, which presumably is going to be quite strong, do you anticipate the supply chain entering a restocking phase? Or do you think they're going to want to have empty bins and there's going to have to be summer fill and all that? And I'm just curious because it seems like everybody is running hand to mouth right now, and I just can't tell whether you're sort of assuming that this is the end of hand to mouth as we get into spring, and then we go back to maybe sort of the supply chain having normal levels of inventory through the year. So what are your thoughts there?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Vincent. Look, I think that right now with the volatility in front of people, people are very concerned with waiting very long, if you will. So everything is always just in time. But of course, the dealers and our customers have to balance that with the need to make sure they get the product they need in time for season. So that's always the balance. My expectation and what we -- Jenny and I were at the Fertilizer Institute meeting a week or 2 ago, and almost through every customer, we're still hearing we would like to have our product in position for the start of the season. We're not going to refill until we need it. And then we want to end the season empty. So that's our expectation, that's what they'll do. But that also means that the summer fill program should be strong here in North America.In Brazil, I think the -- because of the long lead time for everything, it will be a little different than that. And I think the Brazil market will be more stable throughout the year, and we'll see the normal pattern of third quarter being our strongest quarter. And like we've said here, even the safrinha season, we're starting to see some pretty strong demand signals at least. So we think that will continue. We think third quarter will be pretty normal with the U.S. fill. And then the one you've got to consider is, at some point, we need to see and we expect to see Central America, China, India, Asia, the potash going to the Indonesia and Malaysia. We expect all that has to ramp up because they've got a year where they just haven't used the products they need. So even if they're not refilling, they're going to have to buy.OperatorThe next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with Credit Suisse.Edlain S. RodriguezSo a quick question on farmers affordability. It has improved quite a bit as fertilizer prices declined over the past several months. So that's good for the farmers. But what's good for you is for fertilizer prices to start moving higher. But if they do, doesn't that bring back your affordability issue again? So my question is like how do you try to balance that delicate line?James C. O’RourkeYes, Edlain, this is a big challenge for us in that we sit in a global commodity market. And while we try to make sure that the spikes and the troughs are reasonable and that farmer economics stay good, what you see and what we saw last year in the start of the year was panic buying, if you will. So everybody was buying, they were very worried about getting their product. And then the farmer said, ""Well, that's awfully expensive."" And recognize last year, the farmer economics weren't bad. So the psychological piece took a toll. My fear this year is actually somewhat what you said, which is people wait to (technical difficulty) rush to get your product. And suddenly, there's another price spike that does hurt product -- hurt farmer affordability to the point where they're resistant to buying fertilizer again. But I will say, 1 year, you get away with it, the second year we're going to start to see yield drops. And if you start to see yield drops, you're going to see just for the underlying agricultural commodities. So I think it's really self-correcting this year, which is if they don't use the product, yield(technical difficulty) audits will go up, which is going to drive the demand. So I think you can't control it. Hopefully, people buy early enough and we get through in a fairly rational way and farmer affordability stays reasonable.OperatorThe next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS.Joshua David SpectorI just wanted to follow up on an earlier point around, I mean, similar to the prior question in terms of potash affordability. But maybe specifically with the markets that you said were more price sensitive when you're talking about Africa, Asia, et cetera. Are we at a point where that's not an issue today, and you're going to see or expect buying to return. And is there a range if prices move up $50 to $100 a tonne, that's still going to be a point where it's attractive for that region to buy? Or are we still at the point where that's still questionable?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Josh. I think where -- as we look around the world, it really depends on where you're looking. Look, if you're buying fertilizers for -- and the vast majority of fertilizer is used for big crops and export crops. So if you're selling your crop into an international market where you can get the international price, then you're fine and the demand will be there. So if you think about North America, most of South America, Europe et cetera, yes, that's all fine. If you think about Africa, the problem in Africa, and the reason I would say, no, it's not the case, they still can't afford it in Africa is because they're buying for selling into an international market, they're buying for subsistence farming to feed themselves. So whether crop prices are high or not is almost irrelevant because it's how much [they] put into the(technical difficulty) And that's where the supply gap ends up being most acute. And we've heard it from, for instance, the U.S. State Department, which says that parts of Africa are now moving from hunger into acute -- what you call it from hunger to starvation basically. So in Asia, yes, they'll be able to afford it, I think, but if you get to the poorest parts of the world, no. Now does that affect the overall market? Not really because those are not big users in the first place, but that's probably the most tragic part of this whole thing.OperatorThe next question is from Jacob Bout with CIBC.Jacob Jonathan BoutWanted to go back to that discussion on Colonsay and Esterhazy. If I'm not mistaken, Esterhazy is your lowest cost potash mine by far. Just -- why wouldn't the next incremental tonne be coming from Esterhazy? Is there anything that we should be thinking about from a mill or hoist perspective or bringing on incremental capacity?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Jacob, and good to have you back on the call. Yes, your comments are exactly correct. Esterhazy is by far our cheapest or our least expensive to operate mine. And you can think about this as each new miner that comes in, it gives us approximately 400-ish thousand tonnes of new capacity. And there is no limit. As we see it, we expect no limit on the hoist, and we will be plant limited at about the 1 million tonnes of incremental capacity that we've talked about bringing on. So we'll be plant limited by, let's call it, the middle to the end of this year. And at that stage, yes, Esterhazy -- we'll maximize tons from Esterhazy first and only use and then Belle Plaine and then use Colonsay as required.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.Andrew D. WongI just want to go back to LFP. We've seen a couple of LFP projects announced recently in the U.S. I'm kind of curious what's your view on the domestic LFP opportunity. And maybe this is a little bit early, given your grades on pilot testing here, but I appreciate any initial thoughts, like if you were to produce a purified phos acid for batteries, like what would be required for that to happen? Will they do that with the current rock that they have? Or do you need a different type of rock? Or what kind of upgrades would you need to do to your processing plans today? And what kind of costs would that involve?James C. O’RourkeSo thanks, Andrew. Let me say, we've been in the testing phase and I can tell you fairly definitively, that we are capable of making the grades of purified phosphoric acid required for batteries. And as you said, there is a number of LFP lithium iron phosphate plants being talked about in the U.S. here. And we're in discussion with some of those. And obviously, there's nondisclosures for each of those sets of discussions. So I won't talk about specifics, but I can tell you, there is a huge desire amongst those battery manufacturers to have one, a shorter supply chain, i.e., a more stable supply chain out of the U.S. and secondly, a lot of these subsidies and stuff require that the U.S. content to be there. So there's a number of reasons why the market, at least, is very interested in that. And what we're doing now in conjunction with doing the pilot work on this, which is going to give us the design criteria, tell us -- help us define what the costs of both capital and operating will be. But at the same time, we're doing market studies to understand what the final size of this market could be here in North America in particular. But remember, as we think about purified phosphoric acid, there's also the other industrial uses and food and everything else. So this could be quite a useful branch for us to decommoditize to some extent.OperatorThe next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasWith fertilizer prices coming in, should working capital be roughly a source of $700 million in cash in 2023? And secondly, with all of the different ammonia facilities that are being proposed for the Gulf Coast, does it make sense in the future to buy more cost plus ammonia? Or are you happy with what you've got?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Jeff. Let me hit the -- these 2 in terms of -- I missed your first question. Sorry, I got...Yijun WangWorking capital.James C. O’RourkeWorking capital. Yes, you depending on your assumptions, clearly, we are going to work our way through some product that is pretty high priced right now. And depending on what you assume for the final pricing, there's definitely going to be some cash coming into the system from working capital. So in other words, our working capital needs should go down with price, obviously. If I look at this year, I think our working capital has been almost all due to the price of third-party product. So the volumes of our inventory hasn't changed, but the value of that inventory has changed significantly. And that's not for produced product, that's for third-party purchase product.In terms of the ammonia, I think you've -- I hit that exactly on the head in terms of where we're going with our C&amp;F contract, which is we've said that -- this was an 8-year contract with C&amp;F. C&amp;F has given us notice they want to renegotiate it. But if they had not done that, we probably would have as well. Now I think it's worth hedging part of our needs for ammonia with a cost-plus type contract, but maybe it won't be as high a volume as we've done in the past or it might be a different formula. But I think there's ways that is in both ours and C&amp;F's interest to relook at that contract and look at how we price our ammonia going forward. So -- and there's others like OCI and whatnot that have obviously come into that market. So we see ourselves in a pretty good bargaining position for what we do going forward.OperatorThe last question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.Joel JacksonI wanted to ask a bit more about Brazil to understand some of your color around margins. Obviously, a big margin reduction in Q4. I think you said you expect margins in Fertilizante to improve by the end of the year. Can you give a bit more color? Should we expect similar margins in Q1 and improving across the year? And when you say back to, you -- I think historical or average margin. But I don't really know what that is anymore because, obviously, you bought the Vale asset, the mix changed, margins went up with the higher commodity prices. You did a lot of work to improve the assets you have there, some optimization and synergies. What is historical margins in Fertilizante?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Joel. So let me say, historically, we were talking specifically about the distribution margins. And if we look at the distribution margins over time, they've really ended up somewhere in that $30 to $40 per tonne. Now the production business, obviously much more price of phosphate and potash dependent. But if I look at the distribution business, that's not a bad place to start. In terms of how we expect this to play out, we're now buying product at today's price, but that product won't be sold until the end of quarter 1 and into quarter 2. So the product we're working our way through is the higher-priced product from quarter 4 that we were purchasing at that stage because there's that big lag in Brazil of, let's call it, 3 months. So we do expect margins, particularly distribution margins to be similar to what they were in quarter 4, but I may have been misunderstood when I said they were going to build over the year. Over the average of the year, we still expect them to be in that same range of $30 to $40. So that means they have to rebound fairly quickly and we fully expect they will.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joc O'Rourke for any closing remarks.James C. O’RourkeSo thank you, everyone, for all your questions and your interest in us. To conclude our call, I'd just like to reiterate our key messages. Mosaic delivered record results in 2022 and we expect strong business conditions throughout 2023. Farmers around the globe have strong incentives to maximize their yield and fertilizer is in short supply in many parts of the world. So we expect strong demand and Mosaic is well positioned to deliver this for our customers. We are also delivering for our shareholders by returning essentially all of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. So with that, thank you for joining our call, and please have a safe and happy day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

He added Belarus is likely to export only half the potash volume compared with pre-sanctions.Additionally, O'Rourke sees margins normalizing after the first quarter and phosphate production in the range of 7.5 million tonnes to 8 million tonnes in 2023.

Those deliveries will now be delayed until Boeing obtains approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.""An unwelcome blast from the past, but hopefully a brief one,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note, adding that deliveries of 787 jets are the main drivers of $1.7 billion of year-on-year cash flow growth that Boeing projects.The planemaker said the error was found while working through the process to extend the operating timeline for a key part.The current issue is unrelated to a previous quality problem involving gaps around the forward pressure bulkhead that was discovered by the FAA in 2021 and contributed to a delivery stoppage that lasted until August 2022.When Boeing obtained approval from the FAA to restart Dreamliner deliveries, the company said it was required to outfit those 787s with a modified version of the forward pressure bulkhead that would resolve previous quality problems.That version of the component was given a temporary operational limit of four years, providing Boeing time to update its documentation.The component acts as a barrier between the pressurized interior cabin and the radome (or nose cone). It was supplied by Spirit AeroSystems, which said it was too early to assert it made the ""analysis error.""Story continuesShares of Spirit were down 3.7%.The erroneous data analysis was submitted several years ago and was discovered by Boeing this past week, according to the person familiar with the issue.""We are pausing deliveries while we update our analysis and submit any required certification deliverables to address the noncompliance,"" Boeing said.Separately, Boeing said it is replacing a noncompliant component on some undelivered 787s. The trim air muffler, part of the Collins Aerospace-made cabin air distribution system that regulates air temperature, muffles the sound of hot air before it enters the cabin.Boeing said it is coordinating closely with the FAA and customers to determine which 787s will need the muffler replaced. The issue said is not connected to the delivery stoppage and does not pose a safety problem, the company said.Collins declined to comment.(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram and Valerie Insinna in Washington; Additional reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Sherry Jacob-Phillips, Mark Porter and Deepa Babington)]"

Boeing discovered the issue in certification paperwork provided to the US Federal Aviation Administration and notified the regulator.Dreamliner production is continuing as Boeing works to resolve the issue, which the company said doesn’t pose an “immediate safety of flight concern for the in-service fleet.” Boeing expects no change to its 2023 production and delivery targets for the plane, though deliveries will be affected in the near-term, it said.Boeing shares were 1.6% lower overnight trading in New York.The company hasn’t delivered a 787 since Jan. 26, according to data from Ascend by Cirium.The latest delivery halt is likely to be a short-term issue, according to Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co.“Our understanding is that the error is a ‘non-compliance’ with FAA documentation requirements and not a ‘non-conformance’ with a manufacturing specification,” von Rumohr said in a note to clients, who identified the supplier as likely being Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc.The FAA said in a separate statement that deliveries won’t resume until it’s satisfied the issue has been addressed.“The FAA is working with Boeing to determine any actions that might be required for recently delivered airplanes.”The 787 has been plagued by production issues in recent years after Boeing discovered manufacturing flaws in the carbon-fiber fuselage sections.

The expanded access comes after John Hancock became the first life insurance carrier to make the breakthrough screening technology available to a pilot group of customers in September 2022.(PRNewsfoto/John Hancock)Galleri is the first-of-a-kind test available for detection of a shared cancer signal across more than 50 cancer types that can be localized to specific tissues or organs to help clinicians focus their diagnostic evaluation. For the majority of these cancer types, there are no alternative screening options available. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States with 610,000 deaths estimated to occur in 2023. The ACS cites better early detection, among other advances, as a driving factor in reducing the death rate by a third since 19911.""The initial pilot exceeded our expectations in terms of the number of tests requested, validating our hypothesis that our customers want access to this level of insight into their health. It was always our intention to expand beyond the pilot phase and we are thrilled to see this vision come to life,"" said Brooks Tingle, President and CEO of John Hancock Insurance. ""However, our work with GRAIL runs much deeper than just making Galleri accessible to our customers. We believe there is a critical need to expand awareness of and access to this type of groundbreaking technology. As a life insurer, we are deeply committed to helping our customers live longer, healthier, better lives and we know that preventative care and early detection are key components of that mission."" Story continuesThe John Hancock Vitality Program combines life insurance with a technology-enabled program that offers education, support, incentives, and rewards designed to help and encourage customers to live healthier lives. The program covers a broad spectrum of activities — including exercise, nutrition, sleep and mindfulness — and rewards customers for the steps they take to stay healthy. Based on the successful customer uptake during the pilot, John Hancock decided to expand access to the Galleri test, following a similar model, to all eligible John Hancock Vitality PLUS customers, while exploring other potential expansions for the future.""Every day counts for cancer patients and their families,"" said Lindsay Hanson, Vice President, Head of Behavioral Insurance, Global Strategy and Delivery. ""Early detection, through tests like Galleri, is a way to write a different story to a cancer diagnosis. We're proud to bring this technology to our customers.""""The expansion of this first-of-its-kind program shows the benefits of bringing together two industries that share a common goal of improving health outcomes,"" said Bob Ragusa, Chief Executive Officer at GRAIL. ""We are thrilled to see the success of the pilot program and look forward to continuing to work with the leadership at John Hancock as it expands its multi-cancer early detection offering, with the goal of ultimately reducing the burden of cancer and keeping cancer from claiming even more lives.""  Offering access to the Galleri test builds on existing Vitality program features that encourage customers to take part in recommended preventative care, including mammograms and other cancer screenings, annual physical exams, dental visits, and more. The John Hancock Vitality Program is constantly growing and evolving with advances in science to make cutting-edge technology and information available to customers to help them live longer, healthier, better lives.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta CFO, to provide a review of our financial results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions.This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year results, which were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform that delivered another year of solid, safe execution and profitable growth. Additionally, total backlog of $24.1 billion at year-end was a record, and that does not include several notable recent project awards. Driven by the dedication and operational excellence of our world-class employees and the culture of collaboration throughout Quanta, we believe our '22 -- 2022 results also demonstrate the benefit of our diversified portfolio of solutions, our repeatable and sustainable model and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence and total cost solutions for our clients and ultimately, the consumer. Our portfolio of companies; diversity of service lines; geographic coverage; outstanding field leadership; and deep, long-standing and collaborative relationships with our clients have allowed us to successfully navigate through the challenges presented by a global pandemic, and manage ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints, while still delivering 5 consecutive years of record adjusted EBITDA and 6 consecutive years of record earnings per share. We accomplished a great deal in 2022 through the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives and our past success positions us well for the future. Our innovative approach to our structured solutions, our portfolio of services and our passion for working collaboratively with our clients to support their success positions us to be a critical partner in enabling the energy transition for years to come. Here are some of our accomplishments in 2022. We continue to successfully advance our front-end solution strategy, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments. Our focus is on strengthening our design, engineering, permitting, environmental, logistics and program management capabilities. This strategy allows us to expand our solutions to our customers and provide them with greater certainty around cost, time to market and quality, which ultimately benefits consumers. It also enhances our risk management capabilities and increases our total addressable market. Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues achieved record levels, maintained margins and increased market share despite some work delays caused by ongoing supply chain challenges. We further expanded our emergency response capabilities and supported our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by several severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize significant resources to support our customers in times of need is unmatched in our industry. LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, which is managing Puerto Rico's more than 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system, continued to improve its customer service, response times, customer communication and workforce safety as well as overall system reliability. Additionally, LUMA restored power to more than 90% of its customers in less than 2 weeks following Hurricane Fiona, which was much faster than previous storm responses by the prior grid operator and was comparable to, if not better, than restoration times following major hurricanes in the mainland United States. Though many years of challenges and work remain, we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta and the people of Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting LUMA's mission to provide reliable electricity while building a modern and sustainable transmission and distribution system. We continue to grow our communication services business and increased revenues by approximately 30%. Contributing to the growth was further development of our wireless infrastructure solutions, which expand our opportunities to capitalize on 5G network deployment and ongoing enhancement of 4G wireless networks. We continue to make meaningful progress on growing our portfolio of services within each of our operating companies to further enhance our operating results. For example, we are leveraging our gas utility assets to perform certain aspects of underground electric power and telecom-related work. We believe the resource expansion and operating leverage we gained through these initiatives is significant opportunity for Quanta to reinforce our self-perform capabilities, improve operating efficiency and profitability and demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Quanta's capacity model was recognized by the National Safety Council as a finalist for its prestigious Green Cross for Safety Award, which recognizes outstanding projects and organizations working to support the National Safety Council's mission to save lives and prevent injuries from workplace to any place. The capacity model is revolutionary because it only creates a work environment that focuses on preventing an incident but also builds the capacity to fail safely. We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued to grow the opportunities through the repurchase of approximately $128 million of our common stock and a 17% increase of our dividend while also increasing our liquidity. And finally, we continue to increase our efforts and dedicate resources towards implementing sustainable business practices throughout the organization. We made significant progress in our 2021 sustainability report, which discusses the company's accomplishments during that year and marks a key milestone for Quanta as we published our first consolidated set of sustainability metrics, including our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We also highlighted and discussed the important positive impact Quanta has on society and enabling the energy transition and technological development. Demand is robust for our solutions that support our customers, efforts to modernize and harden the grid and prepare it for the impact of increased electric vehicle penetration. This activity drove our Electric Power segment results and backlog strength during 2022, primarily through significant multiyear master service agreements and gains through our service line expansion with utilities. Further, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of utilities undergrounding transmission and distribution lines to protect them from the effects of severe weather events and wildfires. We see this activity increasing in the Western United States in high-fire threat areas, but these initiatives are active in other areas of the country. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coastlines and electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale multiyear system modernization and hardening programs. Our utility and renewable development -- developer customers, who accounted for the majority of our 2022 revenues, are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions, increase electrification and lead the energy transition with aggressive plans to expand and modernize the power grid and grow their renewable generation portfolios. Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and renewable generation facilities to produce and transport clean power to ensure grid reliability due to the growth of intermittent power added to the system. For example, in December of last year, we announced Quanta's selection by Xcel Energy as its prime constructor to manage all construction activities for Colorado's power pathway high-voltage electric transmission project in Colorado. The approximately 610-mile high-voltage electric transmission line project is designed to increase the reliabilities of the state's power grid and enable future renewable energy development in Colorado, including approximately 5,500 megawatts of new wind, solar and other resources that Xcel Energy plans to add through 2030. While the supply chain and regulatory hurdles created challenges for the renewable industry during 2022, there is significant demand for our power grid and renewable generation solutions. A number of solar projects that were delayed in 2022 are beginning to move forward in '23. Regulatory hurdles are easing and the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA, which is considered by many to be the nation's most ambitious legislative action ever taken on climate, is expected to have meaningful positive effect on a number of our end markets, which would be additive to our strategy for at least the next decade. Our underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment consistently performed at a high level through the year. Revenues grew strongly and margins significantly improved after navigating through tough operating conditions caused by the global pandemic over the prior 2 years. Importantly, we continue to invest in our people and strategies during those challenging times and emerge as a stronger and better company, which is reflected in our solid 2022 results. We expect to continue our focus on growing our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services business -- businesses, consistent with our strategy over the last 5 years, which are executing well and driven by regulatory spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Looking to the coming years, we continue to believe Quanta has meaningfully -- meaningful opportunities with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets toward greener business opportunities. Further, the IRA includes incentives to support certain energy transition technologies to further encourage a broader set of current and potential traditional energy and industrial customers to accelerate their pursuit of opportunities around these technologies. In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2023 guidance, which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our portfolio approach to the business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute our strong and strengthening competitive position in the marketplace. Further, our ongoing investment in and commitment to workforce training continues to positively impact our performance and allow us to capitalize on future opportunities. Our expectations call for another year of meaningful growth and record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and earnings per share. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve record levels of backlog in 2023. Jayshree will provide additional detail about our guidance in our commentary. Quanta's management team recently had the privilege of ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to commemorate our 25-year anniversary of trading on the prestigious exchange. Standing on that balcony and reflecting on what we have built over the last 25 years and where we are heading in the future, it was humbling, and I couldn't be prouder. Quanta's infrastructure solutions are at the tip of the spear of the energy transition in North America. At our Investor Day last year, we laid out a 5-year financial goals we expect to achieve through 2026, which provided an organic growth strategy to generate a 10% adjusted earnings per share CAGR and when considering the levers available to us, to allocate future cash flow generation into value-creating opportunities, a platform with opportunity to deliver more than a 15% CAGR in adjusted earnings per share. With the strong results we delivered last year, our outlook for 2023 and the momentum we see building for the coming years, we are increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed those goals we laid out. We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree?Jayshree S. DesaiThanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. .Today, we announced record fourth quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $163 million or $1.10 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record for the fourth quarter at $1.68. Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another year of exceptional operational performance by Quanta. Our electric segment benefited from outstanding execution and higher revenues across the segment. Additionally, our underground segment performed well in the fourth quarter, led by increased volumes and operating income from our base business operations. Our renewables segment, however, was negatively impacted by unanticipated project delays, which were primarily attributable to the changes in the solar market regulations that we discussed in the third quarter. These delays created cost absorption challenges, which pressured operating margins. Additionally, the segment's operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to impairment charges on the software implementation project at an acquired company, which commenced prior to our acquisition, but was discontinued in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, in the aggregate, against the backdrop of supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and a complex regulatory environment, our portfolio delivered against our targets for the fourth quarter and the year, and we remain well positioned for the anticipated growth ahead. Below the line, we recorded an unrealized loss of $15 million associated with our common equity interest in fixed wireless broadband technology provider, Starry Group Holdings, which reduced the carrying value of our investment to 0. Offsetting this unrealized loss was an unrealized gain of $26 million on the sale of an investment in a nonintegral unconsolidated affiliate, of which $10 million was attributable to a noncontrolling ownership interest. Further commentary comparing fourth quarter '22 to fourth quarter '21 for each segment can be found in the slides accompanying this call. Our total backlog was $24.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, a significant increase from third quarter '22 and another record level. The increases across each of our segments are attributable to multiple new project awards including the previously announced Colorado Power Pathway Project and extensions and increases in expected volumes under MSAs. Our 12-month backlog was also at a record level of $13.8 billion, which we believe is another indicator of the strength of our core markets and the steady growing demand for a solutions-based approach. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated free cash flow of $513 million, resulting in $767 million of free cash flow for the year. Contributing to our free cash flow was the collection of $101 million of insurance proceeds following a favorable arbitration ruling associated with our Peruvian subsidiaries' terminated telecommunications project. Excluding those proceeds, our fourth quarter cash flow was still in line with our expectations and included planned outflows of approximately $45 million for change of control related payments associated with the Blattner acquisition, and $54 million of previously deferred payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act in 2020. DSO measured 75 days for the fourth quarter of 2022, which was a reduction of 6 days compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable billing arrangements related to certain projects. Regarding the Canadian renewable transmission project that we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work with the customer to address the contract asset balance. Resolution of certainties of these amounts could extend into 2024 and currently represent 5 to 6 days of DSO at December 31, 2022. While we remain confident in our position, our DSO will be pressured by the project in the near term. We had total liquidity of $2.4 billion at year-end and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1 as calculated under our credit agreement. As we mentioned in today's release, we continue to identify and make strategic investments and acquisitions. In January of 2023, we acquired 3 businesses for total combined consideration of approximately $588 million, approximately $465 million of which was paid in cash at the time of the acquisitions. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $128 million of our common stock during the year. Turning to our full year 2023 guidance. The growth across our end markets remains robust, and we believe the tailwinds driving our growth are long in duration and create multiyear visibility in our earnings potential. As the build-out of the infrastructure necessary for the energy transition accelerates, we believe the complementary capabilities of our operations will become even more valuable to our customers. While segment designations help investors better understand the work we're performing, we'll continue to emphasize the power of our aggregate portfolio of solutions and the earnings they generate. That said, the following remarks will speak to our expectations at a segment level for 2023. As it relates to the Electric Power segment, we expect 2023 revenues ranging between $10 billion and $10.1 billion. Our base business continues to lead the growth in the segment, driven primarily by North American utilities outsourcing the activities required to replace, rebuild and modernize existing infrastructure. Notably, our 2023 expectations included $250 million of emergency restoration services revenues compared to a little over $300 million in 2022. Also included within the segment are communications operations, which we expect will generate around $900 million of revenue, in line with 2022 levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the electric power segment to range between 10.7% and 11.3%, which includes contributions of between $43 million and $48 million of earnings from our integral unconsolidated affiliates, the largest portion of which relate to the LUMA joint venture in Puerto Rico. From a seasonality perspective, we expect revenues to be lowest in the first quarter with mid-single-digit growth from first quarter '22, then growing sequentially through the third quarter, followed by a seasonal decline in the fourth. We expect fourth quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, likely around 9%, then increasing into the second and third quarters and slightly declining in the fourth quarter. The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment full year revenues are expected to range between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion. Over 15% growth compared to 2022 as we believe the headwinds faced by the solar market in '22 should meaningfully improve in the second half of 2023. We think it's important to note that within our range of guidance for renewables, approximately $3 billion of our planned revenues are already in various stages of construction, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver full year revenues at these levels. We expect 2023 operating margins for the Renewable Energy segment to be around 8.5% for the year, slightly lower than the 9% level that we would normally expect. We've invested meaningfully in the project leadership, specialized equipment and administrative needs required to support the expected ramp in project activity in the second half of '23 and into '24. However, the cost of that investment weighs on margins, particularly in the first quarter. We expect margins for the first quarter to be the lowest for the year, likely between 4% and 5%, but should strengthen in each sequential quarter as volumes increase throughout the year. From a revenue seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues to be between $850 million and $900 million in the first quarter, the lowest for the year, then growing sequentially into the third quarter and slightly declining in the fourth. As a reminder, it's possible that as we progress through the year and gain more visibility into the nature of the work we'll be performing, there could be movements outside these initial ranges for the electric and renewable segments, depending on the type of generation our activities support. With regard to the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, we are currently anticipating full year revenue range to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, a slight decline compared to 2022. This decline is due to lower volumes of larger pipeline projects, which contributed almost $900 million of revenue in 2022, but are expected to be around $450 million in 2023. Despite the revenue reduction, operating margins for the year are expected to range between 7.25% and 7.75% led by our base business activities in the segment. From a seasonality perspective, we expect segment revenues in the first quarter to be in line with first quarter '22 revenues, with operating margins around 5%. We then expect revenues and margins to improve in the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. As it stands today, we expect fourth quarter '23 revenues to be the lowest for the year. These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2023 annual consolidated revenues of $18.4 billion to $18.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. This represents another record level of adjusted EBITDA with expected full year adjusted EBITDA margins at the midpoint of over 10%. With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for 2023 to be between $4.67 and $5.17 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $6.75 and $7.25. Of note, we estimate our tax rate for the year will range between 26.25% and 26.75%. The first quarter rate, however, will be negligible, potentially 0, due to favorable discrete tax dynamics associated with the increase between grant date value and the vesting date value of stock-related awards under our equity compensation plan. We currently expect 2023 free cash flow to range between $750 million and $1 billion with capital expenditures of around $400 million, which should give us the ability to be within our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2x by the end of 2023. We remain committed, however, to creating shareholder value with strategic acquisitions and opportunistic repurchase activity throughout the year while retaining our investment grade rating. Going into 2023, we have approximately $345 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. As a reminder, we've provided more guidance details in the outlook summary that was posted in connection with the earnings release and can be found on our IR website at quantaservices.com. The strength and versatility of our portfolio give us confidence in our ability to continue driving results against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. The infrastructure investment required to support North America's energy transition is still in its early stages and creates opportunity for Quanta to continue providing industry-leading, comprehensive, end-to-end solutions. Our relationships and the breadth of our solutions have proven to be critical in our ability to navigate the economic landscape of the last 3 years, and we are confident those attributes position us to continue along our expected double-digit growth trajectory. This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.Alexander John RygielExcellent quarter. A few quick questions. Duke, backlog growth is fantastic here. Obviously, some of that is from some of your acquisitions. But I guess what I'm trying to get at is how do you think about backlog growth over the next couple of years? And maybe if you could sort of comment on what you think your bid pipeline sort of looks like as it relates to backlog? Do you see an acceleration in your bid pipeline? It sounds like you might be seeing that, but any thoughts there would be helpful.Earl C. AustinThanks, Alex. The backlog is really not material when you look at the acquisitions, so take that out. I think we had broad-based backlog growth within the company. And as we look forward, I think you'll continue to see that throughout '23. The dynamic of the stacking of larger projects along with what we see at our MSA levels continue to be robust. And I think it will be broad-based on our renewables as well as our electric power and even in U&amp;I segment. So we see a robust markets there. As we look at the bid pipelines, I think both the renewable side, you see more of elongation out where it was just 12 months, you're seeing 24-month, 36-month type things within our backlog. So that's creating that growth as well there. But the pipeline itself, larger projects are certainly in there. But our MSA business, base business is robust as well. So just a broad-based kind of look at the business at this point.Jayshree S. DesaiAlex, just to add and to clarify that the acquisitions were done in January, so they are not in our backlog.Alexander John RygielFair enough. And then secondly, you referenced ongoing supply chain challenges. There's a couple kind of thoughts on that topic. And one is supply chain challenges kind of hold back your ability to obviously acquire equipment to execute on projects, but also kind of when you layer into that Quanta's historical achievements in managing difficult labor supply chain challenges and educating and training internally. Can you talk about how those supply chain challenges have allowed Quanta to gain market share kind of in this current environment right now and moving forward?Earl C. AustinWe anticipated the labor. So I think craft skilled labor is still at the core of the business. We've invested in it long ago and not -- we continue to invest in it today. That is something that we are in front of. The supply chain challenges with the fleet, we've done a nice job, have great partnerships in our fleet over the years, certainly leverage. I think we have the fourth largest fleet in North America. So it's something that we challenge ourselves to be in front of that as well with our suppliers and the same collaborative manner that we use with our customers, we use with our suppliers. So I certainly give us an advantage, but also gives us a look in the future. And I just think we'll stay on top of the 2 things that we manage and can control is labor and fleet. So we manage them pretty tough.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaCongrats on a great quarter here. I wonder if you'd spend some time on the renewable segment. And if you could comment on first, how the Inflation Reduction Act is impacting customer conversations? And when we -- when you think it will start to show up in terms of either backlog and revenue? And then Jayshree, you made some comments about operating income at the segment moving in the right direction as you think about 2023. Can you help us -- give us the building blocks to think about that?Earl C. AustinYes. With the Renewables segment, when we look out the IRA, certainly it's additive to anything we've talked about. To get your hands around it and what it actually means, I don't think we see anything at this point that has the consequences thereof. It does give us certainty over the next 10 years within that. But as our backlog, as we're having the conversations today, it's certainly about U.S. content, how we look at labor, all those kind of things within the IRA bill. So that's something the company has done a nice job of getting in front of and we're proud of that. I'll let Jayshree comment on the rest of it.Jayshree S. DesaiYes. Neil. The Renewables segment margin and revenues, basically, as we said, will be a little down in the first quarter, but it will be picking up as we move throughout the year. And that's really driven by the fact that as the industry gets more and more comfortable with where the IRA is headed as projects move forward with PPAs and financing, we should see a big pick up in the back half of the year. We have been prudent with our guidance given some of the still supply chain issues and the tariff situations that are out there. However, we're seeing a lot more interest, a lot more movement, and it should start developing in the back half of the year and especially into 2024.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.Justin P. HaukeI've got a, I guess, a question just on the guidance and the acquisitions that you did post quarter. Just the $580 million that -- for 3 deals is actually a fairly large amount for you guys when you usually do kind of more smaller bolt-on ones per quarter. So maybe you could just give a little bit of guidance around the revenue and EBITDA contribution in 2023 from that incremental M&amp;A?Jayshree S. DesaiYes, the revenue contribution is around $600 million for those 3 deals. And I would just say that from an EPS contribution, they contribute around $0.15 to $0.20.Earl C. AustinAnd as far as -- it's 3 deals, and they're all within the strategic platform that we've set out and a regional T&amp;D. One addresses the front end side of the solar markets and wind, so batteries, et cetera. And the other one is the supply chain kind of contribution there. So 3 things that we felt like we're right down the middle for us. We've always said the timing and how we deploy capital. It's -- sometimes it's lumpy, sometimes it spreads out. So I wouldn't read anything into it.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.Jamie Lyn CookCongrats on a nice quarter. I guess just back to the renewable margins. I think you guys talked about investing in the business, which is weighing on margins, in particular in the first quarter. Can you help us understand like the investments that you're making and how to think about -- how much that's impacting the margin guidance for the year? So I guess that's my first question. And my second question is, I'm sort of struck with the guidance that we're implying for 2023. $7, you're a company that typically guides fairly conservatively. So trying to think about if there's upside to the numbers in 2023 or downside to the numbers, could you just calibrate where the upside or downside could be given the good guide already?Earl C. AustinYes. Thanks, Jamie. When we think about the renewable segments, it's primarily around utilization and how quickly you're going to get absorption early on. And as we move on to the projects that are stated, certainly, you get absorption in the back half. You're a little light, and you saw it in the fourth quarter, you'll see it in the first quarter. We know the projects that we're on. We talked about $3 billion that we have started. The back half, when we look at the back half, certainly, there's opportunities there. We were prudent about how we looked at it.We felt like with the way that the supply chain worked this year, especially on the panels and things of that nature and how the IRA comes in and how quickly it comes in, we take the same approach to guidance every year, which is prudent, and I believe we did the same this year. It's exactly the same way.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel.Noelle Christine DiltsI know there's been a fair amount of discussion around supply chain. But I have heard that the transformer issue remains fairly challenging with extremely long lead times. So -- and we've talked about that before. So I was actually just curious to what extent you think that's getting better? Are things getting a little bit more predictable as it relates to some of these components that have been in short supply, specifically as it relates to electric T&amp;D?Earl C. AustinThanks, Noelle. The -- when we look at the supply chain, most of your larger IOUs, your larger customers, have solved much of this, not to say that the transformers and certain items are long lead times, they are. And it is issues -- there is issues around it. But once we understand it, once we understand cadence, we can be much more predictable about how we deploy crews and assets. So that's helped us. I do think there's opportunity there for us and how we participate in solving these solutions with the client. That said, I don't -- transformers is going to be a while. I think the back half of the year, maybe even into the fourth quarter before that levelizes out and we get enough capacity in the market. But with the amount of EV penetration, the things that we see, you're going to see some shortages in transformers, and we just have to be more robust about how we deploy assets.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.Steven FisherJust on the electric transmission and distribution kind of customer spending outlook. There's been some mixed data points on utility CapEx over the last few months, but I guess still, overall, positive. I'm curious what discussions you're having with the utility customers, specifically around the planning for the IIJA funds. How are they baking those into their spending patterns? And how will that ultimately flow into your bookings and backlog?Earl C. AustinYes, thanks. Here's what we see. We see North America is load growing as we look at it across our segments. So the growth of generation in North America, you have that going on, you have renewables and the way that we're looking at penetration through transmission, you have EV penetration ongoing. So all those things are coming in to these CapEx. And I hear that and I hear well, you've seen something different. All I've seen is our customers moved our CapEx budgets up, primarily in distribution, on the outer end because of penetration of EV and then all your transmission that needs to be interconnected. The way that you think about it, you think about all the things that are necessary to make this work. Yes, you can delay a bit. You can do some things. But we're already behind on -- just in general, if you stay flat on carbon today, you can't -- we're struggling to serve the load at the customer level on the coastlines. And that's our duty to -- this industry's duty to the consumer is to have load and if you have wells that are offshore, if you have things that don't allow us to build generation that's necessary to get to a carbon-free environment, we have to have more transmission. So either way you look at this, on any level, the capital necessary to transform and to make sure that this country has a resilient grid will require a significant amount of capital.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.Adam Robert ThalhimerGreat quarter. Great outlook. Hey, a quick question on electrical margins. So the guidance range for margins this year, 10.7% to 11.3%. It's the same guidance we started last year with and we ended up at the low end, 10.7%. So my question would be, what factors drove you to the low end last year and what could drive you to the high end of this year?Earl C. AustinYes, we talked about the segment. And when you look at it, I mean, I think in general, this year, the supply chain on the way -- well, you had inflation, you had fuel costs rising, a bunch of different things going on, and we talked about that early on in the first half that we thought we could operate through it in the second half, and we did.So we've got that in our system now. We understand cadence around supply chains and things of that nature. So it gives us a great more deal of comfort that we can operate in the higher end of the range, not in the lower. So that's -- that's just us understanding what markets we're in. We're still -- our guide's at 12% EBITDA, something like that. A lot of people talk about EBITDA, so it's 12% EBITDA.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.Charles Albert Edward DillardSo Duke, I want to go back to your comments about your focus on front end. And my question is, by how much does that greater focus on front end work expand your TAM? And then like would you classify this as a pull from your customers versus a push from Quanta? And then how are you thinking about building this out? To what extent do you plan to focus on inorganic acquisitions versus just organic building?Earl C. AustinWhen we look at the market, if you take it all, it's 30% or so of total addressable market within our client base. And I -- we continue to build that out because what was happening, and it made us less efficient and also the client less efficient. And I believe from a construction standpoint, how we approach it, how we approach the front end, we can give a lot more certainty to any project. So it was necessary, in my mind, for us to get in that business. And yes, the customer is happy with it. The projects that we have done, the programs that we are ongoing are certainly something that we'll continue to build off as we move into the future. And that market is there. It makes us more efficient on the backside of a lot of reasons for us to like that piece of business. And we'll continue to invest.Charles Albert Edward DillardGot it. Okay. And then my second question is just on the supply chain. Can you talk about what's embedded in your '23 guide in terms of improvement maybe like versus where we are today? And then just going to the Renewables segment, how much of the revenues in '23 were delayed in '22?Earl C. AustinAs far as the supply chain, what we see today, what we've seen over the past quarters is how we looked at it going forward. If it gets better, certainly, we'll come back and we'll talk about it, but we see intermittency in the supply chain on the utility side for the year, basically. I do think the renewable segment, supply chain gets better in the second half, and we've certainly looked at that as well. But how much better? I'm not sure. And if it does, if it creates, there is some conservatism in the renewables segment due to that. We've baked all that in, and I feel like hit it down the middle with prudent guidance. And as far as the revenue, I'll let Jayshree talk about it.Jayshree S. DesaiYes. I would say it's a mix. It's hard to -- I don't want to sit here and say how much is due to delays versus -- there's a -- there has been additional backlog on the renewable segment, that's starting to come in, and you've got some projects that have moved into the -- from '22 to '23. It's both.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.Michael Stephan DudasDuke, you announced several large T&amp;D projects over the last couple of months. Can you talk about what you have in the pipeline relative to those types of projects and what your selectivity might be going forward? And maybe how that plays out over the next several years because these are much longer gestation projects than we have in your base business, I would assume.Earl C. AustinYes. Thanks, Michael. We talked about the stacking effect of the projects, the larger projects they stack on the base. I think when we went through CREZ 7, 8 years ago, the company got off the base. I would tell you today, we're highly focused on our base business roughly 85%, 90% of that resilient business that we have. We'll continue to focus on that. We're bidding every project the same. We bid the risk. We're not going to win them all. We're just not. And I've watched one recently look at -- we knew our cost, we know what we're doing. We're not going to take risks. It's not something we're going to gamble on. If -- we're just not. And it's not Vegas. We're going to get ourselves in a good position to make sure that we execute on these projects. And we don't need to necessarily take the larger projects. We can build our base. But we do see an incremental amount of larger projects coming in, in '23, '24 and beyond.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.Brent Edward ThielmanDuke, the expectation for reduction in large pipeline work in '23 versus '22, is that just a function of sort of project sequencing for your business? Because your backlog is up pretty nicely in underground or is that just sort of reflective of the environment we're in? And I'd also just be curious if there's opportunities to still fill that void you're sort of talking about for the underground business late in the year.Earl C. AustinYes, the backlog was primarily driven by MSA growth there. And when we look at the larger diameter pipe, we talked about guiding to kind of a $450 million, $500 million type range year-over-year. Certainly, there's opportunities for us to do $1 billion and I -- that opportunity is out there. We guided to where we're at. Just for us, we can make the numbers in a portfolio approach where we're at. I felt comfortable with them. We felt comfortable if things move. Let's just say solar moved or let's say large pipe went the other way. The portfolio we have makes us, what I think, very predictable. And got those larger dynamics of pipe and some of our renewable projects, we took a prudent approach to guidance. We'll update you. If we get more work, we'll certainly update.Operator(Operator Instructions) At this time, I'm not seeing any questions coming in. I'd like to pass it back over to the Quanta management team for any closing comments.Earl C. AustinYes, I want to thank the men and women in the field. They are putting up the numbers every day and working safe. It allows for a great call and for us to talk about how great the company is doing. And certainly, after 25 years of Quanta, I think we're just getting started. So I'd like to thank everyone for participating in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you, and this concludes our call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for ANSYS ANSYS' Improving ProfitsEven with very modest growth rates, a company will usually do well if it improves earnings per share (EPS) year after year. So it's no surprise that some investors are more inclined to invest in profitable businesses. It's good to see that ANSYS' EPS has grown from US$5.22 to US$6.01 over twelve months. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 15% gain.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for ANSYS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 8.3% to US$2.1b.

Wells Fargo bankers were recently treated to such a company-sponsored trip to the city, a common feature in the finance world following a successful year. Now, just weeks after the retreat, many who went to Palm Desert have had to pack their bags after Wells Fargo laid them off. Hundreds of mortgage bankers have reportedly lost their jobs in the past week as the San Francisco–based bank shifted its strategy, CNBC reports. The cuts involved more than 500 employees in the mortgage unit, according to Bloomberg.Originally announced on Tuesday, the layoffs at Wells Fargo have affected several top-performing mortgage bankers and home loan consultants, CNBC reports. The compensation of many of those laid off reportedly hinged on sales volume.Chief executive Charles Scharf took office in 2019, and under his leadership, Wells Fargo has been shrinking its mortgage market operations to focus more on serving existing clients and minority communities. The layoffs affected those in departments where the company is no longer placing as much emphasis. “We announced in January strategic plans to create a more focused home-lending business,” a Wells Fargo spokesperson told Fortune. “As part of these efforts, we have made displacements across our home-lending business in alignment with this strategy and in response to significant decreases in mortgage volume.”Housing slump hitsThe slump in the housing market began to hit Wells Fargo last year. The lender cut hundreds of its mortgage employees in late 2022 following months of slowing business activity. Its mortgage volumes shrunk significantly in the last three months of 2022, down 70% to $14.6 billion compared to the same time in 2021. Its peers have taken similar steps to ease costs and cope with sluggish business activity. JPMorgan Chase earlier this month slashed hundreds of jobs in its mortgage lending division, which took a hit under the Fed’s hawkish interest rate policy, which makes it harder for potential homebuyers to access loans. Other banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have also cut thousands of jobs.Wells Fargo has been in troubled water for a few years amidst a bevy of scandals that came to light in 2016, involving mismanaged funds and fraudulent accounts. These cost Wells Fargo millions of dollars in penalties and legal fees and resulted in a cap on the bank’s assets. Last December, the bank reached a settlement of $3.7 billion with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, including over $2 billion to pay back consumers. The company is also being investigated for allegedly conducting fake job interviews for minority candidates to fulfill diversity guidelines. The errors in record-keeping and other wrongful practices took place at least through 2011 and 2022.Wells Fargo did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment made outside regular operating hours.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

Please go ahead.Yvonne BriggsThank you, operator, and good afternoon. This is Yvonne Briggs with LHA. Thank you all for joining today's call to discuss OPKO Health's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. I'd like to remind you that any statements made during this call by management other than statements of historical fact will be considered forward-looking and as such, will be subject to risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the company's expected results.Those forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the various risks described in the company's SEC filings including the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in subsequently filed SEC reports. The conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast today, February 23, 2023. Except as required by law, OPKO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.Before we begin, let me review the format for today's call. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will open the call. Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Vice Chairman and President of OPKO will then provide an overview of OPKO's pharmaceutical business as well as BioReference Laboratories. After that, Adam Logal, OPKO's CFO, and will review the company's fourth quarter financial results, and then we'll open the call to questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Frost.Story continuesPhillip Frost(technical difficulty) Somatrogon are underway by our commercial partner, Pfizer. NGENLA is our once-weekly injectable growth hormone product developed to ease a patient's burden versus the standard daily injections. Pfizer has launched the product in 15 countries, including Japan, Germany and the U.K. and expects to have launched in all priority markets by the end of the year. As I mentioned on our last call, NGENLA is starting to post significant sequential quarterly sales growth and Adam will review OPKO's profit share and royalty payments in his prepared remarks.We believe Pfizer is making progress in the U.S. to advance NGENLA through the regulatory process and address the FDA's comments. We continue to work with Pfizer as they stand by their commitment to commercialize NGENLA globally and we'll provide further updates on its regulatory status in the U.S. and commercial progress in foreign countries.As for our clinical diagnostics business, BioReference Laboratories is making significant progress in reducing costs and rightsizing the business. In parallel, BRL is expanding its portfolio by focusing on innovation and specialty testing segments, including oncology, women's health and urology while driving growth with novel partnership arrangements. Elias will provide further details on the lab and it's performance following his commentary on the pharmaceutical business.With that brief overview, I will now turn the call over to Elias. Elias?Elias Adam ZerhouniYes. Thanks, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. I think it has been an eventful 2022 for OPKO and I'm looking forward to further progress in 2023 with quite a few significant milestones on the horizon.Let me start with the pharmaceutical business division where we have made significant progress at ModeX Therapeutics by first, enhancing our proprietary platform technologies known as MSTAR and STEALTH with 8 patents filed. These multi-specific antibodies provide flexibilities to go beyond 3 targets up to a total of 6. We believe MSTAR is a plug-and-play, flexible adaptive platform that optimizes functionality and manufacturing simplicity. We believe that this provides a competitive advantage over other multi-specific technologies.In parallel, we have focused on advancing our portfolio significantly now containing 7 assets, 1 of which is in the clinic in Phase I and 5 in late preclinical stages with 3 of the 5 planned to enter the clinical stages by end of 2023 or beginning of 2024.For infectious disease, we continue to advance the development of [MDX-2201] a first-in-class Epstein–Barr virus nanoparticle vaccine. EBV infects up 95% of the global adult population during their lifetime and is associated with about 1% of all cancer cases worldwide. It also is the leading cause of infectious mononucleosis. Despite the virus' prevalence, and its role in causing life-threatening diseases, there are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or treatments for EBV.Our vaccine leverages ModeX's innovative biologics platform to target 4 major EBV proteins. This multi-targeted approach improves upon previous efforts and holds potential to provide complete protection against EBV infection. The initial indication for this vaccine will be for infectious mononucleosis, but it's ultimately intended for cancer prevention. Very much like the human papillomavirus HPV vaccines that protect against cervical cancer. EBV is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, certain gastric and other cancers. So it has the potential to prevent over 200,000 malignancies associated each year with this virus. And potentially, could be indicated for multiple sclerosis disease, now believed to also be associated with the Epstein–Barr virus. We also have a tri-specific candidate in Phase I clinical trials to treat HIV that has received funding from the NIH as well as 2 preclinical tri and tetra-specific candidates with increased potency that also target HIV. We hope to investigate the potential for such multispecific antibodies to suppress virus replication after interruption of antiretroviral drug treatment. Such a therapy could potentially decrease the need for continuous drug treatments, whose multiple side effects cause secondary complications and decrease therapeutic compliance. In addition, we have several SARS-CoV-2, multispecific antibodies in late preclinical testing, partially funded by DARPA. These candidates potently neutralize all known circulating variants of the virus and may help to limit the continued spread of the virus.We're particularly interested in exploring whether such antibodies could be used to protect subjects with weakened immunity, such as patients with cancer, diabetes, or asthma or autoimmune diseases. There is also an interest in using such antibodies to treat long COVID, a complication of COVID infections. In oncology, we have 2 multi-specific multifunctional antibodies focused on hard-to-treat solid tumors and 1 focused on liquid tumors. These oncology programs are in the preclinical stage with the goal of entering the clinic in early 2024. We've also worked to make ModeX more visible to the outside world with a busy schedule presenting at several scientific meetings. In January, we presented at the Safety and Efficacy of Bispecific Antibodies, ADCs and Combination Therapy conference regarding our 3 specific antibody technology. On the 22nd of this month, we participated in the Keystone Symposia on molecular and cellular biology and presented a poster titled trispecific antibody targeting HER2 and T cells inhibiting breast cancer growth via CD4 cells. In March, our team will be at the festival of biologicals presenting multi-specific targeting for the treatment of infections and cancer.Taken together, ModeX Therapeutics represents a fundamental change in the direction for OPKO, shifting the balance from diagnostics to therapeutics and offering innovative solutions to pressing unmet needs for cancer and viral disease prevention and treatment. And we will present a more complete view of our R&amp;D portfolio on March 20, 2023.In addition, the pharmaceutical division is working to advance RAYALDEE for the correction of secondary hyperthyroidism a major complication of chronic renal disease and exploring new strategic partnerships to accelerate its commercial growth. We're also exploring strategic partnerships to advance our programs in Alzheimer's disease and (inaudible) and have supported as well during the past few months the response of Pfizer to the FDA for the approval of somatrogon.Now I'd like to turn to our diagnostics segment and discussed by reference laboratories. Our continued priority is to return this business back to profitability post COVID. As such, we have been aggressively reducing costs and have reached our stated goal of eliminating approximately $140 million of annualized expenses since February 2022.We will continue our Reach initiative, which is designed to improve productivity and reduce costs which has touched every part of the organization, and we're targeting more than an additional $30 million of reductions or about 5% of our expected spend in 2023. As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to focus on operational excellence, including revenue cycle management, while pursuing efficiencies in virtually every aspect of this business, including refocusing on our higher-margin products post COVID and geographic redeployment of our patient service centers with 11 new patient service centers opened so far and 13 less productive centers closed in 2022.As we stabilize our core testing business, our higher-margin specialty testing segments continue to outperform. As Phil mentioned, these segments include oncology, women's health, urology and special ventures. We're focused on continuing to drive growth in these segments by bringing innovation to the portfolio. For example, within oncology, cancer genomics continues to be a strong growth area for GenPath with several new offerings in 2022.During the fourth quarter, we entered into partnerships with large academic centers such as University of Rochester and the University of Pittsburgh as examples. During the quarter, we also launched a new service for patients that previously received OnkoSight advanced NGS testing. Let me explain. Typically, oncologists order a reduced set of genetic markers specific to each cancer type, about 50. However, BioReference has developed technology that is able to analyze simultaneously all 525 cancer relevant genetic abnormalities. The reanalysis of this comprehensive data set with our analytical software can help physicians who need to look beyond specific small panels to guide their therapy options. By reanalyzing the full genetic panel, it also enables oncologists to better assess the biology of the cancer in their patients and guide either therapy or as we found out, inclusion in relevant clinical trials offered by pharma or biotech company without the need for resequencing an area of great interest and also a new avenue for increased revenues.Our commercial footprint has expanded during the fourth quarter of 2022, with the addition of 8 new oncology sales territories as well as 5 new molecular oncology sales roles, who will focus on our cancer genomics offering in large cancer centers, health systems and large oncology practices.In early 2023, we will be launching new testing to exclude the expanded OnkoSight portfolio and expanding also minimal residual disease portfolio following the very high demand by oncologists for this testing. In urology, we have expanded the commercial team with 5 new urology territories for 2023 growth as well as training and incentivizing our entire sales team on selling the 4Kscore test in all their call points in markets. During the fourth quarter, the urology team brought on 68 new accounts which have promising applications for a fast start to 2023 for growth.In women's health, we continue to build strong relationships with our large practice groups, which continue to expand and create meaningful opportunities as we look forward to 2023. In terms of innovation, in early 2023, we will be launching our new CINtec PLUS cytology testing, which allows physicians to identify women who are at high risk for the presence of cervical dysplasia and who need intervention versus a watch-versus-wait approach. Typically, this test applies to patients who have a negative (inaudible) or some dysplasia but positive HPV virus test. CINtec can then differentiate whether the HPV viruses are active and therefore, dangerous and could lead to the development of cancer and will require intervention rather than yearly or biyearly follow-ups. BioReference will be the first national reference lab with this offering.In terms of the clinical services and hospital services, we continue to expand our partnership with Westchester Medical Center and are commencing our efforts on their outreach business which will lead to growth as we head into the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, we continue to expand our focus in the urgent care sector, expanding our existing relationships, bringing on 20 new offices in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as establishing a new urgent care network in the Northeast.In Q4, we launched a new comprehensive respiratory panel that included the most common viral diseases for the fall of 2022, flu A and B, COVID and RSV. This provided an easy way for clients to order testing with 1 swab and identify which potential virus they needed to treat. This was very well received in the marketplace as we were one of the first national labs to launch this type of panel.We've also expanded our hospital team, focused on new business for 2023 and expanded our clinical team with roles focused on retention of our current business and minimizing attrition.In summary, our vision for BRL is to move BioReference back to profitable growth following the drastic reduction in COVID revenues experienced by the entire industry. And to do so as soon as possible during 2023. I'm very hopeful that these efforts will be apparent to you in the second and third quarter.And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Adam Logal.Adam E. LogalThank you, Elias. Starting with our pharmaceutical segment. Revenues for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022, were [$46 million] an increase of $7.4 million from the comparable period of 2021. Total costs and expenses for the 2022 quarter were $67.9 million, including $16.5 million of noncash intangible amortization. Research and development expenses were $16.6 million, which is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating loss from our pharmaceuticals segment was $22 million for the fourth quarter compared to an operating loss of $14.8 million for the prior year quarter. The increase in losses reflects the amortization of our intangible assets upon the approval of NGENLA earlier in 2022.Moving to our diagnostics segment. We reported revenue for Q4 of 2022 of $139.4 million compared to $362.8 million for the 2021 period. This decline reflects lower COVID testing volumes as the market shifted to rapid at-home testing earlier this year. We continue to execute our Reach expense reduction program, as Elias mentioned. We've reduced our expense run rate by over $140 million and realized benefits from this program in each sequential month during the quarter. As Elias mentioned, we have identified a number of near- and medium-term growth programs that we expect to realize in the first half of 2023, which will help return BioReference to profitable growth.Operating loss for our diagnostics segment was $23.3 million for the quarter, which reflects a sequential improvement of approximately $26.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2021 and we reported an operating loss of approximately $18.6 million.Turning to the consolidated financial results for the quarter. We reported an operating loss of $55.3 million compared to Q4 2021 operating loss of $63.1 million. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 included a $49.1 million noncash mark-to-market adjustment reflecting the decline in value of our equity holdings in GeneDx, formerly Sema4, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $17 million, resulting in a net loss of $85.2 million or $0.11 per share for the quarter. This compares to a net loss of $73.8 million or $0.11 per share for the 2021 period. As we look at the gearing quarter ahead, we are providing financial guidance with the following assumptions.For our pharmaceuticals segment, because the timing is not certain, we have not assumed the approval of NGENLA by the U.S. FDA in our forecast. Approval would result in a milestone payment of $90 million. We have also not assumed the U.S. region for NGENLA will be in the gross profit share.We also have assumed beginning in Q2 2023 that the EU region will shift to a gross profit share from the royalty structure currently in place. We assume Vifor will receive pricing determinations and will launch RAYALDEE in additional EU territories thereby triggering a $7 million milestone payment likely in the first half of 2023.We assume a stable FX rate for our ex U.S. pharmaceutical business as we have seen a 10% impact on our business over the last 12 months. For our diagnostics segment, we assume COVID testing volumes will continue to decline throughout 2023, and we have assumed modest growth in core testing volumes with stronger growth in our higher-margin oncology, women's health and urology specialty lines of testing.We've also assumed the full impact of our Reach program, delivering an additional $30 million of cost savings in 2023 or more than 5% of our total diagnostic spend. Due to the significant variables in our revenue and spending plans outlined, we have limited our outlook to the first quarter and look forward to providing additional updates during our first quarter conference call. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect the following: total revenues between $165 million and $185 million, with revenue from services between $130 million and $140 million; revenue from product sales between $30 million and $35 million and other revenue between $5 million and $10 million. We expect Q1 2023 costs and expenses to be between $230 million and $245 million including R&amp;D expense between $20 million and $24 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $25 million. As we progress through 2023, we expect to enter into at least 1 non-dilutive licensing transaction for 1 of our early-stage programs that Elias described. We will manage our investments in new R&amp;D programs and commercial initiatives to our available cash resources.That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. And now operator, let's open the call for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies.Kevin Harrington StrangThis is Kevin on for Maury. Congrats on the update. I just had a first one on somatrogon. Is there any granularity you can say about what sort of update we could expect this year from Pfizer? And would this likely be a resolution either way? Or could it be a status update? And then on timing, could this be a midyear update? And what are some of the drivers behind potential time lines there?Steven D. RubinThis is Steve Rubin. We do expect some form of definitive communications from the FDA around NGENLA. So obviously hoping for by midyear, but I can't guarantee when that will be, but we do expect that to be a definitive yes or no at that point.Kevin Harrington StrangOkay. Great. And then a quick question for Adam. You mentioned you expect [NGENLA] to shift to gross profit share in Europe. And I think -- I believe 2023, is there any granularity on when that could be and what the gating factors are there to that shift?Adam E. LogalKevin, yes, so we expect -- what requires in the European region to move to gross profit share is for the -- for us to get pricing in 2 additional major markets. We have pricing in Germany. There's -- the other major markets are expected to launch this year. We've guided that we expect them in the first half of this year and in Q2 for the territory to shift to gross profit share.Kevin Harrington StrangOkay. Great. And just a last one for Elias on maybe the ModeX pipeline, just the types of deals or partnerships that you're looking to make there and when we might see an update in that regard potentially this year?Elias Adam ZerhouniSo it depends on each product. And in terms of the portfolio. We've had a lot of incoming interest, both for the multispecific antibodies as well as the vaccine. So we're in active conversations. I hope to see 1 or maybe 2 transactions complete this year, hopefully, in the first half.The structure of it is pretty classic. In other words, upfront plus milestones cash royalties, and this is the dominant type of transaction we're looking for. Others are looking for more long-term collaborations and that can be variable depending upon the scope of the collaboration. But we will also keep some products and attempt to develop them with our own resources because they're very, very valuable.OperatorThe next question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Company.Jeffrey Scott CohenSo I guess to start, Adam, any commentary generally speaking, on the margins, which were better than we thought, any pull-through? It looks like you're balancing back a little on a linear basis?Adam E. LogalYes. So there's a couple of things that obviously, the Reach program had its biggest impact during Q3. So we saw a full quarter of the Q3 exits and reductions that we expected to see. So that was one of the drivers. We also received a $2.5 million payment on the pharmaceutical side of our business from our Chinese partner for the commercialization or development activities that are ongoing in China for RAYALDEE. So those are the 2 main drivers, Jeff.Jeffrey Scott CohenOkay. Got it. And I guess next, Elias, could you talk a little further about this urgent care network and the number of facilities, where they're located, what a typical facility looks like as far as size and scope.Elias Adam ZerhouniYou're talking about the patient service centers? I could hear your question.Jeffrey Scott CohenYes.Elias Adam ZerhouniOkay. So what we did, we did a full analysis of the return on investment, if you will, of each PSC as a system. And what we found is that there are some that really were not either located in the optimal position, some that when you looked at the totality of the revenue and expenses needed to be displaced or closed. And then we opened 11 ones in very promising locations that really attract not just our own clients, but also a volume that we're starting to see whereby you can do what I think our minimum productivity requires, which is 50 to 60 draws a day. With the increase in reimbursement for draws, as you know, we expect then that investment, if you will, and redeployment to be very positive to the revenue line.Jeffrey Scott CohenOkay. Got it. And then could you talk a little bit more about the OnkoSight testing? And how are the payers and the money flows on that?Elias Adam ZerhouniSo the team at GenPath did an excellent job with their approach to the full gene sequencing. And so they are able to do all the 525 tests in 1 run. And the turnaround time that is basically industry best with 3 to 5 days.But as you know, the CPT codes are specific to each -- 1 type of cancer that the patient may have, breast cancer or colon cancer. And so typically, the oncologist -- the treating oncologist requires to reduce that. However, as the patient goes on, first line, second line and so on, there may be a need for readjusting the therapy, understanding maybe what other pathways are really active in that tumor, whether it be liquid tumor or solid tumor. So the there is a demand for going back in 2 areas. One is understanding better the biology of the cancer; and two, figuring out if there is minimal residual disease or not.So we developed 2 approaches. One is to say -- and we have the software for it to look back at the whole set, 525 and inform the oncologist for that particular patient. But what we found is that the highest demand is really for clinical trials in oncology by large oncology practices like U.S. oncology and others. We say we want to participate in trials, but we want to know what are the gene [management], the genetic abnormalities that the pharma companies or the biotech companies are looking for. And so many, many therapies today are developed as a function of the genetic makeup of the cancer that the patient harbors. And this is what we put in place.And now we are going to launch the minimal residual disease test, which will complement our full offering to oncology. I hope that's clear.Jeffrey Scott CohenYes, that's very helpful. And then lastly, I heard a comment about March 20, the complete portfolio analysis. What will that be? And where will that be?Elias Adam ZerhouniI'll let Gary respond, he's preparing there.Gary J. NabelYes. This is Gary Nabel. And we are planning to have the R&amp;D Day as a virtual event. It will be on March 20 at 4 in the afternoon, and we'll be providing the specifics in terms of logging in.At that time, what you'll hear is you'll hear about the evolving portfolio, starting with the multi-specific antibodies, their applications to solid tumors, liquid tumors. We also will cover the infectious disease portfolio, HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and in addition to that, some work on other emerging pathogens.And then finally, as Elias described, the EBV vaccine, what the status is of the programs and what the prospects are for the future. So we're really looking forward to sharing our excitement about the portfolio and really the advantages that our new technologies offer for a variety of diseases.Elias Adam ZerhouniJust as an add-on, Gary, if you allow me, the EBV vaccine is the most advanced in our portfolio and is likely to enter the clinic by the end of the year, beginning of next year as well. It's one of those molecules -- I mean programs that are pretty much going through the last stages of IND approval.OperatorThe next question comes from Edward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler.Edward Andrew TenthoffGreat. Thank you very much for the update and really looking forward to the R&amp;D Day next month. I guess my question has to do just with respect to overseas and really how in NGENLA is doing? Are you seeing competition at this point from SKYTROFA? And how much of a delay do you think in terms of ultimate competition in the U.S. is the head start that SKYTROFA has gotten? How much of a setback do you think that might be for the ultimate market share here in the U.S.Adam E. LogalIt's Adam. I'll start off, and I'm sure others will weigh in. So outside of the U.S. right now, at least in the Japanese markets or Japanese region, we don't expect long-acting growth hormones to enter that market for a few years. In Europe, there is a head start that Pfizer has had on SKYTROFA as well. I think they've -- SKYTROFA won't be launched until the second half of this year in the European market. So there is a good deal of progress that Pfizer has been able to make in that market.As far as the U.S. delay is going, there's -- it's a big market. Payer landscapes are challenging for all new entrants into the market, which is -- which may have impacted SKYTROFA's launch. So we think Pfizer is well positioned once they do have approval to launch in the U.S. So we expect it to be a competitive market. Today, it's fragmented with 7 players in the daily market. So having 2 or 3 competitors should put us in a good spot.Elias Adam ZerhouniJust one more thing, if I could, Adam. In addition to the upside or setbacks, as you asked, -- there is an element that is important. And that is if and when, hopefully, we get approval for the FDA. Our R&amp;D expenses in somatrogon will decrease significantly because we're keeping sites open with extensions as long as we haven't finalized the approval of that. So that will also help in the balance sheet, if you will, of the program. that I don't think is taken into account and maybe Adam can give you the numbers eventually.OperatorThe next question comes from Yale Jen with Laidlaw &amp; Company.I-Eh JenMy first question is in terms of NGENLA selling in Europe, and you will start to have a profit sharing later this year. Do we anticipate either Pfizer or you guys provide some sales figures over those territories to provide more colors.Adam E. LogalSo Pfizer -- I don't know what their plans are to split out NGENLA's revenue numbers. So we wouldn't provide those when it becomes material to the overall financials of OPKO, we would potentially break out the profit share or royalty income that we're receiving from it.I-Eh JenAnd maybe a follow-up question on this point is that I think in the press release, you mentioned that there's all priority markets to be launched this year. Could we give a little bit more color in terms of what [comes] to the priority markets in this statement?Adam E. LogalIt's the major pharmaceutical markets, is the way I would define it.I-Eh JenOkay. And maybe the last question here is in terms of the diagnostics sector -- groups. Could we get some sense of in terms of the headcount from the height of the COVID days to recently as well as -- how does that compare to the pre-COVID days.Elias Adam ZerhouniI can answer that question Yale Jen. At the peak of the COVID, basically at the end of '21, beginning of '22, 8,000. Today, we're 3,300.I-Eh JenOkay. How would that also compare to prior to the COVID?Elias Adam ZerhouniSo in 2019, it was the same headcount, 3,300. And we're still working on it, as Adam mentioned.I-Eh JenAnd maybe just -- sorry.Unidentified Company RepresentativeGo ahead.Elias Adam ZerhouniJust as we to bring the company back to profitability, we are hoping to achieve another $30 million of efficiencies.OperatorThe next question comes from Yi Chen with H.C. Wainwright.Yi ChenFirst question, just to clarify, have you disclosed how much royalty based on sales of somatrogon you have received in the first quarter?Adam E. LogalWe have not broken it out separately. No.Yi ChenOkay. Do you plan to do that at some point in the future?Adam E. LogalYes. So once the number becomes a material number, which you could expect could happen later this year based on the gross profit share shifting or the royalty scheme in Europe shifting to a gross profit and the potential U.S. market coming online.Yi ChenAnd has Pfizer indicated whether -- when there will be an update regarding the U.S. resubmission, could it be first half of this year or second half of this year?Steven D. RubinSo we [don't] know exactly when. Pfizer has a regular dialogue with FDA to approval, and we hope it to be first half of this year, but they haven't provided a specific date.Yi ChenOkay. Lastly, could you comment on the most recent trends of diagnostic volume specifically for non-COVID tests? And whether do you expect the diagnostic segment revenue could resume growth in the first half of this year.Elias Adam ZerhouniThat's exactly what we're working on. And it is actually essentially at the same level as 2019 base -- I'm talking about the core business now. And as Adam said, we're planning on the growth of that core business of about 3%, 4%. But the main growth is going to come from the specialty testing, as I described, in oncology, urology, women's health and also large health systems partnerships, which is in the high single, low double-digit range.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Phillip Frost for any closing remarks.Phillip FrostThank you for your questions and for your interest in OPKO. As you've heard, we are working on all fronts. There's great interest in the progress of NGENLA. And your questions about what's forthcoming in the United States are of great interest, of course. And you can be sure that Pfizer working with our team address the questions that were raised by the FDA, and we hope that -- we think that they were answered in a very positive, favorable way. We hope the FDA agrees with us.And so far as the rest of the business is concerned, as it was pointed out, we have a lot of work to do, but we're working diligently with the BioReference business to bring it back to where it should be and where we think it will be. And so far as RAYALDEE is concerned. We didn't talk much about it, but you can be sure that we're working very hard to increase the revenues and profitability, and we're enthusiastic about the work that our partners are doing on the product as well.So I'll leave you with that and hope that as many of you as possible will participate in the R&amp;D event on the 20th of March, and we look forward to again meeting with you to discuss the first quarter results. Thank you and have a good evening.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Fox’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Fox What's The Opportunity In Fox?Great news for investors – Fox is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $57.68, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Fox’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Fox?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Fox. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since FOXA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FOXA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy FOXA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about Fox as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

""The CHIPS and Science Act presents us with an opportunity to make investments that are similarly consequential for our nation’s future.”Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductors at the White House in September. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Raimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.The speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works— and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.""Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,"" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America’s national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.Story continuesIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law ""the most significant competition policy in our generation."" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.The overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the “premier destination in the world” for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that “every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.”'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'The Biden administration’s challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.The situation is even worse with the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.Raimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. ""That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,"" she said.President Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Raimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.“Our success will be short-lived"" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&amp;D is what will make it a longer term success.""It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,"" she said.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added ""as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.""The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Return on investment? National security. Raimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.She noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy’s 1961 call—and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The next step in the administration’s plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo’s department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. “It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,” Raimondo told reporters.The speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.""I expect to be held accountable,"" Raimondo said.Meanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.Raimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.""Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,"" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country.

For more oil stocks, head on over to 5 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The oil and gas industry is one of the most important and lucrative sectors in the world. This is simply due to the nature of the product itself, with the marvels of internal combustion ensuring that whether it's transportation or power generation, some of the most crucial sectors of the global economy remain dependent on fossil fuels.Naturally, this criticality within the global economy also lends the industry some high valuations. For instance, a research report from Maximize Market Research outlines that the global crude oil market was worth $1.3 trillion in 2021 and from then until 2029 it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% to be worth an estimated $1.6 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that growth in the global population along with developments in the petrochemical and agricultural sectors will drive the industry forward. It adds that both Asia and North America will outpace the broader industry in terms of growth since the pair will each exhibit a 1.9% CAGR.Right now, the crude oil industry is battling to figure out what impact a Chinese economic recovery will have on the industry. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that while oil prices will increase to $100 per barrel, this will only happen in December this year due to higher supplies from the U.S. and Russia, longer winters, and a Chinese reopening. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), on the other hand, believes that oil demand this year can grow by a whopping 36%, based almost entirely on Chinese strength.Today, we'll take a look at which oil companies are popular with hedge funds, with the top picks being Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Story continues15 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashOur Methodology We used Insider Monkey's collection of 943 hedge fund portfolios to determine which oil companies they had invested in as of the fourth quarter of last year.Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15.

219,f2eb7a1e-bc56-3857-9132-460807cdeb41,MPC,2023-02-24,Should You Invest in Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-marathon-petroleum-mpc-based-143002910.html,1677162602,STORY,['MPC'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marathon Petroleum (MPC) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Marathon Petroleum currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.64, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.64 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MPCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MPCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Marathon Petroleum here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Marathon Petroleum, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness.

Thank you for attending today's MP Materials Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results. My name is Tia, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Martin Sheehan, Head of Investor Relations with MP Materials. You may proceed.Martin SheehanThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. Welcome to the MP Materials Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today from MP Materials are Jim Litinsky, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Rosenthal, Founder and Chief Operating Officer; and Ryan Corbett, Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation, earnings release and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's earnings release and the appendix to today's slide presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim?Story continuesJames Henry LitinskyThanks, Martin. And thank you all for joining us today. Let me start with an overview of today's call. I will begin with the highlights of the year. Ryan will then review our financials and KPIs, Michael will then provide an update on our Stage 2 optimization at Mountain Pass. I'll return with a brief update on our Stage 3 magnetics business and some closing comments, and then we'll open it up for Q&amp;A. So let's get started on Slide 4. Since founding MP in 2017 and in our 2-plus years as a public company, we have been unwavering in our mission to restore the full rare of supply chain to the United States, and we made substantial progress on our mission in 2022 and so far in the early part of this year. Operationally, the team executed. We produced and shipped a record volumes again in 2022. Mining and ore delivery outperformed our updated mine plan. Maintenance teams stayed focused and relentless, which was reflected in outstanding uptimes. The Stage 1 operations and engineering teams continued to drive improvement in mineral recoveries while also increasing our feed rate into the mill. Execution at this level requires lots of unsung heroes working in tandem, taking on challenges, anticipating future ones and ultimately, thinking like owners. So to the entire MP team, we stayed safe, and we had another excellent year. Great job, and thank you. For 2022, the price of NdPr oxide and therefore, our concentrate product improved nicely versus the prior year. The combination of better realized pricing and the record volumes produced by the team resulted in a 59% increase in revenue and a 77% increase in adjusted EBITDA. The Stage 1 business generated $353 million in normalized Stage 1 free cash flow. That is a 67% cash flow margin just for the Stage 1 business. The Stage 1 business, therefore, generated more cash flow than our entire capital expenditures for the year, most of which consisted of our significant downstream investments towards Stage 2 refining and Stage 3 magnetics. We believe these transformational moves to achieve our downstream mission will improve our profitability, reduce the volatility of our business and significantly expand our long-term enterprise value. Our ability to pursue such an important and exciting opportunity while self-generating the resources needed to do so is amazing. More importantly, it means we continue to maintain our fortress balance sheet with over $1.2 billion in gross cash and roughly $492 million of net cash at year-end. In a rising cost of capital and bifurcating economic environment, platforms with a high return on capital opportunity set and a capital structure like MPEs are scarce. But as I always say, we must execute, and I am proud of what the team has achieved recently. We started commissioning our Stage 2 assets late in the third quarter and began producing roasted concentrate in the fourth quarter. These were critical first steps in the complex Stage 2 commissioning process. We also advanced the heavy rare separations project at Mountain Pass with continued progress on the front-end engineering design and long lead procurement. To remind you, the heaviest project is the one where we were honored to receive a $35 million grant from the Department of Defense, which was announced live by the President of the United States himself last February. Next, our Stage 3 magnetic efforts are accelerating. Recall that at the end of 2021, we reached an agreement to supply General Motors with NdPr alloy and magnets to support their entire Ultium EV platform. We signed the GM definitive supply agreement and also broke ground on our initial magnetics facility in Fort Worth early in 2022. We have made rapid progress and our goal remains to begin delivering alloy to GM late this year, followed by magnets in 2025. And finally, earlier this week, we announced a distribution agreement with Sumitomo Corporation. Japan is the largest producer of neo magnets outside of China and thus, the largest market for refined NdPr products outside of China. Sumitomo will serve as our exclusive distributor of NdPr oxide in Japan and we will collaborate with them on the supply of rare earth metals and other products. We believe this agreement is an important and beneficial development as we now position for Stage 2 sales. There were many other success stories of the company throughout 2022, including the extension of our positive environmental and safety record, the creation of over 120 new jobs in California, Nevada and Texas in support of our mission and the publishing of our inaugural ESG report. All in, we have been busy. I will have more on Stage 3 and market view shortly. But first, let me turn the call over to Ryan to run through our financials for the year and quarter. Ryan?Ryan S. CorbettThanks, Jim. We'll turn to Slide 6. And as Jim highlighted, 2022 was another very strong year of operations for the company. Our production volumes increased for the fourth year in a row to a record 42,499 metric tons of REO in concentrate. The operations and maintenance teams continue to perform with our uptimes remaining at roughly 95% for the second year in a row. In addition, we continue to improve our throughput while optimizing our mineral recoveries. We believe there is incremental room for improvement here, but in the near term, the majority of our focus is on commissioning our Stage 2 assets. We shipped a record 43,198 tons of REO in concentrate during the year, a 2% increase over 2021. The increase was generally due to the timing of shipments. As a reminder, concentrate shipments have generally tracked our production volumes over time. Moving forward, there will be some lumpiness as we transition to Stage 2 products, which I will discuss in a moment. On the top right chart, you'll see that our realized price per contained REO time increased 55% to $11,974, driven primarily by the strong demand for NdPr feedstocks in the market. Despite Chinese macro volatility over the course of 2022, continued EV penetration supported rare earth pricing. Lastly, on the bottom right graph, our production costs when excluding the ramp in expenses ahead of our Stage 2 commissioning increased a little over 5%. Despite some fairly significant inflation in 2021 and 2022, we were able to increase production efficiencies enough to maintain a fairly flat cost per ton for our concentrate. Note that this operational KPI, as reported, focuses purely on our concentrate business. So we will evolve these KPIs over the course of 2023 as we ramp our downstream products. Moving to Slide 7. On the top left, you will see revenues increased 59% to $527.5 million driven by the PxQ effect of both higher realized prices and slightly higher shipment volumes. And given the significant operating leverage we get from higher pricing, you will see on the top right that our adjusted EBITDA increased 77% in the year. That impact is also shown on the bottom left graph, where our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 8 percentage points to 74% in 2022. And finally, on the bottom right, the significant impact of this leverage creates on adjusted diluted EPS, which increased over 102% to $1.68 per share. I will discuss some discrete tax items that impacted Q4, but for the full year, our strong earnings demonstrate both our enviable operating leverage and cost structure but also our strong tax position as a domestic producer of critical materials, which will only get better as we transition to Stage 2 and take advantage of some of the benefits of the IRA bill. Moving on to Slide 8. and our fourth quarter operational KPIs, you will see in the bottom left that our production remained strong in the quarter, up 2% versus last year at 10,485 metric tons of REO. Keep in mind that we have a regular 1-week maintenance shutdown early in the fourth quarter, which was the driver of the 4% decline in sequential production. Sales volumes on the top left increased 12% versus last year's fourth quarter and 1% sequentially, again, simply driven by the timing of shipments. We mentioned last quarter that we would ultimately be diverting about 2 weeks of inventory into the Stage 2 circuits or a little under 2,000 metric tons, which would occur over several quarters. So while we began this process in the fourth quarter, the impact was not material to our sales in the quarter. As Michael will discuss in a moment, we will have some roasted concentrate available for sale in Q1, but we do expect to begin more significant charging of our circuits as Q1 progresses. Moving on to the top right, you can see realized pricing albeit very solid at $8,515 was down compared to both Q4 2021 and Q3 2022. About half of the year-over-year decline was due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange as the yuan weakened versus the dollar. In addition, Chinese COVID lockdown and the impact on the Chinese economy likely reduced demand for NdPr slightly. Looking at the volatility in the price of NdPr over the last year from a high of approximately $175 per kilogram and a low of $83, it's very important to note that fairly modest changes in supply and demand can move the market price fairly substantially. This is one of the reasons we are so confident in the long-term growth trajectory of our business. Given forecast of NdPr demand over the next decade or so are 3x today's output. The challenge of the world producing enough rare earths to keep up with this demand is clearly a favorable indicator for NdPr pricing over time. I'd note that some of the positive leverage we saw in concentrate realized prices as NdPr prices went higher in recent quarters ended up going in the opposite direction as prices decline. This is in part driven by the variability in the implied discount we have to take in selling an intermediate feedstock to refiners overseas. While this effect will be moot once we are selling our own separated products, it's important to note that the realized price growth or decline in our concentrate sales over the course of this year. As always, will outperform as NdPr market prices rise and generally underperform as they decline. And of course, there is also the timing and volume of shipments, which impacted our average pricing in any given period. Moving to the bottom right graph, you will see that our production cost per metric ton increased 26% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, driven by the timing of maintenance costs during the quarter as well as higher payroll expenses, including an increase in employee headcount to support the expansion of Stage 2 operations and the impact of cost of living adjustments, which we talked about last quarter. The year-over-year comparison was also impacted by higher fuel costs as well as the recommissioning of our CHP plant at the beginning of the year, which is running suboptimally until we get to full Stage 2 power demand. Excluding the Stage 2 related costs, Stage 1 production costs were roughly $1,600 per ton in the quarter, impacted by the same factors just discussed but primarily driven by the timing of maintenance events across our mining fleet and our crushing facilities, which we view as discrete. Flipping to Slide 9. On the top left, our revenue declined 6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year as the 12% increase in shipping volumes was more than offset by a 16% decline in the realized price shown on the previous slide. Similarly, our quarter-over-quarter revenues were impacted by a more significant decline in sequential realized pricing. And on the top right graph, while adjusted EBITDA declined 23% year-over-year, mainly due to lower realized pricing, we still produce a very solid $55 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. And although not on the page, $32 million in Stage 1 normalized free cash flow. The lower realized pricing also flowed through to our margins, which were nonetheless a healthy 59%. Importantly, on the bottom right, you will see that our adjusted diluted EPS increased 40% over last year's fourth quarter and 17% sequentially. These changes were driven by 2 factors. The first was the impact of the higher interest rate environment on our strong cash and short-term investment balance. In the quarter, we generated nearly $11 million of interest income versus virtually 0 a year ago. These totals show up on the other income net line of our P&amp;L, which you can find in the appendix of our slide deck or in our press release. The second factor was a large tax benefit in the quarter. The timing of new assets coming into service for GAAP purposes drove a change in the full year effective tax rate, which was recognized in the fourth quarter. We generally benefit from material tax deductions, including foreign-derived intangible income and depletion in excess of basis. which we had initially forecasted would not apply for this tax year but indeed end up providing us permanent tax benefits recognized in 2022 in addition to the temporary benefit of bonus depreciation on the assets we did place in service. Note that the timing of certain assets entering service, they continue to drive some volatility in book and cash tax rates as we complete our investment program. Absent this impact, I'd expect our tax rate to remain in the high teens until our geographic mix materially shifts. Turning to Slide 10. We generated $353 million of normalized Stage 1 free cash flow in 2022. As Jim mentioned earlier, that more than covered the $308 million of growth CapEx during the year which covered the significant completion of Stage 2 as well as material investments in the Stage 3 building shell, engineering and early equipment costs. Very little spend remains in 2023 for Stage 2 with the overflow as discussed in prior calls, relating mostly to timing of payments. Importantly, our strong cash flow this year has allowed us to keep all of our powder dry, even as we've made tremendous progress on our mission. We expect CapEx this year to be roughly in line with 2022 with about $300 million in expected growth capital primarily supporting Stage 3 and in addition to our other growth projects. From an earnings perspective, as we have talked about for some time, 2023 will be a transition year. As we work to ramp the separation facilities, we will continue to sell concentrate into the market with the revenue and cost profile you are used to seeing. Michael will discuss our commissioning progress in more detail in a moment. But as it relates to our annual results, I continue to expect Stage 2 separated product sales to begin in the second half of the year and be back loaded, in part because there will be added time to recognize revenue as we build out our sales channel and qualify products with customers. These sales would also initially come with a lower margin profile ahead of us scaling to run rate volumes and profitability. And of course, some of our initial production will be shipped to Texas to begin the metal making process, delaying the actual recognition of sales until we deliver the end product to General Motors. Importantly, we will continue to prioritize the long-term and make the right investments in our Mountain Pass people and processes in 2023 to support separated product production for decades to come. In addition, we expect to grow our headcount and spending for Stage 3 with revenue for magnetic products not far away. Regarding cash flow, we discussed our spending plans a moment ago, and have already flagged the working capital investments we expect to make as Stage 2 ramps. On that note, we are thrilled about the distribution agreement we announced Tuesday with Sumitomo to facilitate oxide sales into Japan and we'll continue to invest in broadening our geographic reach as our markets grow. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael for a more detailed update on our Stage 2 progress. Michael?Michael Stuart RosenthalThanks, Ryan. It has been productive and fulfilling a few months of operation and commissioning though, of course, not without its challenges. On the Stage 1 operational front, during the quarter, we experienced considerable external headwinds from construction, commissioning and weather. But our teams have done an excellent job remaining focused and we were able to achieve continued improvement in mineral recovery at the mill. Circuit uptime was slightly below the prior year but exceeded our conservative estimate. We made good progress in pre-commissioning and initial commissioning activities of Phase 2. This also included completing the remaining upgrade and pre-commissioning work of legacy circuits that are now already for use. We completed our first quarter operating the new concentrate filter, dryer and roaster, a great picture of which is shown on Slide 11. Broadly speaking, this process is playing out as previewed last quarter with certain expected challenges proving easily resolved, a large number of instrumentation nuisance issues that are also easily resolved, a certain proportion of known, unknown that have readily identifiable resolution timetable. A few reliability issues that will be worked out over time and then a small number of unexpected issues that generated the greatest heading. Through it all, we made great progress. The primary process equipment is running quite well and many of the initial bugs that are in the rearview mirror. Even as we experiment with and tuned the equipment, we are able to consistently produce roasted concentrate that meets our desired specifications. The initial testing of the roasted con suggests that it should achieve the leach yield and serum rejection that we are targeting. This is critical to our cost competitiveness and production throughput. Initially, the vast majority of this product will be sold. But as the subsequent circuits in the flow sheet have brought online, more will be directed or invested towards making oxides. There are a handful of remaining issues that we are addressing before we are able to run at our full desired run rates through the calciners. But we will continue to attack these over the coming months as we had full steam into commissioning the balance of the Stage 2 assets. As we approach the end of the first quarter, we have commenced commissioning all the remaining Stage 2 assets, so of course, some are further along than others. The most critical next step is putting into operation of leach circuit. This includes legacy equipment that will be operated under new process conditions alongside newly installed equipment and processes. Continuing the process flow, the impregnated leach solution will then pass through legacy purification and separation circuit. The legacy equipment have already completed their recommissioning activities, while new additions are currently being commissioned. As with leach we expect a period of troubleshooting and rebalancing when the new feed begins to flow. The last circuits in the process will be NdPr finishing, a portion of which can be seen on Slide 12. I will reiterate that commissioning is and will be a nonlinear process. It is a series of 2 steps forward and 1 step back. As it pertains to our production ramp target, we would not expect commercial scale production of NdPr oxide yet in the first quarter, but we look forward to providing additional updates on our ramp on the Q1 earnings call. It is important to remember that the start-up of any one circuit does not determine the timing and ramp towards the final run rate of production. Certain circuits will be commissioned and troubleshot quickly and reach our desired run rates of production, certain others will overcome problems but take longer to ramp up throughput. And others will achieve run rate production easily but struggle with reliability and uptime. All in all, however, we remain confident in our targets. We are more excited than ever to be putting 4 years of planning on Stage 2 into operation. While we expect 2023 to challenge us to a greater extent than any time since 2018, I remain extremely confident and proud of our team and look forward to progressing and communicating our production ramp in subsequent calls. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.James Henry LitinskyThanks, Michael. Turning to Slide 13. We -- this is a recent aerial picture of our Texas magnet manufacturing facility. You can see a lot of construction activity, and most of that action is now taking place inside the building, given that the shell is complete. Since we last talked in November, most of the key public utility infrastructure has been installed, gas, water and with electrical finishing up shortly. We are also beginning to see some of the long lead equipment arrive, including the HVAC systems, which are now being installed. And the procurement of other long lead production equipment continues. We also now have a fully functioning magnet research lab in place, enhanced by a number of key recent hires and with more to come as we continue to expand the team. Our magnetics team should all be able to move into the new Fort Worth facility by late summer. If you look closely in the picture at the top right of the facility, you will see where sizable office and lab space connects into the factory. Our goal is to make this site the center of the most cutting-edge magnetics efforts in the world. To update you on the market and conclude the prepared remarks, I would like to reiterate that I remain bullish on the outlook for our business. In 2022, despite an overall market contraction, global sales of passenger EVs climbed more than 50% to approximately 10.3 million units. There has been a profound global search and EV adoption and action in the United States, which has trailed China and Europe, is accelerating rapidly on the back of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and a dramatic increase in new models available to consumers. And bear in mind that EVs are just one of several downstream applications driving growth. We also see growth and opportunity in wind turbines, robotics, consumer electronics and even power tools. When you put this all together, looking out to 2035, with analysts predicting a threefold increase in demand for neodymium magnet and strong corresponding growth for NdPr. A threefold increase in NdPr demand would mean the world likely needs the equivalent of more than 15 Mountain Passes coming online over the next dozen years. Keep in mind that Mountain Pass is one of the largest producers of rare earths in the world today. Assuming such economically viable ore bodies were identified and cleared multiyear permitting processes, it would still take years and multiple billions of dollars to bring that supply to market. Therefore, even though the macro economy will usually drive short-term volatility in pricing, we remain convinced that there are huge tailwinds for our sector. MP's in-place assets are, therefore, extremely valuable. And our vertical integration strategy, coupled with our fortress balance sheet, will enable us to leverage all aspects of our platform to create additional value. With that, let's open it up for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.Matt J. SummervilleA couple of questions. I guess I wasn't aware that between Stage 1 output and actual oxide that there would be an intermediary product in the form of roasted concentrate available for sale. Can you talk about what sort of quantity we might be looking at over what kind of time frame? And how much value does that particular process step add to Stage 1 output, i.e., how is that priced in the market? And then I have a follow-up.Ryan S. CorbettSure. Matt, it's Ryan. I can take that, and then we'll have Mike talk a little bit about roasted con and what it means for us and our progress. As it relates to the roasted concentrate there's not a material difference in economics in terms of selling price vis-a-vis the incremental cost of getting through the roasting step. And in fact, the way I would think about the available volumes is it's not going to be a material departure from what you've seen in terms of regular concentrate sales over the next quarter or so. As we mentioned, we should be -- and we are all preparing for incremental volumes to begin charging the downstream circuits over time. But this is a relatively short stop on the way to production of finished oxide products. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit about roasted con and what that means for the process?Michael Stuart RosenthalSure. Thanks, Ryan. Producing high-quality roasted con may be the most important single step in ensuring the cost competitiveness of our separation and finishing assets. So the production of roasted con is an important -- a very critical transition point for Stage 2. But in itself as a product itself is not the aim. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the initial testing on that roasted con give us really high confidence that the yield that we'll get out of that when we proceed into leach, any yields of getting NdPr recovery and rejecting the serum, which is a critical part of our process are going to be in the ranges that we're targeting. And this is really important for reducing reagent expense and improving the quality of the feed that goes to the purification and separation stages. They're also minor energy savings and maintenance savings from that as well. So it's an important product, but not necessarily an important long-term sales product.Matt J. SummervilleUnderstood. And then just as a follow-up, one of you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're feeling more and more confident about incremental mineral recovery coming out of Stage 1, but maybe taking a pause on that for obvious reasons as you're renting Stage 2. Timing-wise, how should we be thinking about when you can go attack that opportunity? And I guess how much upside relative to the output you generated in '22? Could we be looking at based on your domain knowledge at this point around that?Michael Stuart RosenthalThis is Michael. I'll take that as well. I think I've mentioned this in the past before. We do have a lot of optimism that there's significant opportunity to improve the way we do things in our flotation process, our beneficiation process and the results of that. We have a team, growing team dedicated to that effort. We have continued to work towards that irrespective of the progress at Stage 2, so that's not hindered by the progress. Maybe some of the implementation could be impacted just by overall distraction, but we're pressing ahead with that. And I think there'll be incremental steps, incremental progress. We hope at some point, there's a greater progress, but we can't exactly predict the timing. Some of it is just incremental process improvement and some is more small investments that we believe could have a significant improvement. Hopefully, that addresses your question mostly.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen.David Adam DeckelbaumCongrats, Jim, Ryan and Michael. First, I just wanted to start off on the Sumitomo agreement. Obviously, a landmark agreement, trying to understand, I know it's early, but if you could give any sort of guidance around the potential volumes that could be sold here? Should we think about this as sort of consuming all of the available on NdPr oxide that you would have for sale not consumed in the Stage 3 operations for now. And then would there be an inherent premium that you would expect in terms of pricing relative to what you would sell into China?Ryan S. CorbettSure, David. It's Ryan. I'll take that. Obviously, we're pretty excited about our deal with Sumitomo, an important step, as you mentioned, to our also market in Japan, which, as you know, is the largest magnetic center outside of China. The way I think about this agreement is it's a distribution agreement. This is a relatively proven and efficient way to get to market in Japan. I think it's pretty clear that there's a growing need for diversity in Japan sourcing. And so what we see is with their desire to grow production and our view of an expected demand-supply imbalance coming in the market. We and Sumitomo are confident there's going to be a fair amount of demand for our upside there. So overall, it's an exciting first step for us with a major player in the market, as we talked about, certainly an opportunity, hopefully, to expand the relationship over time. I think the other thing I'd say on the economics part of your question, as you've heard from us just a minute ago, we certainly believe in the demand picture in our market. And so we do expect to transact on market-based prices. And so importantly, I'd say the terms that are offered to the end customers in Japan remain in our control. We haven't locked ourselves into any particular model. And so from that perspective, we'll continue to do what's best for the business.David Adam DeckelbaumAnd I have a maybe kind of a follow-up for you. You talked in your prepared remarks about the IRA benefits. I know perhaps 10 days ago, the treasury kind of defined what would be eligible under 48C. Can you give us a sense on the line of what you think is eligible at this point in terms of your capital being spent on expansion projects for 48C? And what you would certainly see on the production tax credit side and when you might think that the timing of those benefits would be realized?James Henry LitinskyDavid, it's Jim. So we're watching all of the 48C stuff like you are as well. It's still preliminary. There you have to -- the government is coming out with stuff and then there's going to be a period of submitting. And so it's still early to make sort of any kind of specific predictions or thoughts or guide you as to how we're thinking about that. Obviously, we're watching it very closely.Ryan S. CorbettThe only thing I'd add on this 45 -- yes. Just real quick on 45x.David Adam DeckelbaumIt's 45x, Ryan, you wanted that?Ryan S. CorbettYes. The difference there being obviously different being a production tax credit versus based on capital. And so from everything we see, I think the guidance there is a bit more clear and straightforward, and we will be producing a product that we believe clearly qualifies into the 45x framework. And so as we ramp our ore oxide production, we expect to start benefiting from that by default as we produce those products.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Corinne Blanchard with Deutsche Bank.Corinne Jeannine BlanchardJust trying to understand better maybe what could be 1Q and maybe the cadence of production, sales and EBITDA for the year. And I know you don't give defined guidance, but maybe if we go from consensus, how comfortable do you feel with the straight at minimus flat price I think you mentioned obviously going through a transition and having maybe lower margin towards the end of the year. So just trying to frame your cadence for the year.Ryan S. CorbettSure. Corinne, this is Ryan. I'll take that. What I would say is our expectation, obviously, that we laid out in our prepared remarks was that you should expect us to begin the transition to oxide sales in the back half of the year. Obviously, there'll be a little bit of a gap between as we bring production online versus when we're recognizing those sales into the P&amp;L. And so we wanted to importantly make that distinction. I think to your point, as we look out at the way several folks have modeled the business, one of the reasons we flagged to you all the margin profile is, certainly, we feel, as Michael laid out, after the results that we've seen from our roasted concentrate, we're more confident than ever and what our eventual yields and results will look like as we get to run rate. But the important thing to keep in mind is just we've said this over and over again, 2023 is a transition year. So you can't expect our first kilogram of oxide to come out at the same cost profile as the kilogram that's coming out once we hit run rate. So from that perspective, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. I'd say that while we make the transition, certainly, we've got our concentrate business and the roasted concentrate business in the background. But we'll continue to build the team and get operators online, ready for production and commercial production of Stage 2 as we get further into the year. So those are sort of the puts and takes from a production and sales perspective.Corinne Jeannine BlanchardGreat. And then sorry, if I missed it also, but did you provide any commentary on the market itself, like in terms of like China pricing and kind of maybe where you think it could go over the next 6, 12 months?James Henry LitinskySure. I'll take that. So we don't typically provide any commentary on pricing just because it's -- ultimately, it's a commodity, and it is volatile. I think China has been -- it's been really tough as it always is to read the tea leaves in China because it's China. And in particular, given the opening post-COVID as well as your Chinese New Year and all the moving parts. And I think if we look at the markets over recent months, there was sort of some excitement just in advance of the Chinese opening with the expectation that there would be sort of an explosion of growth out of that and then sort of a pullback around New Year and sort of maybe a settling in as far as sort of the world figures out what it means. My guess is that some of the things driving pricing in the very short term are probably the noncritical areas for the long term. And what I mean by that is -- and I just think you might find it helpful, Corinne, if you listen to -- if you remember in my prepared remarks, I referenced analyst research that kind of talked about the market for NdPr in magnetics being 3x the size it is today by 2035. And that's actually for people who are interested, it's -- that's not my data that's an Adamas Intelligence research report kind of looking at the rare earth magnet market outlook. What's really interesting about that and the reason I mentioned it is that if you look at the market today for NdPr demand in the growth, what are the current high-growth areas, which, of course, there will be some others, but in EVs and wind turbine. That today is only a little under 20% of the overall demand, and the rest is kind of standard things in general auto or consumer electronics or some of the others. And so that other 80% might be -- some of it will be much more volatile impacted by the economy in the short term. But then if you think about the 20%, and I think many have heard me say this before, but if you think about that 20% that is the ultra-high growth, growing -- compounding at, say, 30% a year or whatever. As you look out a decade from now, just those areas get you to maybe 3x the market in 15 years from now or so. That today, let alone the fact that, that other 80% that's kind of like a GDP influence area also may have some other areas that are high growth like robotics or power tools or so again, my guess is that the very short term is that we've sort of seen a very weird Chinese opening and sort of general malaise in the economy. But the areas of growth that we think are critical for long-term pricing and even by long term, I mean just a couple of years out, or through all of this we're growing extraordinary. And so we feel really confident that that's a great trend for us.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.Carlos De AlbaCongrats on the progress. A couple of questions. Just coming back to the Sumitomo agreement, is there any color that you can give regarding, is this agreement take or pay? Are there any specific volumes attached to the deal? Any color that you can provide there would be useful. And then, my second question, it is around CapEx. So $300 million guidance for this year, similar to 2022. I think I remember you mentioning that $700 million was a comprehensive CapEx that you saw for Stage 2 and Stage 3. How do you see then the overall $700 million balance, it still remains in place? Or has there been any shift on that number?Ryan S. CorbettCarlos, it's Ryan. I can probably hit both of those quickly. In terms of the Sumitomo agreement, this is a pretty standard type of distribution agreement. And so volumes and pricing is going to be market-based in consultation with our end customers. As I talked about, clearly, there's a desire and need for incremental volumes and diversity in Japanese sourcing. So we are confident there's a fair amount of demand for our upsides there. .And so ultimately, as I think you're probably referencing some of our existing distribution agreements, ultimately, over time, we're going to have different contract terms and contract types. And so ultimately, that's the most efficient way for us to sell into the Japanese market at this point. As it relates to your CapEx question, what I would say there is in terms of the overall $700 million guide, which you are right, that was an all-in number thinking about the completion of Stage 2, bringing online the Fort Worth facility as well as the heavy rare earth separation facility at Mountain Pass. And so if you take that $700 million that we guided you to, I guess, almost exactly a year ago, I would say, in terms of what we see in those projects, other than sort of the normal inflation that I think everybody has seen from materials and things like that, there are no material departures from that guidance. So we still feel good about that number. And so you saw that of the CapEx we reported this year, about $308 million was growth capital for this year. We're talking about another $300 million in 2023. And so we continue to expect to be on track with the investment program that we communicated to you guys.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord.George GianarikasSo recently, China, according to certain press reports has begun restricting the export of several technologies related to, NdFeB magnet production and rare earth refining. And I'm curious as to whether you think that will impact your ability to make magnets here in the United States.James Henry LitinskySure. George, so no, we don't think that will impact our ability at all. We've been focused on this mission for quite some time. You certainly see the pictures of where we're at, and we have a long way to go, but we've got a really incredible team. And I think if anything, it just speaks to the importance of what we're up to and how important it is to have diversity in the supply chain for no other reason in that single point of failure risk. But to directly answer your question, there's no specific magnetic technology that we're counting on out of China or anything like that. So it should have no impact on us.George GianarikasAnd as a follow-up here, I'm sure you've noticed that there have been it seems like every day, there's an announcement of some OEM or some larger company taking a stake in or outright buying mines related to lithium or other metals. And I'm curious as to why you think we haven't seen that flurry yet when it comes to rare earth material and whether you think that's possibly on the comment. And I will give you some credit here that this is something that you talked about over the last couple of years is happening and it's finally here, but we haven't really quite seen an impact of your sector yet. Any thoughts there will be appreciated.James Henry LitinskyYes, sure. Great question. I mean, as you know, I've kind of been talking about this for a while, what I call the AOL-Time Warner moment of the auto supply chain where people realize that these worlds need to collide. I think it's still early innings. So when you say it's here, I mean, I think that this is sort of a just beginning process. I would argue, as far as rare earths, I mean, the practical reality is that there aren't that many parties out there. Lithium is pretty widespread around the globe. So our copper, nickel, some of the other commodities that you might think about. But with rare earth, you know who the key players are. And I think we executed our definitive agreement with GM about a year ago. And so certainly, GM is now -- has recognized the space and it's very early. And as I've said repeatedly, we've had conversations with lots of OEMs. Our deal is not exclusive, and we expect to build a bigger, broader magnetics business. So I think the answer to your question is it has touched the rare side. I think what's a little bit unique about us is that we have a remarkable asset that we are cash flowing today. So in some of these other deals, you have essentially greenfield sites that need a lot of financing. They need to get potentially government capital, other equity capital. And so some of the deals that you may see are offtake/financing type deals, and every deal is going to look different. But so for ours, we're obviously very proud and excited of the deal we have with GM. And I think you'll see a ton of -- a big variety of deals in this space. And yes, certainly, you're seeing some of the same rumors that we're seeing. But I think all roads lead to -- it speaks to the value of the franchise that we're building. So we're obviously excited to see all that. And obviously, it feels really good to have predicted something happening and seeing it come true. And I'll continue by saying that I just -- I think that you're going to see a lot more of that.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Baird.Benjamin Joseph KalloAlong the same lines that I just -- Jim, I guess, for you. How do you think about offtake agreements? I know that you guys want to maximize the value before signing offtake agreements. But just with the volatility you saw this year and all the OEMs coming in, you're locking up lithium or other materials. Has anything changed in your view on the long-term agreements?James Henry LitinskySure, Ben. I think it connects into -- and I think I can expand on what I was saying a little earlier. But offtake, there's a variety of offtake agreements. And so I think some of the recent deals you might be seeing, it's always hard to tell what component of that offtake is a financing versus what component of that offtake is just offtake, right? And I think the good thing about the strong position that we're in with the fortress balance sheet that we have is that we don't need to view offtakes as any form of financing, right? We can be totally agnostic as far as that goes, we can look at in offtake or any kind of structure as what is the highest return maximizing value option for shareholders. And so as I've said from the very beginning, we'll continue to do that. And we're in a really good position. And I think, particularly in our space, and maybe I should have touched on this earlier, but we'll -- because of the platform that we have, I do think -- and maybe it's a little early but maybe not. We're going to have some exciting opportunities, given our platform to be in situations where maybe sort of earlier expectations of things didn't work out so much and we can kind of come in and provide solutions. And so I think that's sort of an exciting opportunity for us, but we're seeing such an early stage of growth in the space that who knows. But I would also just say, obviously, I kind of say this repeatedly, and I appreciate that, but we'll -- we're not going to telegraph those before they happen. So if we do something, you'll see it announced, we're not going to sort of say, hey, we're pursuing this offtake or that offtake or whatever, we're going to -- you can imagine behind the teams we're having conversations, and trying to do the best that we can do to create value. And it's exciting.Benjamin Joseph KalloAnd Michael, you mentioned the lead team a couple of times, but if we think about the flow chart from the dry roasting to separation that leads in between, I think, is there one more difficult step than other? I think you said this in your opening statement there, but I think separation gets people tripped up. Is that wrong? Or what do you worry about most, I guess.Michael Stuart RosenthalI think, It's important that we do the leaching right if we want the other parts to be stable. But I don't think I would say one part is easier than another. Obviously, they all ultimately have to work the way we need them to, we're optimistic about all. We're very excited to be proceeding with leach the way we think it should be.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America.Lawson WinderNice quarter. Maybe just one question for me. The research center. I mean, developing a cutting-edge magnets research center in Fort Worth, in a matter of years sounds very, very exciting and also potentially very expensive. Maybe you could give us an idea of what like the annual run rate cost of running a cutting-edge research center would be? And then, are there challenges in the staffing side?James Henry LitinskySure. Well, the good news is there's nobody positioned really in the Western world, really outside of China to lead in this effort. So unlike a lot of areas that might be sort of more competitive out there in the world, given our set of assets. We have that unique position where we can, as I like to say, talent begets talent, scale begets scale, we're sort of in the early days of this. And so it's an extraordinary opportunity. As far as where the -- getting the talent, I mean, the good news is if you're in metallurgy or magnetics, MP is the place to be, right? We had a lot of talent that's reached out to us. We've brought some incredible talent on board. We'll continue to do that. And lastly, what I would say is, I mean, with this cost, it is nothing compared to the opportunity. And I hope that we've at least earned the right to have you believe us when we say that we are maniacally focused on shareholder value. And we're not looking for a research project. We're looking to create a magnetics champion. And so everything that we do is geared towards that. And when we think about research, these are not -- this is not like a think tank. This is research oriented towards creating a franchise that's going to be enormously valuable in the decades to come. So it's a great question because we do ask ourselves that question. Every person that we hire, every penny that we spend, but it is a commercially focused resource organization. And I'm very confident that, over time, will yield extraordinary returns from that investment. But it may take some time, right? This is very long lead stuff. And so you'll -- those impacts are in the company today, they'll be in the company in the near term, but I'm very comfortable that they're going to pay off in many, many multiples and be -- we'll be glad we did it.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Abhi Sinha with North Capital Markets.Abhishek SinhaI think Ryan touched upon this, and I apologize if I missed it. I just wanted to get the production cost in terms of dollar per ton, the $1,928 figure, how should we think about like how keep up as we move on 2023 as you get better efficient CHP or how should that flow? And what should we be looking at the run rate for the production cost as we move forward?Ryan S. CorbettYes. Sure, Abhi. What I would say is, we don't provide specific forward-looking guidance, but just to give you some color on what's in that number. So looking at the reported metric that you mentioned a moment ago, the largest drivers there, as you'd expect, are costs related to Stage 2 that find their way into COGS even at this point before we're producing. And so for example, certain personnel expenses as we build the team, you mentioned at the combined heat and power plant that is running suboptimally until we've got the full Stage 2 power draw. But one of the things we talked a little bit about last quarter was our gas hedge position and a significant portion of that did not come into effect until January 1. So we were exposed on some gas prices and California gas prices with all the weather there, for a good portion of our burn in Q4. And so that had an impact that we don't expect to repeat. I guess, pulling the onion back a little bit more and just trying to pull out the cost that I just mentioned that are not related to Stage 1. The Stage 1 stand-alone costs were closer to $1,600 in the quarter, a little bit higher than what we normally see in the $1,400, $1,500 range and that was predominantly due to 2 items that showed up in the quarter. Firstly, an impact from just really timing of maintenance. As we've talked about, we take our biannual plant shutdown in the fourth quarter. And in addition, in this fourth quarter, we incurred some costs in relation to maintenance activities on our crushing facilities as well as our mining fleet. And so those just kind of happened to hit all at once with enough scale to kind of be noticeable in the quarter. But when you look at the frequency and scale of these events over time, the cost burden of those are generally captured and what is kind of our more normal run rate cost. So if you look at the adjusted Stage 1 only cost growth year-over-year over the course of the whole year, which is in that mid-single-digit range. I think that is much more representative of the Stage 1 business. But as I mentioned, of course, the cost related to Stage 2, as we get closer to Stage 2 ramping, we'll continue to pick up a bit as we bring new heads on board, new maintenance team members and things like that. So hopefully, that gives you some color on the moving parts than what you expect.Abhishek SinhaSure. And then just one more, if I could. You talked about in terms of production volumes. That was like being adversely impacted by some lower feed grade and mineral recoveries, I just wanted to get some color on that, if you could elaborate like where you're getting lower feed grade and mineral recoveries. What's about that?Ryan S. CorbettYes. I think maybe you might have misheard part of that. What we saw in the quarter actually was slightly lower feed grade but improvements in mineral recoveries. And so I would say when you put all of the moving pieces together Obviously, looking at the results, there was not really a meaningful or material change from our overall sort of production cadence. And so, we don't expect anything particularly material to change here over the next year or so. Michael gave a nice idea of the various items we have in the hopper, hopefully tackle mineral recovery and improve what we believe it certainly won't pass levels over time, but nothing really material to report there.OperatorThe last question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.Laurence AlexanderJust a couple. One is, can you talk a little bit about how you expect staffing to evolve over the course of this year and then over the next few years and where that would take your SG&amp;A to once you have the magnet production up and running, once you finish the vertical integration? And secondly, as you've been discussing with various customers about to move into magnet production, is the expectation or the baseline for discussion about any potential agreements that you would have a return on capital at current magnet prices or (technical difficulty) the current market to get an adequate return on the capital you will be investing?Ryan S. CorbettSure. I can take that. So in terms of the growth in staffing, I wouldn't attribute all the growth in staffing certainly to SG&amp;A. What I would say is that a significant portion of the staffing that we expect to bring online for Stage 3 as we get closer to production, we'll eventually find a way in production cost. In the early days, there'll be -- they won't find their way into COGS. But to give rough numbers, in hiring plans at Stage 2. So at Mountain Pass, we'll probably bring another 60 to 75 people on board over the next year for Stage 3, it will probably be shy of 100 incremental folks. So hopefully, that gives you just a rough sense, but I would just caution on sort of attributing all of that to one particular line item in the P&amp;L. On your second question, Jim, do you want to start off on that one?James Henry LitinskyYes, sure. Laurence, point blank, and very clearly, we have said consistently over time that we look at the Stage 2 and 3 businesses as separate businesses that certainly benefit that we're on the same platform, but that we have to make sure that incremental investment has a very attractive risk-adjusted return on capital. And so we have no interest in shifting money from the Stage 2 business to the Stage 3 business and lose capital as I like to say, we're not going to rob Peter to pay Paul. .What is great about our platform, though, is that it does allow us to think holistically about the verticals. And ultimately, where and how we choose to structure whatever deals may be, we're going to think about the fact the baseline of, okay, well, we have a commodity in Stage 2 that we can sell at a market price, how should we think about this incremental opportunity? And if that incremental opportunity is attractive, that is how we're going to think about it. So I want to reiterate that, that is of the utmost importance to us because we -- as you've heard me say, we think like owners, we're large shareholders. So we want to make sure that any growth in the business is driving value. We're not in it for charity.OperatorThank you. I will now hand it back to the management team for closing remarks.James Henry LitinskyYes. All right. Well, thank you, everyone. Congrats to the team, it's a great quarter and a great start to the year, and we will get back to work. So have a great night, everyone.OperatorThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

It sold 1.2 million trucks across the United States in 2022, according to the company's latest annual filing.The Indiana facility builds full-size trucks, including Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.Newspaper The Detroit News had reported the production halt on Wednesday.

This compares to earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility holding company would post earnings of $0.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of 20.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.PG&amp;E , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $5.37 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.25 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PG&amp;E shares have lost about 4.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4%.What's Next for PG&amp;E?While PG&amp;E has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PG&amp;E: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.26 on $6.11 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.24 on $23.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Full-year 2022 revenue saw a decrease of 9.8% to $418.9 million. However, CEO Ethan Brown said the brand is ""making solid progress"" in its ""transition to a sustainable growth model, one that emphasizes the achievement of cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023.""Here's what Beyond Meat reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, per Bloomberg consensus estimates:Revenue: $79.9 million versus $75.7 million expectedAdjusted earnings per share: -$1.05 versus -$1.18 expectedBeyond Meat is focused on its three primary pillars, Brown said, including driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction, bringing inventory levels down while generating cash flow, and placing a ""greater emphasis on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while also supporting strategic key long-term partners and opportunities.”At the end of October, Beyond Meat announced plans to reduce expenses and target cash flow operations within the second half of 2023, which coincided with the announcement of a 19% cut in its workforce.In the release, Brown said the fourth-quarter results ""clearly demonstrate delivery"" of the plan it set out last fall, ""including solid sequential progress on margin recovery and operating expense reduction, and continued inventory drawdown.""Standouts of the fourth quarter, per the release, include industry notoriety received from innovations like Beyond Steak, in addition to the launch of plant-based McPlant Nuggets in Germany earlier this week. That offering is part of it three-year partnership with McDonald's (MCD), which is now days away from its two-year anniversary. Back in September of 2021, McDonald's announced its plan to test its first-ever plant-based burger, the McPlant.Story continuesIn the release, there was no mention of the status of its partnership with KFC (YUM), Beyond Chicken.As far as retailers, right now, Beyond Meat is offered at Kroger (KR), Walmart (WMT), Publix Super Markets, Costco (COST), Whole Foods (AMZN) and Target (TGT).SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 14: In this photo illustration, a McDonald's McPlant Beyond Meat burger is displayed with french fries at a McDonald's restaurant on February 14, 2022 in San Rafael, California. Nearly three years after Burger King and Carl's Jr. rolled out meat-free burgers, McDonald's has debuted its McPlant burger made with a Beyond Meat vegetarian patty. For a limited time the burger is being offered at 600 McDonald's restaurants across the country. (Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)For the full year 2023 outlook, the company expects net revenue to be between a range of $375 million to $415 million, a decrease of 10% to 1% compared to 2022. Gross margin is expected to be in the low-double digit range. It expects to incur $250 million in operating expenses, ""weighted slightly more towards the first half of the year.""The company did note ""unforeseen impacts"" that could impact the company's results including ""near-term uncertainty related to macroeconomic issues,"" such as inflation and rising interest rates, ""demand in the plant-based meat category, increasing concerns about the likelihood of a recession, increased competition, supply chain disruptions, challenges related to labor availability and, to a lesser extent, COVID-19 and its potential impact on consumer behavior and demand levels, among other things.""This comes as demand for plant-based meat overall is lower, as customers trade-down for cheaper protein options amid inflation.Brown said he remains focused becoming cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023 and on the long-term outlook for the brand as it ""navigate(s) current conditions.""He said, ""We remain intently focused on positioning Beyond Meat to capture the vast opportunity to be a major protein provider in the $1.4 trillion meat industry.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP and CSX Corp. CSX.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2057915/3-railroad-stocks-to-watch-from-a-challenging-industryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry is suffering from headwinds raging inflation, higher interest rates, high fuel price and supply-chain disruptions. Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corp., Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and CSX Corp. appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Deciding the Industry's OutlookDividend Hikes Signal Financial Bliss: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. In 2023, CSX upped its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share.High Oil Price Hurts Bottom Line: Even though oil price has declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Naturally, operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty: The hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than anticipated in January, has highlighted the fact that we are far from being out of the woods and that inflation remains a formidable foe. CPI was up 0.5% in the first month of the year, following a 0.1% rise in December and compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise.Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 3.2% on a month-on-month basis in January. In fact, the index has declined month on month for five consecutive months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183. This rank places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 8.1% since February 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry.

Here are two stocks investors may want to consider buying with earnings approaching.Ross Stores (ROST) First up is Ross Stores, which is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 28. As an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, Ross Stores has found a niche among the Retail-Discount Stores Industry which is currently in the top 31% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Ross Stores stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with earnings estimates trending slightly higher for fiscal 2024 as the company wraps up its FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview &amp; OutlookRoss Stores Q4 earnings are expected at $1.23 per share, up 18% from EPS of $1.04 in Q4 2022. Plus, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Ross Stores could beat bottom-line expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q4 EPS at $1.27. On the top line, fourth-quarter sales are expected to be $5.13 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss Stores is now expected to round out Fiscal 2023 with earnings down -12% at $4.30 per share compared to EPS of $4.87 in 2022. However, FY24 earnings are expected to rebound and jump 15% to $4.95 a share.On the top line, total sales are now forecasted to dip -1% in FY23 but rise 7% in FY24 to $19.86 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be 32% above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $14.98 billion. Performance &amp; Valuation Despite being down -4% year to date, Ross Stores stock is still up +23% over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -8% and the Retail-Discount &amp; Variety Markets -4%. Even better, over the last decade, ROST is now up +282% to easily top the benchmark and roughly match its Zack Subindustry’s +292%.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, at its current levels, Ross Stores stock is still intriguing going into its quarterly report. Trading at $111 per share, ROST trades at 22.8X forward earnings which is near the industry average of 21.8X. Ross Stores stock also trades well below its decade-long high of 84.3X and closer to the median of 21.2X.Urban Outfitters (URBN) Another retail stock that looks intriguing going into its Q4 earnings report on February 28 is Urban Outfitters. The fashion apparel retailer also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) going into the quarterly release with earnings estimates rising for fiscal 2024 as the company rounds out FY23.This is a good sign that Urban Outfitters apparel, accessories, footwear, home décor, and gift products are continuing to attract consumers despite inflation and a pullback in non-essential spending.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview &amp; OutlookThe Zacks Consensus for Urban Outfitters’ Q4 earnings is $0.39 per share, down -5% from Q4 2022. Sales for the quarter are expected to be $1.36 billion, up 2% from the prior year quarter.Rounding out its fiscal year 2023, Urban Outfitters’ earnings are now forecasted to drop -44% to $1.75 a share followng a stellar year that saw EPS at $3.13 in 2022. However, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rebound 31% to $2.29 per share. Sales are now projected to be up 5% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $4.93 billion. Fiscal 2024 would represent 25% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $3.95 billion.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationUrban Outfitters stock has rallied +10% YTD to slightly outperform the broader indexes and the Retail-Apparel/Shoe Markets +9%. Urban Outfitters -35% performance over the last decade has significantly trailed the benchmark but topped its Zacks Subindustry’s -58%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith that being said, Urban Outfitters’ performance over the last year has outpaced the benchmark and its Zacks Subindustry and this could continue when looking at the company’s valuation.Trading at $26 per share, Urban Outfitters stock trades at just 11.5X forward earnings and nicely below the industry average of 13.3X. Plus, Urban Outfitters stock trades 94% below its decade high of 197X and at a 26% discount to the median of 15.5X.Bottom Line Rounding out their fiscal 2023, Ross Stores and Urban Outfitters stock look attractive from a P/E valuation standpoint relative to their past along with earnings estimates rising for fiscal 2024. This is a positive sign that both companies may be able to offer better-than-expected guidance which has been crucial for more upside in retail stocks as high inflation is still affecting consumers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SFM is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Mar 2 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1,558 million, indicating an increase of 4.3% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this grocery retailer is also expected to increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share has been stable at 37 cents over the past 30 days, indicating an increase of 15.6%.Sprouts Farmers has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Phoenix, AZ-based company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 17.3%.Factors to NoteSprouts Farmers' focus on product innovation, technology and targeted marketing with everyday great pricing bodes well. It has been steadily expanding its presence in the natural organic space, given the huge demand in the segment. Management has been lowering operational complexity, optimizing production, improving the in-stock position and updating to smaller-format stores. Apart from these, the company has been trying to expand private-label offerings.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSprouts Farmers Market, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSprouts Farmers Market, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. QuoteCumulatively, the aforementioned factors are likely to have favorably impacted the top line. On its last earnings call, Sprouts Farmers guided comparable store sales growth of nearly 2% for the final quarter against a decline of 1.1% reported in the year-ago period. The company guided earnings in the band of 35-39 cents a share compared with 32 cents a share in the year-ago period.Sprouts Farmers is focused on creating a robust omnichannel experience. The company has been providing hassle-free shopping through the Sprouts.com website and mobile app and creating a supply chain that provides the freshest produce. We note that an in-store Pick-up &amp; Delivery facility is available to all customers across all stores and markets. Such initiatives have been helping the company expand its customer base and revenues.Despite these tailwinds, high labor costs, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues remain concerns. These might have weighed on the company's margins.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sprouts Farmers this time.

The Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have all touched down between 3-6% from their January peaks.The VIX Index, commonly referred to as the ‘fear gauge’, has spiked more than 20% in the past month. The VIX generates a 30-day forward projection of volatility. It is derived from the prices of SPX index options and represents expectations for short-term price changes in the S&amp;P 500.In other words, the market is expecting price ranges to widen in the near-term, which is a common theme when stocks are falling. While not always the case, normally volatility is low or trending lower as stocks rise and typically trends higher as stocks fall. The old market adage speaks to this - stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.One area of the market that has been navigating the volatility and leading the charge this year is semiconductors.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.Mark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 21 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics.The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.Brendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We finished up an outstanding 2022 with another very strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2022 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $609.6 million and cash site leasing revenues were $600.5 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $800,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a benefit of $2.2 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.1% net over the fourth quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn.Story continuesOn a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 9.3%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis, including 3.5% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was not as strong as the third quarter, but still solid. We saw meaningful and balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. Full year organic leasing contributions to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our outlook provided on our prior earnings call. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity and new leases each represented 50% of our domestic bookings.The big four carriers of AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we again experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. We still expect to incur this churn and have incorporated our reduced 2022 domestic churn amount into our outlook for 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 7.6% of churn or 13% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again with similar results to our strong third quarter. 2022 was one of the strongest years in the company's history for international gross leasing activity or bookings.In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contribution from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to the third quarter and as anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due primarily carrier consolidations and Digicel's previously announced exit from Panama. During the fourth quarter, 78.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $485.9 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.4% or 90.9%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $460.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.1% in the quarter, again, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues and pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.1%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business had another very strong quarter, with $76.5 million in revenue and $19.3 million of segment operating profit.We finished 2022 with our most successful services year in company history as measured by both revenue and profit by a very wide margin. Services backlogs remain very healthy at year end, although off the record high hit earlier in 2022. Our fourth quarter services results were again primarily driven by T-Mobile and Verizon. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the fourth quarter, was $340.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.12, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2021. AFFO results finished ahead of our prior outlook, but were still negatively impacted relative to our outlook assumptions by our early refinancing of $640 million of secured tower revenue securities in November at a higher interest rate than the retired debt. During the fourth quarter, we meaningfully expanded our portfolio acquiring 2,642 communication sites for total cash consideration of $736.7 million, which included 2,632 sites acquired from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for approximately $725 million.During the quarter, we also built 162 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 31 sites all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $23.2 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the year, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years. The land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2023.Our outlook reflects continued year-over-year growth across our leasing business, including an increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments largely due to the strong new leasing activity we experienced during 2022. We also forecast significant revenue growth contributions from non-organic additions, primarily as a result of having the assets acquired from GTS in Brazil in our results for a full year in 2023. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2023. Domestically, the increase is mainly in connection with the anticipated Sprint-related decommissioning, some of which we had previously expected in 2022. Due to the timing shifts of some of these decommissionings, including during the fourth quarter, we are now including an estimate of $25 million to $30 million of Sprint-related churn in our full year outlook.Mangostar/Shutterstock.comOur previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. Internationally, our outlook includes increased churn as well, including carryover impacts from Digicel in Panama and carrier consolidations in Central America. In addition, our international churn includes approximately $10 million associated with an agreement we have entered into TIM Brazil, to address their consolidation of a portion of Oi Wireless. This agreement has accelerated certain turn impacts with us in exchange for longer-term business commitments from TIM, and we believe positions us well for a long, mutually beneficial relationship with TIM. Our 2023 outlook does not include any other churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation.But if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to this that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. With regard to our Services business, our full year 2023 outlook reflects the year-over-year decline in revenues and adjusted EBITDA contribution but starts ahead of where our 2022 outlook started. If not for the phenomenal 2022 services results, our outlook for 2023 would represent the best year for services in our company's history. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to have very healthy services backlog. And as a result, we expect another very strong year for this business. The outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today and also does not assume any share repurchases.However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2023, but it does assume we deploy excess cash into repayments of our outstanding revolver balance. Under this assumption, we would end the year with leverage in the mid 6x area, but we project that we would still incur approximately $36 million of increased net cash interest expense compared to 2022. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $109.6 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited about 2023. Our customers remain active, and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals.Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to take just a moment to discuss the succession plan announced this afternoon. I'm truly honored to have been entrusted with the leadership of this tremendous company. I've had the privilege of spending the last 25 years at SBA and spending all of those years working closely with Jeff as the company has grown significantly under his leadership. Jeff has been a great friend and mentor to me and I look forward to continuing to have his counsel as Chairman of the Board. I'm very excited about the future of SBA. We have an amazing business that is part of a great and still growing industry. Our financial strength and very talented leadership team position us well to be a critical support to our customers and to capitalize on many future opportunities.I greatly look forward to working with the rest of the SBA team to continue rewarding shareholders and building upon the company's great legacy. With that, I'll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on the balance sheet.Mark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of total debt and $12.8 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, which is below the low end of our target range, notwithstanding our significant Brazilian GTS acquisition during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 4.7x. During the fourth quarter, the company through an existing trust issued $850 million of secured tower revenue securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028 and a final maturity date of November 9, 2052. The fixed interest rate on these securities is 6.599%. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the entire $640 million principal amount of our 2018 1C tower securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of March 2023 as well as to pay certain amounts outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.Subsequent to quarter end, we continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $585 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.0%. The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital to repay amounts outstanding under revolver as a result of the GTS acquisition. We currently have $504 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at December 31, 2022, were 108 million compared to 109 million at December 31, 2021, a reduction of 0.9%.In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on March 24, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong end to one of the best operational years in our history. For the full year 2022, we beat the midpoint of our original full year guidance for revenue by almost 8% for AFFO per share by 5%. We grew our tower portfolio by over 15%, including entering into a new market in Tanzania, which has gone very well. We had a very strong year for lease-up, including one of the best ever internationally. Our Services business had its best year ever, beating the midpoint of our original outlook for services revenue by 46%, and we grew and expanded our relationships with our largest customers worldwide, setting us up for a bright future. During the fourth quarter, our domestic same tower leasing revenue growth was the highest of the year.All of our largest U.S. customers remain busy during the quarter with relatively balanced contributions from each of them as they continued adding equipment to sites in support of the deployment of new spectrum bands. As evidenced by our full year 2023 outlook, we expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again this year, and we expect all of our largest customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment during 2023, although perhaps at levels slightly below the peak periods of activity we experienced in 2022. Each of the largest U.S. carriers still have significant remaining network needs. So we are confident we will see solid activity on our domestic power portfolio for years to come.Internationally, we ended the year with another very strong organic leasing quarter. During the fourth quarter, 60% of new business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 40% gain through new leases. International leasing activity was ahead of our internal expectations and led by strong contributions from Brazil, South Africa and Tanzania, our largest markets. In 2022, Brazil had, in particular, a very strong year. Lease-up in Brazil for the year was well ahead of internal expectations, and we also had a larger-than-anticipated contribution from CPI-based escalators. We realized material portfolio growth in Brazil, primarily as a result of the GTS acquisition for which the integration is going very smoothly. The foreign exchange rate fluctuations have stabilized over the last year and were actually a slight tailwind to our 2022 results.As Brendan mentioned, we recently entered into an agreement with 1 of the 3 major carriers in Brazil to address Oi consolidation issues in our broader long-term relationship, and we may do something similar with our other major customers in that market. We believe there are great opportunities for future growth in Brazil, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options as the driver. One item we are watching in Brazil is always recent filing for injunctive relief from some of their debt payments. We currently expect that Oi must and will continue to pay their operational vendors, including rents to tower providers. And to date, we have had no collection issues. Our financial exposure to Oi is much reduced given the recent sale of most of their wireless operations to the other 3 mobile carriers in Brazil, with Oi representing approximately 3.5% of our total international revenue.Our sites are critical to the operation of Oi's network, and we have very long-term leases. As a result, we will likely see a little impact from this latest filing. However, we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely. Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. During the fourth quarter, in order to address the nearing maturity date, we completed a new 5-year ABS offering. And while the interest rate was higher than we would have liked, we were very pleased with the significant level of demand for our offering. We continue to be a preferred issuer with extremely good access to capital. While we have good access to additional debt capital, we will be very thoughtful this year when considering issuing incremental debt in the current rate environment, which would only be done for a compelling use of capital, similar to our Tanzanian GTS acquisitions in 2022.With completion of this refinancing, we now do not have any debt maturities until October of 2024. We finished the year with 93% of our debt fixed, keeping us largely insulated for the time being from significant interest rate fluctuations. Even with the GTS acquisition, we ended the year with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range. The strength of our operations and balance sheet and the steady growth in our cash flow allowed us to once again announce an increase of nearly 20% in our quarterly dividend. This increased dividend still represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO and our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments.The strength of our business and capital structure was recently recognized by the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's. Since our third quarter earnings release, S&amp;P increased our corporate rating to BB+, only one notch below investment grade. While a good development, we do not, however, have a specific goal of being an investment-grade company. Should we continue to use AFFO to pay down our revolver and reduce leverage, that would be a tactical choice to generate a guaranteed return to the higher interest rate environment compared to other uses of capital and not a change in our long-term views on the use of leverage. We would be building capacity and biding our time for the next opportunity to issue incremental debt at more attractive rates. We believe the stability and financial strength we offer provides shareholders strong opportunities for additional value creation.I want to end on our succession news. The Board and I have been working on succession planning for several years. We appropriately considered the pros and cons of an external search versus the appointment of an internal candidate as our next CEO. Brendan has, for many years, been growing as the leading internal candidate to be our next CEO with increasing internal and external responsibilities. We are confident we have made the right call. Brendan is an extremely talented executive, equally adept with internal and our external matters, strategy and shareholder value creation. His knowledge of SBA and our industry are without equal. He's well known and respected in the investment community. SBA has an extremely bright future in his hands, and I get to remain very involved and invested in that as the future Chairman of the Board.So a little bit about my decision. It's been very difficult, as you can imagine, given my love for involvement with SBA for more than 25 years. But the reasons are very simple. I turned 65 this year. And I've reached a point in life where I want to do some things while I still can, but I can't do while running SBA full time. Things like spending more time with family, a growing number of grandchildren, travel, spending more time at our home in South Carolina and charity work, very basic reasons that I believe we all consider at various times in our life. With these things vying for my time and attention, it became clear that now is the right time to turn over leadership to Brendan and the next generation of our exceptional leaders. As you can see from our fourth quarter results and full year 2023 outlook, I am retiring at a time when SBA's financial help and prospects are extremely strong.I want to thank all of you on this call or otherwise that have played a role in SBA's success over the years. We have accomplished a lot, and it certainly has taken the work of many. I consider myself extremely fortunate have had the opportunity to lead such a talented group of individuals as we have at SBA, and to have been able to interact and build relationships with a much larger group of customers, constituents, friends, business partners and others who have all contributed to our success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.See also 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks and 11 High Growth Utility Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

250,d7f8c586-23a7-34c9-8db8-ebf7b79c45b9,V,2023-02-24,Why Investors Should Add Visa (V) Stock to Their Portfolio?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-investors-add-visa-v-183806841.html,1677177486,STORY,['V'],"[Visa Inc. V is well-poised to grow on the back of increasing business volumes, investments in digital technology and strategic acquisitions. Also, the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel can be a major boon for Visa.Visa continues to benefit from improving payments volume and processed transactions, contributing to the top line. However, increasing operating expenses will keep putting pressure on its margins.Visa, a leading digital payments company with a market capitalization of more than $415 billion, offers a wide range of in-house payment products, which can be leveraged by its financial institution clients. Moreover, Visa delivers core business solutions and credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs to different account holders (individuals, businesses and government entities).Return on Equity (ROE)Return on equity, a measure reflecting how efficiently a company utilizes shareholders’ money, was 50% in the trailing twelve months, better than the industry average of 37.6%.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceVisa currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Year to date, the stock has gained 6.2%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 5.3%.Estimate Revision &amp; Earnings SurpriseThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has moved 1.6% north in the past 30 days, reflecting analyst optimism. During this period, it has witnessed 11 upward estimate revisions against none in the opposite direction.Visa beat on earnings in all the last four quarters, the average being 8.6%.Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc. Quote Key DriversIn 2022, a significant portion of V’s gross revenues came from data processing which will keep improving on the back of processed transaction growth and improving payments volume.Visa’s unwavering focus on transforming consumer spending habits from cash to cards and digital platforms is evident through its continued innovation in the Consumer Payments Space. While Visa’s core products drive most of its growth, it has also ventured into contactless payment solutions, such as Tap to Pay, Tokenization and Click to Pay to provide a seamless user experience. Through Tokenization, Visa is aiming to leverage blockchain technology by enabling more secure transactions through the use of cryptographic information.Story continuesIts net revenues grew by 12% year over year in first quarter fiscal 2023. As the travel-related cross-border volume continue to recover, stability in payments volume and processed transactions and constant growth in domestic spending will contribute to further growth. With China lifting Covid-related restrictions and persistent modest improvements in the U.S. business, Visa shows improving prospects for its future results.Visa is one of the most profitable companies around the globe. Thanks to its lucrative business model, V is expected to stay ahead of the competition amid the current market volatility. The company believes that consumers have shifted their spending from goods to services, promoting resilience in its revenue from debit cards. With debit and credit remaining resilient, Visa’s overall payment volumes have been stable.Visa’s focus is fixed on improving business organically, then growing through mergers and acquisitions along with dividends and buybacks. With Visa’s strong footprint in the payments space, it works with about 650 co-brands around the world, increasing its reach to the end consumer. Visa’s focus on strategically investing in growth areas is praiseworthy. In fiscal-year 2022, Visa acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (CurrencyCloud), enabling financial institutions to provide innovative, cross-border foreign exchange solutions. Visa also acquired Tink, which is an open banking platform enabling Visa’s clients to build financial products and services.Visa’s strong brand helps deliver value to its clients and financial institutions, through attractive brand expressions. Visa has partnered with FIFA, Olympic Games and the NFL, making it the only brand in the world to be a top sponsor. This trend of marketing will not be slowing, as Visa aims to expand and diversify its range of partnerships for the benefit of its clients.Visa’s strong and in-depth multi-layer security and its continued focus on keeping the clients’ or consumers’ data safe are remarkable. Visa also invests heavily in its comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.The company returned $4 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in first quarter of fiscal 2023. Hence, Visa is a good buy for an investor looking for returns in the form of dividends.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that are impeding the stock’s growth lately.Visa’s operating expense was $2.8 billion for first-quarter 2023, showing a 25% increase year over year, mainly due to higher personnel expenses and litigation expenses, which are bothering its profits. Even though Visa’s Client Incentives were lower for the first quarter of 2023, it is likely to rise in future as the amount paid by Visa to grow payments volume and increase product acceptance will rise as part of its expansion.The Russia-Ukraine war impacted Visa’s data processing revenues and will continue for the next few quarters due to a lag in recognition of the service fee revenues. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Some Other Top-Ranked PlayersSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader business services space are Diebold Nixdorf DBD which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Envestnet ENV and Fiserv FISV presently carry a Zacks Rank #2.

That realisation, however, came too late, the committee said.""Gas extraction in Groningen was so successful and lucrative for the Dutch government, Shell and Exxon Mobil that they hardly took any notion of the long-term risks and the ever-clearer signs of the detrimental effects for the people in Groningen,"" the committee said.""The interests of the people in Groningen were structurally ignored.""The committee estimated gas profits had delivered 363 billion euros ($383.84 billion) to the Dutch treasury since production started in the 1960s, laying the foundation for the Dutch welfare state, while Shell and Exxon's profit was about 66 billion euros.The committee said the Dutch state and the oil companies must finally make good on their debt to the people of Groningen and that Prime Minister Rutte had failed to live up to ""empty promises"".

The index is expected to be up 0.4% from a month earlier, compared with 0.3% the previous month.Story continuesClose Brothers Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer, Robert Alster, said markets were upbeat about the strength of consumer spending in many of the major economies at the moment but also wary about inflation staying higher for longer and extending the rise in interest rates.""That is why were are all hanging on each data point,"" Alster said. ""There is a feeling it is going to be volatile, a bit like being cautiously optimistic skating on thin ice"" he added. ""We are virtually neutral now on all asset classes.""UNWELCOME ANNIVERSARYWall Street was pointing lower again having ended a topsy-turvy Thursday in positive territory for the first time in five sessions, although it too remains on course for its worst week of the year.The expectations that U.S. interest rates might need to rise for longer meant the dollar index, which measures the top world currency against six of its main peers, was up 0.25% at a seven-week high of 104.859. On Thursday, an unexpected fall in new claims for unemployment and a revised uptick in the fourth-quarter PCE price index, suggested some lasting strength in the world's largest economy.""The U.S. dollar index should extend its rise towards 106 if today's U.S. PCE deflators lift the US Treasury 2Y yield above the 4.5-4.75% Fed Funds Rate range,"" said analysts at DBS Bank.A year on from Russia sending its troops into Ukraine, the focus remained the loss of life and long-term geopolitical implications, although the spillovers of the war have had a major impact on financial markets.Aaron Dunn, co-head of value equity at Eaton Vance, said the most obvious had been the sharp increase in oil and gas and agricultural prices when the war broke out. Notably though, most of those moves have been completely reversed.""You have basically retracted a fair amount of the gains in most of the energy markets in the back half of 2022,"" Dunn said, highlighting that the slump in natural gas prices following a mild winter meant gas use was now replacing coal again in Europe.""That has helped the global economic picture,"" he explained. ""The big question is now the top line, the economic performance, and in that respect China's reopening will play an outsized role in the direction we go from here.""The overnight comments from BOJ head-elect Ueda on Japan's easy-money policy had seen Japan's Nikkei share index close up 1.3%, while its five-year government bond yield eased to 0.235%.Ten-year Japanese bonds didn't trade on Friday due to thin liquidly, after breaching the upper limit of the BOJ's policy cap for two straight days. But the yen turned choppy as data also showed core consumer inflation hitting a 41-year high, keeping pressure on the BOJ to phase out its stimulus programme.Meantime, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3%, for a hefty weekly drop of 2.5%.In particular, Chinese blue chips tumbled 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 1.6% after comments from U.S. officials that Washington would increase the number of troops helping train Taiwan's forces.In the bond markets, the key Treasury yield, or the cost for the U.S. government to borrow in the international debt markets, eased to as far as 3.8590% before climbing back to 3.9101%.Benchmark European yields flip-flopped too, dipping after Germany, the bloc's industrial power-house, said its economy shrank by slightly more than initially predicted in the fourth quarter of 2022.They popped up again ahead of U.S. trading though with Germany's 10-year government bond yield last up at 2.49% having hit a 2011 high earlier in the week after stronger-than-expected euro zone PMI data.In the oil market, Brent crude futures rose 0.8% to $82.84 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was also up 0.8% at $75.99.Gold was fractionally higher at a spot price of $1,824.89 per ounce although it was on course for a fourth straight weekly drop.(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Robert Birsel and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

And thanks to Europe's mild winter, brimming storage and gas substitution, yearend natural gas prices are back to where they were 11 months ago - down more than 31% so far in 2023.But it's the pickup and stickiness in underlying ""core"" prices, excluding energy and food, that is irking the central banks and the Federal Reserve most of all.And if the world economy is gathering some steam again in 2023, as recent numbers suggest, interest rate policy may have to be a lot harsher than everyone has assumed.Alongside another tight U.S. weekly jobs report, markets got another glimpse of those price pressures on Thursday.The Commerce Department showed inflation increased much faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter of last year, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure that the Fed favours accelerating at a 4.3% pace compared with prior estimate of 3.9%.The revisions to prices were led by used and new motor vehicles and fees for nonprofit hospital services.Friday gets a more updated monthly view of core PCE from January and it's not yet clear if quarterly revisions affect the standing consensus forecast for an easing of the rate to 4.3% from 4.4% in December - still more than twice the Fed's target.Markets are now braced for three more quarter-point rate hikes from the Fed to at least 5.25%-5.50%, with no cut fully priced from there by yearend. At 4.71% on Friday, two-year Treasury yields are close to cycle highs.Story continuesAlthough cheered on Thursday by chip designer Nvidia's blowout earnings and upbeat outlook, S&amp;P500 stock futures are back in the red - barely clinging to the pivotal 4,000 point level.And increasingly buoyed by the still intense geopolitical fallout from a year of the war in Ukraine, the dollar pushed higher yet again.Whether China now backs Moscow militarily as well as rhetorically is seen as one of the biggest global questions surrounding the war 12 months on and would mark critical juncture in Western relations with Beijing too - and in trade globalisation more generally.China's offshore yuan fell to its lowest level of the year against the dollar on Friday.The dollar also rose against Japan's yen on Friday, with the Nikkei's 1% gain bucking the dour weekend mood elsewhere, after comments by the incoming Bank of Japan chief.Even though data showed Japan's core consumer inflation hitting a fresh 41-year high in January, Kazuo Ueda insisted the BOJ must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the fragile economy, warning of the dangers of responding to cost-driven inflation with monetary tightening.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. January personal income and spending, PCE inflation indices, January new home sales; Kansas City Fed February service sector survey * Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, Fed Board Governor Philip Jefferson, Boston Fed chief Susan Collins speak.

256,eddc36ee-b33e-3773-adbf-382d83bc0fb9,MAR,2023-02-24,"GRAPHIC-One year of war in Europe: How the dollar, energy and food prices swirled",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-one-war-europe-dollar-093644481.html,1677231404,STORY,['NG=F'],"[LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted economies and markets around the world, from energy and food prices to European banks, emerging market stocks and the Russian currency.Below are five charts that show how Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two has shaped global financial markets in the last 12 months.1/THE SAFEST OF SAFE HAVENSThere are many reasons why king dollar reigned supreme in the past year and one is its status as the ultimate safe haven at times of uncertainty. The economic fallout of the war, which hit currencies such as the euro hard, also lifted the dollar.The greenback is down from September's two-decade highs, but it's still up 8% against a basket of currencies since the conflict began.The impact on other safe havens such as governments bonds is complicated, however. Yes, U.S. and European bond prices rose in the days following Russia's invasion as investors sought safety in top quality assets.But they soon fell and yields soared as the war triggered an energy shock and inflation surged, while central banks responded with aggressive rate hikes. Germany's 10-year Bund yield has risen to 2.4% from just 0.2% on Feb. 23, 2022..2/THE STING IN THE PIPELINEThe war in Ukraine brought with it an energy crisis like no other. Post-COVID-19 reopening had already sent prices for anything from oil to coal to natural gas higher. But when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in late February, European natural gas prices rocketed by almost 400% in two weeks. By August, they were 700% higher than a year earlier.Pre-war, Russia supplied over 30% of Europe's gas, most of it through a network of pipelines, thousands of kilometres long. Once Western sanctions hit, the flows of gas dried up. Energy prices soared, bringing the threat of blackouts, recession and a worrying switch back to dirtier sources of fuel.Thankfully, winter has proven mild and Europe has found other suppliers, bringing the gas price back to around 50 MWh, its lowest since August 2021. But, there's a lag of around 6-9 months between what happens on the wholesale market and what happens to consumers' bills, meaning last August's punishing spike to almost 350 MWh - equivalent to an oil price of over $200 a barrel - hasn't even begun to bite.Story continues3/PRECIOUS FOODFood prices, which were already on a tear in 2021 after COVID-19, leaped again after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on fears of shortages and disruptions to Black Sea trade.Last year the U.N. food agency's average price index hit its highest level on record, up 14.3% from the previous year. The index had already gained 28% in 2021.Higher energy and input costs, adverse weather and continued strong global food demand are adding to pressure from significant market disruptions. Over the whole of 2022, four of the five food sub-indexes - cereals, meat, dairy and vegetable oils - reached record highs.Food price pressures are easing, but that does little to soften the blow for many developing nations, where food and energy prices make up a larger share of spending. Shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine mean the world is unlikely to meet a longstanding goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030, the World Bank has warned.4/ ROUBLE TROUBLEThe past year has seen wild swings for Russia's currency - a more than 50% tumble following the invasion to record lows in March, followed by a more than 200% rise to a multi-year high in June thanks to soaring energy prices, FX restrictions and the central bank ramping up interest rates. Twelve months on, the rouble is broadly back to its pre-war 12-month average.Russia wants a weaker rouble to boost hydrocarbon revenues, which is helping plug a widening budget deficit and soaring domestic spending due to the ballooning cost of the Ukraine war. But it is also attempting to shore up its finances by selling its foreign currency reserves, and started interventions for the first time in almost a year in January. Moscow burned through $38 billion of its rainy-day fund, the National Wealth Fund, in December alone to cover its deficit.Fresh pressure on the currency could come from sanctions: EU members are expected to approve a 10th package around the anniversary.5/TWO CAMPS FOR EU BANKSEuropean banks took a drubbing when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, those that have slashed links have outperformed and those that have not continue to see their shares take a hit.Raiffeisen Bank International's shares suffered their worst daily drop since the onset of the war on Monday, as the Austrian lender drew the attention of U.S. sanctions officials over its Russian business. Shares of Raiffeisen, deeply embedded in Russia's financial system, have slumped over 40% since the start of 2022.France's Societe Generale sold its Russia business Rosbank in May, taking a 3 billion euro ($3.18 billion) hit. Italy's UniCredit cut its cross-border exposure to Russia by two thirds, but still owns one of Russia's top 15 lenders. It has pledged to cut its presence, which has reassured investors. SocGen and UniCredit shares have rebounded from the post-invasion hit.

Krebs; President, CEO &amp; Director; Coeur Mining, Inc.Thomas S. Whelan; Senior VP &amp; CFO; Coeur Mining, Inc.Michael Stephan Dudas; Partner; Vertical Research Partners, LLCPresentationOperatorGood day, and welcome to the Coeur Mining Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mitchell Krebs, President and CEO. Please go ahead.Mitchell J. KrebsGood morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and 2022 earnings call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary language on forward-looking statements in today's slide deck and refer to our SEC filings on our website. I'll start with the main highlights on Slide 3 before turning the call over to Mick, Tom and Aoife. The fourth quarter was Coeur's strongest quarter of the year, which helped to achieve our overall full year production guidance for the third consecutive year, definitely not an easy task last year with such unprecedented volatility. Rochester was the main driver to our solid finish last year. Both silver and gold production increased over 30% quarter-over-quarter with sharply lower costs. Ongoing operational enhancements and higher grades contributed to Rochester's results as we begin the transition to the newly expanded infrastructure, where construction remains on track to be completed midyear. We achieved several critical objectives last year that we believe are important value drivers for the company in the short, medium and long term. In the short term, we continued to derisk and advance the Rochester expansion. The project is nearing 80% complete this month and remains on track in terms of budget and schedule. We also further fortified the balance sheet to support our elevated levels of investment in our existing assets that are intended to increase production, decrease costs, extend mine lives and drive a return to positive free cash flow, which Tom will provide more details on in a few minutes. In the medium term, the team at Kensington got an early jump on their multiyear development and drilling program last year by adding approximately 1.5 years to its mine life. As we laid out during our Investor Day in December, we're optimistic about further extending Kensington's mine life and generating solid returns from higher production and lower costs from this investment. Over the longer term, I want to highlight the great results from yesterday's reserve and resource update on Slide 11, which reflects another year of successfully replacing mine reserves. Year-over-year, our gold reserves increased by roughly 12%, while silver reserves increased approximately 3%. Over the past 5 years, we have invested roughly $245 million in exploration during a time when many companies have underinvested in this critical component of the business. Over that time, our gold equivalent reserves have expanded by 2 million ounces or roughly 34% net of depletion. In addition, our gold equivalent resources have increased nearly 4 million ounces or approximately 80%. Aoife will provide some additional comments on our exploration successes and our year-end reserve and resource results in a few minutes. Just a few quick thoughts as we look ahead to 2023. Overall, the key for us this year is obviously execution, not only at Rochester with the completion of construction and ramp-up post expansion, but across the entire portfolio to achieve our objectives that can transition the company back to positive free cash flow. We anticipate 2023 will be comprised of 2 very different halves. During the first half, capital intensity is expected to remain high while we experience weaker seasonal operating results from our 2 open pit operations. The first half also includes our normal first quarter outflows relating to 2022 tax, interest and compensation-driven payments. During the second half of the year, capital intensity is expected to sharply decline, and production levels are expected to increase as we begin the commissioning and ramp-up process at Rochester. Overall, 2023 production is expected to increase over last year, driven by Rochester's stronger second half and by an expected strong bounce-back year at Wharf after a lower-grade year in 2022. To quickly wrap up, we remain confident in the key pillars of what we think is a unique strategy in our sector and exclusively North American and U.S.-centric footprint, a contrarian multiyear commitment to exploration that continues to generate meaningful results, investments in expansions that are designed to deliver sector-leading growth and have transformative impacts on the business and a metals mix that offers meaningful and growing exposure to silver. An unrelenting focus by our team on executing this strategy is bringing us closer and closer to that point of transformation that everyone has been working so hard for. With that, I'll turn it over to Mick.Story continuesMichael RoutledgeThanks, Mitch. I'll start by echoing Mitch's comments on the great job our teams have done this last year to deliver guidance amid challenging circumstances. With the right people in the right chairs executing the right strategy, we feel confident in our ability to consistently deliver significant long-term value. Our journey to zero harm progressed well in 2022 with the teams delivering the best environmental health and safety performance in the history of the company. What a fantastic achievement to be proud of, but that journey is not over as we continue to control exposures as we drive to get to 0 as quickly and sustainably as possible. Turning to a brief recap of our fourth quarter production summary on Slide 6 and beginning with Palmarejo. Higher gold grades and uptick in mill throughput led to a nice finish to the year. Full year gold and silver production came in on the high end of guidance range and CAS for gold and silver finished closer to the high end of guidance as Palmarejo fought inflationary headwinds all year round. Despite these challenges, the team delivered nearly $46 million of free cash flow in 2022. Looking ahead, guidance for 2023 anticipates a similar year in terms of gold production, while silver production guidance is significantly higher. Despite continued easing in certain of Palmarejo's input costs, our 2023 cost guidance reflects caution as overall costs remain volatile. Moving to Rochester. The 30-plus percent increases we saw in gold and silver production in the fourth quarter were driven by significantly higher grades due to the mine sequencing placed on pad 4 in September and October that began to break through in the latter half of the quarter. This surge in grades made the difference in helping Rochester exceed its gold production guidance for the year and come in at the high end of its silver production gains. Fourth quarter adjusted CAS for silver and gold on a core product basis were down versus the previous quarter due to high attributable metal sales. We have elected to defer providing 2023 cost guidance at Rochester until midyear given the transitional nature of the year ahead. There will be a lot of moving parts as we start placing crushed ore on Stage VI leach pad on February 1. We turned on the Merrill-Crowe plant during Q2 2023, and we began placing rock through the new crushing circuit later in the summer. The number of (inaudible) visible in the POA 11 photo slides demonstrate clearly that construction is at peak levels on the crushing corridor. The work is proceeding. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Steel erection and equipment installation is proceeding on both the cone crushers in the secondary crusher area as well as both the HPGR crushers in the tertiary crusher area. Slide 12 in the presentation highlights the progress on our key milestones for 2023 at POA 11. The Merrill-Crowe process plant remains on track for completion at the end of the first half of 2023, in line with the P85 schedule. Mechanical equipment setting, process plant building cladding, control systems programming and factory testing are all now complete. Electrical cable and piping installation are well underway. I'm also pleased to report that the construction project has now passed 1.5 million hours as of January 31 without a lost time incident. Turning to Kensington. Once again, a great job by the team to reach a new all-time record in mill throughput. New leadership there continues to make a strong mark and bodes well for the future of this key asset. Challenging recoveries through most of 2022 led Kensington to just missing the low end of the production guidance. 2023 guidance reflects similar levels of production and cost. With the previously discussed infusion of capital at Kensington, this year will be a busy period of development to set the mine up for a strong future. Finishing briefly with Wharf. The team overcame some significant snowfalls in the quarter to finish within expectations near the high end of its 2022 guidance range. 2023 guidance reflects a return to more typical gold production rates with CAS ranges, setting the stage for stronger anticipated cash flow in the year ahead. With that, I'll pass the call over to Tom.Thomas S. WhelanThanks, Mick. Turning to Slide 4. I'll begin with a review of our consolidated financial results before touching on our 2023 guidance and the balance sheet. As expected, Coeur's improved fourth quarter financial results were driven by our highest gold production of the year and the $62 million gain on sale from Sterling Crown. Higher prices, along with gains from our gold hedges, led to a 96% increase in our EBITDA quarter-over-quarter. Speaking of hedging, our 2022 program provided $24 million of net gains, $13 million of which was realized in the fourth quarter. Subsequent to year-end, we took advantage of some short-term momentum in gold and silver prices to add additional downside price protection for 2023. Inflation remains a headwind on our sector's financial performance. While we have seen some moderation in diesel prices, Slide 5 demonstrates the continued pressure on our key cost buckets. Accordingly, our 2023 outlook continues to assume a challenging year for operating costs. I am pleased to report that Coeur's capital cost exposure at POA 11 continued to decrease with approximately $605 million of the estimated capital now committed and $495 million incurred. As Mitch and Mick both mentioned, the project remains on track and on budget with approximately 75% of the remaining CapEx expected to be incurred during the first half of the year. Turning to 2023 guidance. Our guidance remains consistent with our December 2022 Investor Day as we approach the free cash flow inflection point post completion of POA 11. Mitch and Mick have already hit on the key messages around production, operating costs, POA 11 capital and the tale of 2 halves this year. I want to highlight a couple of additional very important items within the guidance, which we expect will deliver NAV growth and reduce overall risk for the company. We have allocated value-accretive capital for additional underground mine development and exploration at Kensington and Palmarejo, which is expected to extend mine lives and reduce risk at both mines. To accommodate these extended mine lives, both sites are investing in new tailings capacity during 2023. Obtaining that crucial POA 1 permit amendment at Kensington last year has allowed us to progress on the aggressive multiyear program at the mine, which includes this permitted tailings capacity. At Palmarejo, the new tailings capacity will be inside the old open pit, which is a significant environmental derisking milestone. Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 16 provides a good snapshot of our financial position, featuring total potential liquidity of over $500 million. We do, however, remain concerned in the short term about the overall macro environment for gold and silver prices and continued operating cost inflation. This concern, coupled with our tale of 2 halves of 2023, has led us to take several actions to keep our balance sheet flexible during the final few months of capital intensity at Rochester. The key elements of our financing strategy include: we recently monetized our remaining position in Victoria Gold for $40 million; our revolving credit facility, which has $280 million of capacity; our hedging program designed to provide downside commodity price risk protection during this period of capital intensity. We head into 2023 with approximately 180,000 ounces of gold hedged at $1,961 per ounce and 3.2 million ounces of silver hedged at $24.55 per ounce. And we put a new ATM in place for gross potential proceeds of up to $100 million. These key initiatives taken to enhance our total potential liquidity leave us feeling comfortable that the balance sheet will provide the required flexibility to deliver the industry-leading high-return growth that will transform our company. I'll now turn it over to Aoife.Aoife Mairead McGrathThanks, Tom. As Mitch said earlier, successful exploration in 2022 led to an increase in our global reserves with growth at each site. Looking at a few key highlights. At Kensington, the multiyear exploration plan described in our December Investor Day is already bearing fruit with reserves increasing by an impressive 56%. The majority of this growth came from Upper Kensington Zones 30, 30A and 30B. These zones remain open, and we will continue to expand and infill drill these areas through 2023. In addition to Kensington, we saw a resource and reserve additions at Elmira. And this deposit, along with the Johnson deposit, show opportunities for growth in 2023 and beyond. Detailed geological modeling is increasing our understanding of all deposits in Kensington, and we are hopeful that this will help us vector to both higher grades and new zones. At our high-grade Silvertip exploration project, we also saw notable growth with silver, lead and zinc measured and indicated resources increasing by 73%, 69% and 81%, respectively, year-over-year. 2022 was an exciting year for exploration with the following notable achievements. Firstly, expansion drilling increased mineralization at the Southern Silver Zone to approximately 500 meters vertical extent and 1,800 meters along strike as shown on Slide 10. Mineralization was also intersected in multiple stratigraphic units, thereby increasing the amount of the stratigraphic column that is amenable to mineralization. This opens up significantly more opportunity for stacked mantos and multiple chimneys. Secondly, the discovery of new chimney structures beneath the Discovery manto zone, and thirdly, scout drilling in the Saddle zone generates new chimney targets for follow-up in 2023. We believe Silvertip has good potential to be a long-life mine. And right now, we have visibility on how to build a sufficient reserve base to enable a decision to proceed once the economics are sufficiently compelling. We see the continued growth at Silvertip as opportunity to expand Coeur's future global production, reduce costs and boost free cash flow. I will now pass the call back to Mitch.Mitchell J. KrebsThanks, Aoife. Before moving to the Q&amp;A, I want to highlight Slide 17 that summarizes our clear priorities for 2023. As I mentioned at the outset, execution remains front and center in this pivotal year. By successfully delivering on these objectives, we plan to reach the end of 2023 on the cusp of a new growth phase for the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research Partners.Michael Stephan DudasI know 2023 couldn't consume enough, Mitch. Regarding Rochester, what's the hurdle? Or what's the pinch point you guys are seeing over the next few months that gives the marketplace confidence that your targets on construction, completion and the ramp will occur within what you guys are talking about today?Mitchell J. KrebsYes. Good question. This is the -- it's a busy year with a lot of moving parts out there, all of this coming together here now with the first half focused on the Stage VI leach pad, which is now complete. We're stacking ore on that. Merrill-Crowe comes next in the second quarter, crusher mid-summer, and then we start putting rock through it and ramping it up throughout the second half of the year. Mick, do you want to give a little bit of detail on some of the other moving parts that are going on there throughout the year?Michael RoutledgeYes, yes, exactly. So we completed stacking ore on pad 4 and moved across the pad 6 on schedule. That was a great achievement, milestone on February 1. And then now we'll continue to leach pad 4, so we'll see some metal from that throughout the first half of the year, but we're stocking now and building up inventory on pad 6 right through to that middle of the year when we expect to commission the heap leach on the Merrill-Crowe, and then we'll start seeing that metal come out of inventory in the second half of the year as per the plan. From a project perspective, we're still on the P85 project schedule and went through the normal challenging Nevada winter around continuing to stay on track. We're still on that track. And from a manpower and loading perspective for the project, TIC and Kiewit had done a fantastic job at reloading and covering any attrition on that project, and we are fully manned up to get the rest of the project done throughout the year.Mitchell J. KrebsJust to add on to that, Mike. The conversation around here has started to transition quite noticeably less about construction activities and schedule and more about operational readiness plans around the ramp-up schedule and everything that needs to go into ensuring that this thing ramps up smoothly throughout the back half of the year to deliver on that second half production growth and set us up for what should be that inflection point in cash flow as we head into 2024. So it's -- there's been a noticeable shift in terms of what the -- where the priorities are and where the new focus areas are out there now. So that's exciting to see.Michael Stephan DudasThat's very encouraging, Mitch. My follow-up is you just discussed on Silvertip some pretty positive results. Any changes in thoughts from Investor Day to how you're thinking about the project today, timing or structure, recognizing job 1 is getting Rochester done?Mitchell J. KrebsYes. You said it right there. Job 1 in 2023 is POA 11 execution. The priorities at Silvertip this year really are twofold, minimizing the holding cost as we prioritize POA 11 and continuing to expand the resource up there, which we have a lot of confidence in. We've seen it grow significantly since we acquired it. And even year-over-year, Aoife mentioned the percentage growth in the different metals just year-over-year. We have a lot of confidence that, that will continue. It will be a bit of a smaller program this year compared to last year, targeting a little bit more on the expansion side to step out a bit more with the thought being that as we do that, and we have a lot of confidence that we can, that's just going to help us put together a compelling business case in a few more years that will justify the capital that would go into expanding and starting that up as another operation. But -- so the priority for now is to keep growing the resource, which Aoife, I think, has some confidence in. And a couple of things you want to maybe say about that, Aoife?Aoife Mairead McGrathYes. I mean we had a great year in 2022 up there at Silvertip. We really -- our understanding of the deposits really developed. Southern Silver Zone itself is becoming quite an important part of this story at the moment. So we've extended mineralization there over a vertical extent of 500 meters and the along strike extent to date still open is 1,800 meters. So that in itself is opening up that Southern Silver Zone as a very -- as something that can add significantly to the tons there. And it's a vertical orebody. It's a chimney. So it's potentially an easier mining scenario for us as well. In addition to that, we did some scout holes under the Discovery Zone, which to date has been a manto horizon, more so a sub-horizontal zone. And we found some new chimneys under that, which we'll follow up on this year. And also down to the South, all the way down to Tour Ridge, we are scheduling over the last few years intersection mineralization, and that's another few kilometers of extent that we can expand into.Mitchell J. KrebsSo Mike, just to pull the lens back then, POA 11 this year, back to positive free cash flow, lower cost, reduced debt, keep expanding that resource at Silvertip in the meantime, get to a point where we have an attractive business case at Silvertip, at which point then we can have some options to think about whether we'd go it alone, whether we'd bring in a partner or whether that's a strategic partner or a financial partner, operating JV, nonoperating JV. But we need that compelling business case to get to that point, and drilling is the way to get there. And so that's the kind of the progression and priorities as we sit here today.Operator(Operator Instructions) There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mitchell Krebs for any closing remarks.Mitchell J. KrebsOkay. Well, hey, we appreciate everybody's time today during this busy reporting period, and we look forward to talking with you all after the first quarter in the springtime. Thanks again, and have a good day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

It will also stop making soda ash, as well as cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, two building blocks in the production of artificial fabrics, paints, and varnishes.BASF’s fuel bill rose by €3.2B last year as the company was forced to scramble for alternative sources of gas at unprecedented prices. At Ludwigshafen alone, BASF ended up paying €1.4B more for gas in 2022 than in 2021, even though it cut its consumption by 35%.The group had already warned that the spike in energy prices had badly hurt the global competitiveness of its sites in Germany. These had profited for years from cheap and reliable natural gas from Russia which it used both as a fuel and a feedstock for its organic chemistry operations.The group's net loss was much larger than the group had flagged in January, due in part to its decision to write off the Russian assets of its upstream Wintershall Dea subsidiary costing it €6.5B. Some €4.7B of that hit the fourth-quarter income statement.Earnings before interest and taxes all but dried up in the fourth quarter, falling 90% to €119 million. Revenue fell 2.3%, as a 15% fall in sales volumes was partly offset by a 9.2% increase in average prices. The results were also flattered by a 4.5% tailwind from foreign exchange, reflecting the euro’s weakness against the dollar.Story continuesFor the current year, BASF said it expects sales to fall about 2% to a range around €85.5B, while earnings before interest and taxes are set to fall by more than 20% to some €5.1B.The group was also a shareholder in the consortiums that built the two Nord Stream gas pipelines, which were destroyed last summer after Russia unilaterally halted supplies of gas to Germany in an effort to pressure Europe into accepting its aims in Ukraine.Despite the writedowns, the company kept its dividend proposal at €3.40 a share. That didn’t stop the stock price from falling 6.9% by 04:30 ET (09:30 GMT) to its lowest since early January.Related ArticlesBASF slumps after massive writedowns in Russia trigger €4.8 billion lossHigher provisions, legal charges dampen CIBC's quarterly profitU.S. FDA approves Sanofi's bleeding disorder therapy]"

Yet, in certain metros among the country's 50 largest markets, renters can still find relative affordability, according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Rental Report released today.Oklahoma City, Okla. is the only metro among the 50 largest in the nation where renters can find a median-priced apartment for less than $1,000 a month. The report showed that Oklahoma City offered the lowest monthly rental price in January, at $982.There are 10 markets where median monthly rents are lower than $1,300, according to the report. Half are in the Midwest, four are in the South, and one is in the Northeast. None are in the West.The least expensive markets are:Oklahoma City, Okla. - $982Louisville, Ky. - $1,167Birmingham, Ala. - $1,178Rochester, N.Y. - $1,235Columbus, Ohio - $1,242Indianapolis, Ind. - $1,266Memphis, Tenn. - $1,274St. Louis, Mo. - $1,279Cleveland, Ohio - $1,290Kansas City, Mo./Kan. - $1,298Renters looking to take advantage of the best possible prices should move quickly. While the rents in these metros are the lowest among the 50 largest, for many of them, prices are increasing at a faster rate than in the rest of the country.""With high rents across the country, places that offer relative affordability tend to be in high demand, which means more competition and that these lower prices might not last,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Many of these metros have fewer available rental homes than previous months, and fewer apartments to choose from means prices are likely to go up. Cities including Indianapolis, Birmingham, Columbus, Kansas City, Cleveland, and Rochester are among the more affordable metros that experienced the fastest year-over-year price increases in January 2023, leaving few metros that are maintaining their current level of affordability.""Story continuesMany of these areas also have less rental availability than in past years, suggesting that affordable metros are increasing in popularity. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the average rental vacancy rate across these least expensive markets was 7.6% — a significant drop from the 9.7% vacancy rate in the fourth quarter 2017. However, seven of the most-affordable areas still had greater vacancy rates than the country's average, which was last tracked at 5.8% nationwide.Nationwide, rent growth for studio to two-bedroom properties continued to slow. Median rent was down 2.9% year-over-year, the lowest growth rate in 22 months. In comparison, January 2022 rent was up 16.2% from the year prior.Last month was the twelfth month of cooling rent growth and the sixth month in a row with a single-digit rate increase. The median asking rent in the 50 largest metros declined to $1,726, down by $7 from last month and $80 less than the August 2022 peak of $1,806. Yet, rental prices are still up 20.6% ($295 higher) from pre-pandemic January 2020.Rental Data – 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas – January 2023MetroOverall Median RentOverall Rent YYRental Vacancy RateHomeownership RateAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,835-0.9 %5.4 %59.9 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,666-1.4 %4.9 %64.6 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,7330.4 %6.9 %72.1 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,1788.8 %13.2 %71.0 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,8504.6 %3.1 %60.7 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.NANA3.8 %66.8 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,6443.1 %3.4 %60.3 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$1,9654.8 %5.8 %68.9 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky.-Ind.$1,3125.7 %7.9 %65.2 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,2907.1 %3.1 %61.8 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2428.3 %4.2 %58.6 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,6102.6 %6.7 %56.9 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,8741.2 %4.8 %67.7 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3293.0 %4.4 %71.0 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.NANA4.4 %67.9 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,4532.3 %10.5 %66.7 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,26610.5 %9.8 %71.6 %Jacksonville, Fla.NANA7.4 %63.5 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,2988.2 %8.9 %66.4 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,509-6.2 %6.1 %60.2 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,6324.0 %3.3 %50.2 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,1671.8 %5.9 %70.4 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,274-0.1 %6.7 %61.3 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,5594.8 %6.0 %57.1 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,4158.6 %7.2 %50.5 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,4523.3 %6.8 %75.8 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,6720.7 %5.5 %67.6 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,671-3.8 %8.2 %67.9 %New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Pa.$2,7309.4 %3.1 %50.1 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$9825.2 %12.5 %65.2 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,9323.8 %6.4 %59.3 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,8035.4 %5.3 %69.9 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,593-3.4 %7.0 %67.2 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,3465.3 %5.5 %72.6 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,6856.1 %4.8 %65.9 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.NANA3.8 %64.8 %Raleigh, N.C.$1,5822.6 %6.0 %62.3 %Richmond, Va.$1,4463.1 %5.7 %68.5 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,1142.1 %2.9 %63.9 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,2356.2 %3.7 %74.8 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,829-3.6 %2.5 %61.5 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,3772.2 %7.2 %60.6 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,6662.9 %3.2 %54.1 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$2,8090.7 %5.5 %59.1 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,0052.9 %5.6 %54.8 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,0080.8 %4.7 %66.3 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,2794.7 %8.2 %71.9 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,8732.0 %7.5 %63.1 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4975.2 %8.3 %61.2 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,1033.3 %5.2 %64.4 %MethodologyRental data as of January for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®.

It recorded the best quarterly performance in seven years related to postpaid phone net additions of 217,000, and retail postpaid net additions of 1,434,000. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products also led to the best total broadband quarterly performance in over a decade with total broadband net additions of 416,000.However, high operating expenses weighed on the margins and the adjusted earnings failed to meet the consensus estimate.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the quarter was $6,698 million or $1.56 per share compared with $4,737 million or $1.11 per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase despite higher operating expenses was primarily attributable to a net pre-tax benefit of approximately $2.5 billion related to a mark-to-market adjustment for pension and OPEB (other post-employment benefits) liabilities. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings per share were $1.19 compared with the restated tally of $1.33 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For 2022, Verizon recorded a net income of $21,748 million or $5.06 per share compared with $22,618 million or $5.32 per share for 2021. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for 2022 were $5.18 per share compared with the restated tally of $5.50 for 2021.Story continuesRevenuesQuarterly total operating revenues increased to $35,251 million from $34,067 million in the prior year as strong wireless service revenues and higher wireless equipment revenues were partially offset by wireline decline and divestures. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $35,059 million. For 2022, total operating revenues increased 2.4% year over year to $136,835 million.Quarterly Segment ResultsConsumer: Total revenues from this segment increased 4.2% year over year to $26,770 million, driven by solid demand for higher-tier premium mobility and broadband offerings and incremental contribution from TracFone. Strong wireless service revenue momentum and higher equipment revenues were witnessed in the quarter.Service revenues were up 5% to $18,443 million, while wireless equipment revenues jumped 3.3% to $6,528 million, led by higher work-from-home-driven customer activities. Other revenues totaled $1,799 million, down 0.8% year over year.Verizon recorded 41,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net additions in the quarter due to strong fixed wireless momentum, tablet and wearables adoption. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.06%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 0.86%. The company recorded 56,000 Fios Internet net additions as high demand for reliable fiber optic broadband was spurred by increasing work-from-home trend. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 262,000 for the quarter. However, Verizon registered 80,000 Fios Video net losses in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.The segment’s operating income declined 4.4% to $7,028 million with a margin of 26.3%, down from 28.6% in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA decreased 2% to $10,139 million with a margin of 37.9% compared with 40.3% in the prior-year quarter due to higher promotional expense related to device subsidies.Business: The segment revenues were up 1.2% to $7,900 million due to pricing actions and growth in customer base. Verizon had 455,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 176,000 postpaid phone net additions. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.38%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 1.06%. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 117,000 for the quarter. Operating income declined to $585 million from $796 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 7.4% and 10.2%. EBITDA was down 8.2% to $1,683 million owing to higher subsidies for a margin of 21.3% compared with 23.5% in the year-earlier quarter.Other Quarterly DetailsTotal operating expenses increased 5.9% year over year to $28,026 million, while operating income was down 5% to $7,225 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined marginally to $11,747 million from $11,765 million for respective margins of 33.3% and 34.5% owing to the divesture of Verizon Media.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityFor 2022, Verizon generated $37,141 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $39,539 million in the year-ago period. The reduction was primarily induced by working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes affected receivable levels, and higher inventory levels as part of supply chain management. Free cash flow for 2022 was $14,054 million compared with $19,253 million in the prior-year period.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $2,605 million in cash and cash equivalents with $140,676 million of long-term debt compared with the respective tallies of $2,921 million and 143,425 million. Capital expenditure for 2022 totaled $23,087 million, up from $20,286 million in prior-year period, driven by expenses of $6.2 billion related to C-Band deployment. The continued build out of OneFiber and C-Band spectrum expansion will expand the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network across the country.GuidanceVerizon has offered an initial guidance for 2023 and expects wireless service revenue growth in the range of 2.5%-4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $47-$48.5 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share. Capital expenditure is estimated between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Verizon has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Verizon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Through corporate, foundation and brand-led partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, Fashion Institute of Technology's Social Justice Center, The Opportunity Network, Harlem's Fashion Row, and more, Tapestry and its house of brands is equipping historically underrepresented and marginalized students around the world with the resources needed to achieve their dreams. Since 2021, the Tapestry Foundation has awarded over $1M to support Black and brown communities while in FY2022, the Coach Foundation has awarded 4,200 scholarships and invested $12.5 million in financial grants and product donations.We believe that by embracing our responsibility in the marketplace as a global fashion company, we can affect positive change for our industry and deliver on our values. We aim to set the standard for consumer inclusion and advocacy through our brands.In 2017, Tapestry joined the Open to All campaign, a national effort to ensure everyone feels safe, respected and accepted as they live, shop, and work, regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, immigration status, religion or disability. In 2022, as part of this same coalition, Tapestry signed onto the Mitigate Racial Bias in Retail Charter, which aims to bring retailers together to implement tactics and actions that can mitigate racial biases from the shopper experience and create more welcoming retail environments for all. Store employees across all Tapestry brands have started to receive training and accountability measures to ensure an inclusive shopping experience for our BIPOC customers.Story continuesBy attracting, retaining and growing top talent from a diverse set of backgrounds, we are becoming an employer of choice in a rapidly evolving talent market. We strive to empower our people to help shape the place they work, to be part of building a culture of belonging.

Throughout February, the Black Alliance is featuring industry professionals who will share their career journeys and highlight the important work being done to create more opportunities for our BIPOC community.In FY2022 the Tapestry Foundation launched the ERG Community Grant Program, which supports all of Tapestry's ERGs with charitable grant funding for partnerships with organizations connected to the specific missions of each ERG and aligned to our greater enterprise mission to serve as accountable stewards for the communities in which we live and work. In FY2022, the Tapestry Foundation donated $141,000 to 19 organizations around the world as nominated by our ERGs. This Black History Month, the Black Alliance will be making a grant to benefit Brotherhood Sister Sol (BroSis), a nonprofit dedicated to educating, organizing and training Black and Latinx youth to challenge inequity and champion opportunity.Tapestry knows that the kind of ingenuity that turns heads, that turns objects into icons, comes only from places few have looked before - so diverse perspectives are some of the greatest assets we have.We give space for the voices of customers, too, to express themselves through our brands rather than the other way around.

The stock market wobbled. Mortgage rates crept toward an eye-popping 7%.Here are several calls in the market you probably missed during this busy week.The Bond King Rings the AlarmDoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach was in good spirits and top investing form when Yahoo Finance (video above) met him at his snazzy new industrial-themed office in Tampa, Florida, this week for am exclusive sit-down.Gundlach struck a note of caution on the economic outlook (he sees a hard landing) but also rang the alarm bell to call attention to one market risk not many are thinking about yet.""I don't know if it's a risk for this year ... but I think China taking over Taiwan is a very significant risk,"" he said. ""They [China] love the fact I'm sure that we are destroying a lot of our munitions in defense of Ukraine, which obviously depletes our ability to arm Taiwan. So they'd love us to blow up all our stuff in Ukraine. That balloon coming over, there's a lot of odd things going on that one should think that the risk of a greater escalation of hostilities is the odds on case.""Here's what else Gundlach told us.Nvidia Hype Forces the Hand of Goldman SachsA Yahoo Finance user favorite ticker — Nvidia (NVDA) — saw shares explode some 14% on Thursday. The move wasn't because the computing giant had an amazing fourth quarter — in fact, sales plunged 21% amid the broader tech demand pullback, as Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith broke down in a new ""After the Call"" segment.But what the company did do is sell the sizzle on the buzzword of the moment in tech land: AI (a.k.a. artificial intelligence), as Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports.An upbeat, AI-filled earnings call caused Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari to upgrade his rating on Nvidia's stock to buy from hold. Hari's new 12-month price target on Nvidia: $275, which assumes about 17% upside from current levels.Story continuesSaid Hari in his upgrade note: ""In hindsight, we acknowledge that our decision to remain on the sidelines in anticipation of a pullback in the company’s fundamentals was wrong. Looking ahead, while we recognize that the stock has meaningfully outperformed the group year to date, we are upgrading the stock from neutral to buy with an updated 12-month price target of $275, as we believe the combination of positive estimate revisions and a potential expansion in the stock’s multiple — consistent with historical recovery phases — will drive continued outperformance in the stock.""For more Nvidia analysis from the Yahoo Finance team, head here.Here Comes a Big Day for Tesla ... and Maybe Deutsche BankYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian will be paying close attention to Tesla's investor day on March 1, where the Elon Musk-led EV maker is expected to release various software updates (among other new initiatives). Knowing the unpredictable Musk, he could very well provide an update on quarter-to-date demand.One never knows with Elon.But what Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner thinks he knows is a big move higher in Tesla's stock due to info stemming from the investor day.""We believe [the investor day] has the potential to help the stock keep rerating higher,"" Rosner said in a client note.He added: ""We expect the company to introduce Master Plan 3 and present the main drivers of its longer-term growth strategy, and in particular its 3rd generation vehicle platform which could support multiple future vehicles and segments at a lower price point. We also anticipate updates on its FSD [full self-driving] software V11, hardware HW4, Cybertruck/Semi production, project Highland refresh of Model 3, and ramp-up of the energy storage business. To support its volume and cost targets, we think Tesla will speak about the role of in-house battery manufacturing technology, capacity expansion, and actions to secure raw materials.""Rosner lifted his price target on Tesla's stock to $250 from $220, which predicts roughly 24% upside from current levels. Of course, Rosner is all in with a buy rating on the stock.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.The fourth-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $2.93 billion.Management noted that the top line was aided by non-recurring favorable adjustments in the third quarter. However, the quarterly revenues were negatively impacted by increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues, favorable changes in government rates driven by the administration of influenza vaccines, favorable changes in the commercial mix and the continued migration to Medicare Advantage plans.Full-year revenues were $11.61 billion, reflecting a 0.1% dip from the comparable 2021 period.

QuoteMargin DetailsIn the quarter under review, DaVita’s gross profit fell 6.3% to $828.2 million. Gross margin contracted 163 basis points (bps) to 28.4%.We had projected a 25.5% of gross margin for the fourth quarter.General &amp; administrative expenses climbed 17.7% to $379.7 million.Adjusted operating profit totaled $448.5 million, reflecting a 20.1% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter contracted 368 bps to 15.4%.Financial PositionDaVita exited the full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $321.8 million compared with $484.2 million at the end of 2021.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $6.46.Our TakeDaVita ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with lower-than-expected revenues. The dismal overall top-line and bottom-line results are disappointing. A fall in the company’s dialysis patient service revenues and total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter is concerning. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well for the company. The company faced negative volume trends and continued labor pressure during the reported quarter, which is further concerning.However, DaVita’s better-than-expected earnings are encouraging. The uptick in the company’s Other revenues during the period is impressive. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and the opening of others within the United States and overseas is also encouraging.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

Strong performance by the Cardiovascular segment and the majority of its product categories also contributed to the top line.Constant exchange rate (CER), organic revenues rose 8.2% year over year, primarily on the back of a more favorable-than-anticipated international sales trend, particularly in the EMEA region, and demand in the United States, which was in line with the growth expectations Merit Medical had outlined on its third-quarter call.Full-year revenues were $1.15 billion, reflecting a 7.1% improvement from the comparable 2021 period.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.20 billion.Net revenues from the cardiovascular segment are expected to be in the range of $1.156 billion-$1.172 billion, representing an increase of approximately 3-5% over the comparable reported figures of 2022.The endoscopy segment’s net revenues are projected to be between $37.5 million and $37.8 million, representing an increase of approximately 14-16% over the comparable reported figures of 2022.Adjusted EPS for 2023 are projected to be within $2.80-$2.89. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.82.Our TakeMerit Medical exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines is impressive. The company saw revenue growth in its Cardiovascular segment and across the majority of its product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside are impressive. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends pushed up the overall top line, which is encouraging.The company stands to benefit from the execution of its global growth and profitability plan. A robust product line raises investors’ optimism about the stock. This month, Merit Medical announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Device Designation for the SCOUT MD Surgical Guidance System. In November 2022, the company announced the U.S. commercial release of the basixALPHA Inflation Device and the U.S. commercial release of the PreludeSYNC EZ Radial Compression Device. These also look promising for the stock.However, a decline in the CPS and Endoscopy revenues during the reported quarter is concerning. Rising product costs putting pressure on Merit Medical’s margin, thereby leading to a contraction of both margins, does not look encouraging.

The company had also launched the iAccess device for go anatomy procedures in the same time period. The addition of these new devices will provide unique and improved treatment solutions for surgeons, customers and patients. The company’s iAccess device received positive market feedback.In August 2022, Glaukos announced that it had received the FDA 510(K) clearance for iStent infinite — the first FDA-cleared micro-invasive implantable device used as a standalone treatment option for glaucoma patients to reduce elevated intraocular pressure. The potential launch of the product, expected later this year, will likely accelerate Glaucoma net sales growth going forward. The company also has several other treatment options in its pipeline. These developments raise our optimism about the stock.However, wider adjusted loss per share and lower overall revenues on a year-over-year basis are disappointing.

Within the segment, Instruments sales grew by 2.2% at the Constant Exchange Rate.The organic revenue growth of 1.7% in Neurosurgery was driven by strong growth in CUSA capital and disposables in the United States and global small capital sales, offset by the recall impact of CereLink monitors.Story continuesThe Tissue Technologies segment (34% of the revenues), reported revenues of $133.4 million in the fourth quarter, down 1.1% year over year on a reported basis and up 5% on an organic basis. The organic growth was mainly due to sales in Wound Reconstruction and Care, with strength from Integra Skin, amniotics, Primatrix, MicroMatrix and Cytal, partially offset by a decline in the private label.MarginsThe gross profit in the reported quarter totaled $250.1 million, up 0.3% year over year. The gross margin expanded 136 basis points (bps) to 62.8%.SG&amp;A expenses declined 6.4% to $151.9 million in the quarter under review, while research and development expenses rose 8.3% to $26.8 million.The adjusted operating profit was $71.4 million, up 14.6% year over year. The adjusted operating margin expanded 257 bps to 17.9%.Financial PositionIntegra exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $456.7 million, down from the reported figure of $513.4 million at the end of 2021.The cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of 2022 was $264.4 million compared with $312.4 million in the year-ago period.On Jan 26, 2023, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase plan with Goldman Sachs to buy back $150 million of its outstanding common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share. The transactions are expected to be completed in the first half of 2023.GuidanceThe company provided its financial guidance for 2023. The guidance takes into account the recovery of markets prior to pandemic levels and the impact of Integra’s commercial capability build-out and new products.For the full year, IART projects revenues in the band of $1.60-$1.62 billion. This suggests reported growth of approximately 2.9%-4% and organic growth of 4%-5.2%.The sequential improvement from first to second-half growth is primarily driven by the gradual recovery of supply throughout the year, the normalization of private label orders from 2022, the recovery of China’s business post-pandemic lockdowns, and the timing of the CereLink relaunch.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.61 billion.The company expects to deliver adjusted earnings per diluted share in the band of $3.43-$3.51, considering the impact of the share repurchase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.51.Integra’s guidance for the first quarter of 2023 takes into account the timing of the CereLink relaunch and the recent acquisition of Surgical Innovation Associates and the divestiture of the TWC business.For the first quarter, Integra expects revenues in the range of $370-$376 million, which suggests growth of approximately -1.5% to flat and organic growth of 2-3.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $379.6 million.The adjusted EPS is estimated in the range of 72-76 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 78 cents.Our TakeIntegra exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with an earnings beat and a year-over-year decline in revenues. The decrease was mainly due to a significant FX headwind and the impact of the TWC divestiture.On a positive note, consistent demand recovery in markets across various segments and key product lines at near pre-pandemic levels fuelled by the gradual improvement of the supply chain, buoys optimism. The relaunch of Cerelink at the end of the second quarter of 2023 is also a positive.Within the Tissue Technologies segment, the increased capacity and productivity from the integration of the ACell portfolio delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Expansion in both margins is also impressive.With plans for international expansion in the pipeline, an improvement in the gross margin through a favorable product mix and a focus on price capture and increased efficiencies within the company’s manufacturing sites, Integra expects accelerated growth in 2023 and strengthened margin accretion.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIntegra currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The figure was higher than our estimate of $8.6 billion.Net investment income decreased 15.8% year over year to $625 million, primarily due to a decline in income in the non-fixed income investment portfolio, which can be attributed to lower private equity partnership returns. The figure was lower than our estimate of $672.7 million.Catastrophe losses totaled $459 million pre-tax, wider than $36 million pre-tax in the prior-year quarter.

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Fox’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Fox What's The Opportunity In Fox?Great news for investors – Fox is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $57.68, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Fox’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Fox?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Fox. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since FOXA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FOXA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy FOXA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about Fox as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share, marking an 8.3% increase from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid out on Mar 31 to shareholders of record on Mar 6.Prior to this, M&amp;T Bank hiked its dividend by 9.1% to $1.20 per share in November 2021. We believe such disbursements highlight the company’s operational strength and commitment to enhancing shareholder wealth.Considering the last day’s closing price of $154.20, M&amp;T Bank’s dividend yield currently stands at 3.09%. It raised its quarterly dividend four times in the last five years. Also, it has a five-year annualized dividend growth of 7.63%.

The Vito project demonstrates Shell's continued investment in deep-water development and the Gulf of Mexico’s potential as a major energy source.The Vito project has incorporated several technological advancements, including a new generation of subsea pumps that can operate in extreme temperatures and pressures. There are also advanced automation systems on the floating production unit that allow remote monitoring and control of the production facilities.According to Shell, the Vito project is expected to have a productive life of at least 25 years, a significant investment in the future of energy. Shell has also implemented measures to reduce the project's carbon footprint, such as using a subsea injection system that will re-inject gas into the reservoir to enhance oil recovery and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The Vito project is also expected to create hundreds of jobs during the construction phase and thousands of jobs during the operational phase. It will also generate significant revenue for the local economy, and the oil and gas industry as a whole.The Vito deep-water development is a notable milestone for the industry. It showcases the potential of deep-water exploration and the importance of investing in technological advancements to reduce environmental impact and maximize efficiency. Shell's Vito deep-water project is an excellent example of the company's commitment to meeting the world's energy demands while striving towards net-zero emissions by 2050.The project showcases Shell's deep-water expertise, and its success will generate greater value from the Gulf of Mexico while maintaining low greenhouse gas intensity.Story continuesShell and its co-owner of the Vito development have reduced CO2 emissions by 80% over its lifetime, and its cost by more than 70%. Shell's Whale project is another offshore oil and gas development located in the Gulf of Mexico. This project will replicate Vito's design and involve exploring and producing oil and natural gas from several reservoirs deep beneath the ocean floor.Shell's Powering Progress strategy will focus on investing in lower-carbon energy solutions and high-return Upstream investments.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Comcast’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Comcast Is Comcast Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Comcast is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $61.49, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Comcast’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Comcast?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Comcast. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CMCSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CMCSA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CMCSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

They’re well-established in nature, have more analyst coverage, and are highly liquid, all of which are significant advantages contributing to their popularity among investors.And, of course, many large-caps reward their shareholders with dividends, providing another beneficial advantage.For those interested in reaping an income from their investments, three large-cap stocks – Energy Transfer ET, Altria Group MO, and Prudential Financial PRU – could all be considerations.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAll three stocks currently yield over 5% annually and have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, undoubtedly a strong pairing. Let’s take a closer look at each one.Prudential Financial  A leader in financial services, Prudential Financial, offers various products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, and more. Presently, PRU is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPRU’s annual dividend yield currently sits at 5.1%, more than double its Zacks Finance sector average. In addition, the company’s 51% payout ratio resides on the sustainable side.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s bottom line looks to expand nicely, with estimates for its current fiscal year indicating a 28% jump in earnings. And in FY24, estimates allude to a further 5% of growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEnergy TransferEnergy Transfer owns and operates diversified portfolios of energy assets primarily in the United States. Currently, ET sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s nearly impossible to ignore Energy Transfer’s dividend metrics; the company’s annual dividend currently stands tall at 9.4%, nowhere near the Zacks Oils and Energy sector average.Story continuesWhile the yield is undoubtedly impressive, it’s important to remember that it’s vulnerable to a change in business conditions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAltria GroupAltria Group is a world-leading producer and marketer of cigarettes, tobacco, and similar products. Like the stocks above, MO sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), seeing its earnings outlook drift higher across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAltria rewards its shareholders handsomely; its annual dividend currently yields 8%, well above the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Impressively, the company has grown its payout by more than 5% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, MO’s valuation multiples don’t appear expensive, with its 9.3X forward earnings multiple sitting below its 10.5X five-year median and Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvestors should be aware that high yields can be unsustainable from a long-term perspective and typically get cut when business isn’t as fruitful, perhaps steering away income investors that prefer reliability.When looking for dividend reliability, Dividend Aristocrats are a great option. A few Dividend Aristocrats that sport a favorable Zacks Rank include Archer Daniels Midland ADM and Coca-Cola KO.Still, all three stocks above – Energy Transfer ET, Altria Group MO, and Prudential Financial PRU –  currently carry annual dividend yields greater than 5%, making them valid considerations for investors looking to stack cash quickly.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 1.6%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderOccidental’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to have been driven by strong production from its domestic assets. Lower-than-expected production from the Permian Basin in fourth-quarter is anticipated to be more than offset by strong production in the Gulf of Mexico and Rockies region.Occidental’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from the ongoing share repurchases. The repayment of outstanding debts would also reduce capital servicing costs and boost margins.Fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from a strong contribution from OxyChem. Fundamentals in the caustic soda market also remain supportive.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter crude oil production is pegged at 656 thousand barrels of oil per day. For natural gas, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1,754 thousand cubic feet per day. Occidental expects total production of 1,200-1,260 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) and 556-590 MBOE/d output from Permian Resources.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at $1.83 per share and $8.65 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 23.7% and 8%, respectively.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Occidental this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is the case here, as you will see below.

For more oil stocks, head on over to 5 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The oil and gas industry is one of the most important and lucrative sectors in the world. This is simply due to the nature of the product itself, with the marvels of internal combustion ensuring that whether it's transportation or power generation, some of the most crucial sectors of the global economy remain dependent on fossil fuels.Naturally, this criticality within the global economy also lends the industry some high valuations. For instance, a research report from Maximize Market Research outlines that the global crude oil market was worth $1.3 trillion in 2021 and from then until 2029 it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% to be worth an estimated $1.6 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that growth in the global population along with developments in the petrochemical and agricultural sectors will drive the industry forward. It adds that both Asia and North America will outpace the broader industry in terms of growth since the pair will each exhibit a 1.9% CAGR.Right now, the crude oil industry is battling to figure out what impact a Chinese economic recovery will have on the industry. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that while oil prices will increase to $100 per barrel, this will only happen in December this year due to higher supplies from the U.S. and Russia, longer winters, and a Chinese reopening. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), on the other hand, believes that oil demand this year can grow by a whopping 36%, based almost entirely on Chinese strength.Today, we'll take a look at which oil companies are popular with hedge funds, with the top picks being Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Story continues15 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashOur Methodology We used Insider Monkey's collection of 943 hedge fund portfolios to determine which oil companies they had invested in as of the fourth quarter of last year.Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15.

310,91d9e340-13aa-3ce1-a2cf-cadda76b00b7,URI,2023-02-24,United Rentals (URI) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-uri-great-momentum-170005857.html,1677171605,STORY,['URI'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at United Rentals (URI), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. United Rentals currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for URI that show why this equipment rental company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor URI, shares are up 2.81% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry is up 1.37% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.64% compares favorably with the industry's 2.09% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of United Rentals have risen 25.22%, and are up 47.75% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 0.09% and -5.7%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to URI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. URI is currently averaging 761,431 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with URI.Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost URI's consensus estimate, increasing from $37.14 to $41.69 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that URI is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep United Rentals on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earnings not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also increased on a year-over-year basis.However, net sales declined from the previous year and missed the consensus mark. Shares of the company inched up 0.4% on Feb 22, post-earnings release.Looking forward, Mr. Bosway said, “We are well prepared for what will continue to be a fluid external environment and we expect that the Residential market will return to normal demand seasonality, panel supply for the solar industry will improve in the second half of the year, and Agtech projects for produce growing will get finalized. The long-term fundamentals of our end markets remain strong, and given the progress we made in the last 12 months in our market positioning, systems, processes, and organization, we expect to drive solid performance in 2023 as we continue to execute toward our 2025 objectives.”Inside the HeadlinesGibraltar reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 by 1.4% and increased 28.6% year over year from 56 cents.

On an adjusted basis, the top line declined 5.2% year over year to $312.9 million and organically by 9.8%. The decline was due to lower Residential, Renewables and Agtech businesses’ revenues.

The backlog was down 17% year over year. Despite strong customer demand for products and services, negative impacts of the U.S. solar industry, especially on scoping and scheduling of projects, ailed the segment’s results.Adjusted operating margin of 15.2% expanded a whopping 1,390 basis points (bps) year over year and 230 bps sequentially, driven by field operations productivity, 80/20 project management, business mix and material productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 1,440 bps from the prior-year quarter’s levels to 17.9%.Residential Products: Net sales in the segment increased 7.8% year over year to $171.9 million. Acquisition of QAP contributed 9.4% to the segment’s sales growth. Organic revenue remained challenged as the market returned to its typical lower seasonal demand patterns.Adjusted operating margins of 13.4% contracted 320 bps in the quarter. The alignment of price and material cost and the timing of changes in commodity indexes as well as QAP buyout impacted margin.

Adjusted EBITDA margin was down 350 bps year over year to 7.6%.Infrastructure: Sales in the segment rose 4.8% year over year to $17.3 million.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Ryan Burke: Thank you, Chelsea. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 22, 2022 (sic) , and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release.You can find our press release, subsequent reports, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to two questions. Of course, after that, feel free to jump back in queue with additional questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.Joe Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to begin by providing color on two recent announcements. We'll then move on to our performance in 2022 and outlook for 2023. First, on February 5th, we announced a 50% increase to our quarterly common dividend, a raise from $8 to $12 per share on an annualized basis. It is a result of a great effort by the team that has produced record performance over the last few years and a validation of our ongoing confidence in the strength of our platform. Second, as announced separately, we made a proposal to acquire Life Storage at a substantial premium after several attempts to engage in negotiations privately. I'd like to highlight a few important reasons why we think this combination is poised to unlock superior growth and value creation for shareholders.Story continuesFirst, there is significant opportunity to accelerate growth and profitability as Life Storage's portfolio benefits from Public Storage's industry-leading brand. Our platform achieves approximately 80% same-store operating margins compared to Life Storage's margins at approximately 73%. And we see an opportunity to narrow that gap with their real estate assets as part of our industry-leading platform. Second, we believe there is significant upside to grow revenues and earnings in our respective ancillary business lines, including storage insurance, third-party property management, business customer offerings and lending. Third, we see expanded portfolio growth opportunities as we leverage Public Storage's fully integrated in-house development team, the only one of its kind in the industry, to capitalize on additional development and redevelopment opportunities to enhance Life Storage's existing portfolio.And finally, all of this will be supported by an industry-leading balance sheet with low pro forma leverage, an advantaged cost of capital and significant capacity to fund future growth in conjunction with retained cash flow. Since announcing the proposal, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both companies' shareholders who clearly recognize the significant benefits uniquely achievable through a combination with Public Storage. As you likely saw, on February 16th, Life Storage issued its own press release rejecting our proposal. Nothing in that response changed our thinking. We have a high level of conviction in the strategic and financial merits, and we are committed to pursuing a potential combination. We are encouraged, in that February 16th release, Life Storage indicated openness to opportunities to enhance shareholder value.We look forward to engaging in good faith discussions regarding a mutually agreeable combination. While we appreciate that analysts and shareholders have ongoing questions with respect to our proposal, the purposes of today's call is to discuss our fourth quarter earnings and our outlook for 2023. As such, we will not be addressing questions related to the proposal at this time. Now, turning to our performance and outlook. 2022 was a year of milestones for Public Storage, including celebrating our 50th anniversary. The team and platform achieved record results in our same-store and non-same-store portfolios, elevating the customer experience through technology and operating model transformation, enhancing our properties through the Property of Tomorrow program and growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment and third-party management.We did all of this while maintaining the industry's best balance sheet, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow. To name just a few of our collective accomplishments, we achieved an 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through the combination of revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. We grew beyond 200 million owned square feet and $4 billion in total revenues. We built our property development pipeline to approximately $1 billion. We received the prestigious Great Place to Work award based on feedback provided directly by our employees. And we achieved top-scoring U.S. self-storage REITs across the leading sustainability benchmarks. We are firing on all cylinders while strengthening the already formidable competitive advantages we have across our business.And those competitive advantages are heightened in the type of macro environment we are in today on top of two consecutive years of record 20%-plus core FFO growth. Simply put, we have the people, technologies, platforms and brand which lead us to a position of strength in 2023. Demand for self-storage remains strong, as you see with our move-in volume up more than 11% during the quarter. The aspects of the business that have historically made it resilient are on display. This is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from a newer driver in the form of people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay.Our customer lengths of stay are at record levels, a positive trend, given rent increases to existing customers are a key driver to our revenue growth. The outlook for new competitive supply is also in our favor. We are seeing less new property development nationally due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the macro landscape. With continuing strong demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are very well positioned in 2023. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.Roll up door, Door, StorageTom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. I'll start with a review of capital allocation for the year. We invested $1 billion between acquisitions and developments in 2022, including the $190 million Neighborhood Florida portfolio in the fourth quarter. That portfolio added to our over 400 properties that we're operating with our remote property management platforms. Overall, the 2022 acquisition environment was impacted by a shift of cost of capital with transaction volumes down and driven by smaller deals compared to 2021. We expect that trend to continue this year with our forecast for $750 million of transaction volume for Public Storage consistent with last year. We are well positioned as an acquirer today, given our industry-leading balance sheet and cost of capital.And adding to acquisitions, our development pipeline stands at approximately $1 billion as we seek to expand the portfolio with our in-house team. The development environment is challenging today across the industry, as Joe highlighted. Against that backdrop, Public Storage is planning on delivering $375 million of new generation 5 properties in 2023 and more in 2024, as we lean on our development competitive advantages. And we look forward to putting these new properties on our national platform to drive outperformance. Now, on the financial performance. We finished the year strong, reporting core FFO of $4.16 for the quarter and $15.92 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range and representing 22.4% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks.Let's look at the contributors for the quarter. In the same-store, our revenue increased 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 21. That performance represents a moderation from last quarter's 14.7% growth and a return to seasonality and tough comps comparing to 2021. Now on expenses, same-store direct costs of operations were up 5.3%. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties was up 15.8% in the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout, growing 51% compared to last year. Now, I'll shift to the outlook. We introduced 2023 core FFO guidance with a $16.45 midpoint, representing 5.5% growth from 2022, again excluding the contribution of PS Business Parks.As we enter the year, there's no question there's a wide range of potential macroeconomic pathways that will influence customer demand and behavior. The consumer has held up well to this point in the year, but the Fed is certainly signaling they're not finished. If we look at the same-store revenue outlook, I'd characterize the low end of the range of the outlook as a recessionary pathway and the higher end as a softer landing for the economy. We anticipate occupancy will be lower throughout the year and follow a typical seasonal pattern. Rate will be the driver of revenue growth with the moderation through the year based on lower move-in rents and tougher existing tenant rate increase comps. That moderation results in a trending towards longer-term averages of growth.Our expectations are for 5.75% same-store expense growth, driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of 3.2%. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are again poised to be a strong contributor, growing from $448 million of NOI contribution in 2022 to $520 million at the midpoint. And looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the incremental non-same-store NOI to stabilization from those properties acquired or completed at December 31st is an additional $80 million of NOI. This pool of lease-up assets will continue to be a powerful growth engine over the next several years. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock solid. We have a well-laddered long-term debt profile with limited floating rate exposure and over $4 billion of preferred stock with perpetual fixed distributions.Our leverage of 3.4 times net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $800 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position, heading into 2023. So with that, I'd like to open the call up for questions.See also Ark Invest Stock Portfolio: 15 Biggest Positions and Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks.

""The CHIPS and Science Act presents us with an opportunity to make investments that are similarly consequential for our nation’s future.”Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks about semiconductors at the White House in September. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)Raimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.The speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works— and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.""Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,"" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America’s national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.Story continuesIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law ""the most significant competition policy in our generation."" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.The overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the “premier destination in the world” for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that “every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.”'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'The Biden administration’s challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.The situation is even worse with the world’s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.Raimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. ""That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,"" she said.President Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Raimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.“Our success will be short-lived"" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&amp;D is what will make it a longer term success.""It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,"" she said.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added ""as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.""The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.Return on investment? National security. Raimondo compared the effort to President Lincoln’s creation of the land-grant university system, nuclear security in the 1940s, and John F. Kennedy’s famous call to put a man on the moon.She noted that the 1960s saw an explosion of PhDs in the science and engineering fields to back up Kennedy’s 1961 call—and she is hoping for something similar in the years ahead in universities and high schools to create a bigger semiconductor industry workforce.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The next step in the administration’s plan will come next Tuesday when Raimondo’s department unveils the formal application that manufacturing companies will need to access the money. “It's going to be a very comprehensive application, which will be crystal clear about the specific criteria that we'll be looking for and the information we need from companies,” Raimondo told reporters.The speech also nodded to concerns that the billions, once they are signed over, could end going to things like stock buybacks. During her speech, Raimondo promised to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and said she would will demand transparency from companies. A recent letter from prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on the administration to be vigilant on the buyback issue, saying it could undermine the national security goals of the program.""I expect to be held accountable,"" Raimondo said.Meanwhile, the race for the money remains well underway with places like Arizona making a play to be one of the manufacturing hubs.Raimondo said she hopes the $50 billion in government funds will lead to somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 billion in private investment.""Get in the boat, row with us to achieve this mission,"" she said during the speech in a comment directed towards private investors around the country.

The company’s profit warning was its fourth since last July. In my book, that makes it one of three celebrity stocks to sell.Celebrity partnerships are worthwhile ventures until they fall apart, either through the celebrity’s reckless actions as in West’s situation or by overestimating a star’s drawing power. Either way, history is littered with celebrity endorsements going wrong. Just as plenty of retailers may go bankrupt, there are always retailers and consumer brands that have been financially hurt by their CEOs’ desire to make a splash with customers and shareholders, using celebrities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSometimes that strategy works, and sometimes it doesn’t. It didn’t work out for Adidas. That’s why the sneaker retailer is on my list of three celebrity stocks to sell. PTONPeloton$13.60YUMYum! Brands$132.04ADDYYAdidas$77.05Peloton Interactive (PTON)Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefrontSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) announced in July 2022 that Ashton Kutcher — the actor famous for his starring role in That ‘70s Show television series which ran eight years from 1998 to 2006 — would host its 10-week “Our Future Selves” series. As part of the show, Kutcher was supposed to train for a marathon.The marathon was Kutcher’s first. He was running to support Thorn, a non-profit that he co-founded in order to fight the exploitation of children.  Kim Kardashian and other celebrities made guest appearances on the series. I don’t think there’s anything bad about a celebrity trying to publicize a cause that’s near and dear to him or her. However, there’s no question that naïve investors could view the appearances by Kutcher and Kardashian  as endorsements of Peloton’s products and, by extension, the company, itself. As a result, a number of those investors may have bought Peloton stock. Story continuesSince the July 2022 announcement through Feb. 17, PTON stock was up 52%. If you are one of those naïve investors who bought on the Kutcher news and are still holding, you’d be wise to sell your shares before your luck runs out. The company is in the middle of being turned around by Barry McCarthy, a former executive at both Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Under the new CEO,  PTON  managed to barely generate positive free cash flow last quarter. But Until the company figures out how to separate its subscription business from its hardware business, it will continue to be overvalued at 1.51x times its sales.  Yum! Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThe celebrity in question when it comes to Yum! (NYSE:YUM) is Pete Davidson, the former Saturday Night Live comedian and performer and one-time boyfriend of Kim Kardashian. Davidson endorsed Taco Bell’s breakfast business through his 2022 ads promoting the morning part of the restaurant chain’s overall day. According to Fortune, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) Q4 2022 results were better than analyst expectations, thanks largely to Taco Bell. But Davidson’s long list of girlfriends and girlfriend troubles could ultimately blow up for any company using the wildly energetic comedian as its spokesperson. And while there’s no question, Yum! Brands and Taco Bell will be tempted to dip into the well of success a second time to continue driving 9% transaction growth for Taco Bell’s breakfast business; the risk is that the talented comedian will go off the rails and somehow tarnish the brand’s reputation. It can happen. I’m not saying it will, but it’s something to be aware of. If you look at the company’s overall financial performance in 2022, it’s nothing special. On the top line, its revenues climbed 4% year-over-year to $6.84 billion, while on the bottom line, its operating profit was 2% higher year-over-year at $2.19 billion. Its business model extracts a little from a lot of customers. It can’t afford a misstep or its growth will decelerate. Its enterprise value is 20.8x times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, higher than its five-year average of 18.7 times. So its stock isn’t cheap at its current prices. Adidas (ADDYY)Source: ShutterstockAs I mentioned in the intro, the Kanye West experiment has been a financial boondoggle for the German company. It’s left reeling at a time when Nike (NYSE:NKE) continues to perform at an exceptional level despite the inflationary pressures faced by all global companies. In its fiscal Q2, Nike easily beat analysts’ average expectations for its revenue and earnings, with its Nike Direct business growing by 16% YOY to $5.4 billion. Its online and retail stores account for 41% of its overall business.Meanwhile, at Adidas, its new CEO Bjørn Gulden, who came over after doing a masterful job at Puma (OTCMKTS:PUMSY), has been very transparent about the company’s underperformance.“‘The numbers speak for themselves. We are currently not performing the way we should,’ said Bjørn Gulden, the chief executive of Adidas, who joined the company last month. ‘2023 will be a year of transition to set the base to again be a growing and profitable company,’” The Guardian reported on Feb. 10. ADDYY has lost nearly 40% of its value over the past year. The one bright spot: Since announcing it was terminating its partnership with Ye (Kanye West), its shares have rebounded, gaining 54% in the four months since it released the news. Adidas’ relationship with Kanye dates back to November 2013, when it announced an endorsement deal with the musician. By 2019, Adidas’ Yeezy brand generated more than $1 billion of annual revenue, with 2021 sales of $2 billion. However, the CEO at the time, Kasper Rorsted, knew West was starting to fall apart at the seams. It was only a matter of time before he would crash the partnership and possibly the Adidas brand. Ironically, West was initially hired to make the brand “cool again.” Unfortunately, it has got a long way to go to reach that milestone. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Full-year 2022 revenue saw a decrease of 9.8% to $418.9 million. However, CEO Ethan Brown said the brand is ""making solid progress"" in its ""transition to a sustainable growth model, one that emphasizes the achievement of cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023.""Here's what Beyond Meat reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, per Bloomberg consensus estimates:Revenue: $79.9 million versus $75.7 million expectedAdjusted earnings per share: -$1.05 versus -$1.18 expectedBeyond Meat is focused on its three primary pillars, Brown said, including driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction, bringing inventory levels down while generating cash flow, and placing a ""greater emphasis on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while also supporting strategic key long-term partners and opportunities.”At the end of October, Beyond Meat announced plans to reduce expenses and target cash flow operations within the second half of 2023, which coincided with the announcement of a 19% cut in its workforce.In the release, Brown said the fourth-quarter results ""clearly demonstrate delivery"" of the plan it set out last fall, ""including solid sequential progress on margin recovery and operating expense reduction, and continued inventory drawdown.""Standouts of the fourth quarter, per the release, include industry notoriety received from innovations like Beyond Steak, in addition to the launch of plant-based McPlant Nuggets in Germany earlier this week. That offering is part of it three-year partnership with McDonald's (MCD), which is now days away from its two-year anniversary. Back in September of 2021, McDonald's announced its plan to test its first-ever plant-based burger, the McPlant.Story continuesIn the release, there was no mention of the status of its partnership with KFC (YUM), Beyond Chicken.As far as retailers, right now, Beyond Meat is offered at Kroger (KR), Walmart (WMT), Publix Super Markets, Costco (COST), Whole Foods (AMZN) and Target (TGT).SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 14: In this photo illustration, a McDonald's McPlant Beyond Meat burger is displayed with french fries at a McDonald's restaurant on February 14, 2022 in San Rafael, California. Nearly three years after Burger King and Carl's Jr. rolled out meat-free burgers, McDonald's has debuted its McPlant burger made with a Beyond Meat vegetarian patty. For a limited time the burger is being offered at 600 McDonald's restaurants across the country. (Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)For the full year 2023 outlook, the company expects net revenue to be between a range of $375 million to $415 million, a decrease of 10% to 1% compared to 2022. Gross margin is expected to be in the low-double digit range. It expects to incur $250 million in operating expenses, ""weighted slightly more towards the first half of the year.""The company did note ""unforeseen impacts"" that could impact the company's results including ""near-term uncertainty related to macroeconomic issues,"" such as inflation and rising interest rates, ""demand in the plant-based meat category, increasing concerns about the likelihood of a recession, increased competition, supply chain disruptions, challenges related to labor availability and, to a lesser extent, COVID-19 and its potential impact on consumer behavior and demand levels, among other things.""This comes as demand for plant-based meat overall is lower, as customers trade-down for cheaper protein options amid inflation.Brown said he remains focused becoming cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023 and on the long-term outlook for the brand as it ""navigate(s) current conditions.""He said, ""We remain intently focused on positioning Beyond Meat to capture the vast opportunity to be a major protein provider in the $1.4 trillion meat industry.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The upside resulted from higher average revenues per display (referred to as yield) compared with the prior-year quarter.The company’s transit and other revenues of $117.2 million climbed 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.

325,442f764b-b1d4-3e95-88bc-fde6fea63d95,STX,2023-02-24,7 Battered Stocks From 2022 Primed for a 2023 Revival,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-battered-stocks-2022-primed-184545938.html,1676918745,STORY,"['DIS', 'AMD', 'MTCH', 'STX', 'META', 'PYPL', 'SE']","[While last year presented challenges for sectors not tied to the hydrocarbon energy space, the technology-related segment suffered horrendously. Though it does lead to opportunities in battered stocks to buy this year. And, if you believe in the buy-low, sell-high philosophy, you may want to read ahead. Fundamentally, the battered stocks to buy on this list present rational reasons for believing in their resurgence. Perhaps they’re undervalued relative to earnings or sales. Or they may enjoy either Wall street analyst support and/or sizable price targets. And some ideas just might be too heavily discounted to ignore.For other potential ideas, you can check out MarketWatch’s list of the biggest losers of 2022. Since there are only so many hours in a day, below are seven battered stocks to buy for 2023.SESea Ltd.$65.01PYPLPayPal$74.66MTCHMatch Group$43.63STXSeagate Technology$70.26AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$78.50DISWalt Disney$105.22METAMeta Platforms$172.88InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSea Limited (SE)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockStarting off this list of battered stocks to buy, Singapore-based tech conglomerate Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) isn’t on MarketWatch’s list above. But it could dubiously “deserve” to be. For instance, in the trailing year, SE remains down 49% below parity. And that’s inclusive of the nearly 23% lift it enjoyed since the Jan. opener this year. Frankly, such a framework doesn’t inspire confidence.At the same time, I look to the fundamentals, as in the bigger-picture fundamentals. According to a Reuters article published in October last year, experts project Southeast Asia’s internet economy to be worth $330 billion by 2025. This tally actually represents a downgrade from a previous forecast due to economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, the main target is that by 2030, this subsector should reach a valuation of $1 trillion. Now, it could be possible that this forecast might be delayed one or two years. Fine – that’s not a reason to murder SE stock. If you’re patient, I believe this is one of the battered stocks to buy.Story continuesPayPal (PYPL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative undergirding PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) comes down to the burgeoning gig economy. Experts project that by 2028, the global gig economy could reach a valuation of $873 billion. From 2022 to the end of the forecasted period, this expansion translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.18%. The gig economy is happening and PayPal offers an excellent platform for gig workers (i.e. independent contractors).Of course, PayPal plies its trade in the broader financial technology (fintech) segment. And fintech features incredible competition – part of the reason why PYPL performed so poorly. Per MarketWatch, shares plunged 62.2% in 2022. Even in the trailing year, shares remain 28% below parity. However, PayPal commands a long operational history dating back to the dawn of the (modern) internet. Not too many of its competitors can say that.Also, PYPL enjoys support from Wall Street analysts, who peg it as a consensus moderate buy. And get this – their average price target stands at $112.89, implying over 51% upside potential. Thus, it’s easily one of the battered stocks to buy.Match Group (MTCH)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7From a financial perspective, I can see why Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) was one of the biggest losers in 2022. Per MarketWatch, MTCH ended up shedding 68.6% of its market value. Throughout 2022, the inflation rate skyrocketed against historical norms. Therefore, it imposed an affordability crisis on the social scene, if you catch my drift. Later, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes discombobulated the overall framework, posing serious business problems.To be completely transparent, the economic circumstances don’t particularly bode well for retail consumer-related enterprises. For instance, mass layoffs – especially for high-paying positions – don’t offer much encouragement. Nevertheless, Match offers a convenient online mechanism for people to socially connect (I’m going to stick with neutral phrasing here).Plus, Match presents a greater incentivization profile than your typical consumer discretionary service. Social connection represents a pertinent human need. In that way, then, Match partially benefits from inelastic demand. Finally, Wall Street analysts dig MTCH, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $60.23, implying 38% upside potential.Seagate Technology (STX)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA data storage company, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) invariably suffered steep losses last year. First, the environment of rising borrowing costs didn’t favor the growth-centric tech ecosystem. Second, the negative impact on data centers led to slower demand for storage equipment. Therefore, it wasn’t particularly surprising that STX ranked among the biggest losers that MarketWatch identified.According to the publication, STX gave up 53.4% of equity value in 2022. It’s still down significantly on a trailing-year basis. However, since the January opener, STX gained over 35%. Moving forward, contrarians might target it as one of the battered stocks to buy.Financially, Seagate’s Shiller price-earnings ratio pings at 14.49 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 22.16 times. Thus, as a discount to earnings, Seagate ranks better than 69% of its peers. Further, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 12.6%, outpacing the 74.39% of its rivals. And its net margin of 6.61% beat out nearly 64% of the industry. To top it off, hedge fund sentiment for Seagate ranks as very positive. Therefore, it’s one of the battered stocks to buy for those who enjoy taking smart risks.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comDue to the sharp headwinds of 2022, semiconductor specialist Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took quite a beating. For one thing, the chip-manufacturing space broadly suffered damage as consumer sentiment sank. Further, the cryptocurrency market imploded last year. As you probably know, AMD’s graphics processing units (GPUs) undergird blockchain-mining rigs.According to MarketWatch, AMD suffered a hefty blow of 55% in 2022. It’s still hurting, with the security down 31% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, since the January opener, AMD managed to pop up nearly 23%. Now, the question is, can the semiconductor firm keep the momentum going?To be blunt, I don’t think the crypto market will cooperate with AMD despite the complex’s recent resurgence. Fundamentally, the Fed’s top priority centers on controlling inflation. So, we may not be done with the interest rate hikes yet.However, as consumers adjust to new realities, AMD’s influence in home entertainment could lift the mood. Notably, Wall Street analysts want to give AMD a chance, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $92.86, implying over 18% upside potential. Thus, it could make an interesting case for battered stocks to buy.Disney (DIS)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comIf you want some three-dimensional chess in your battered stocks to buy, check out entertainment giant Disney (NYSE:DIS). While not a pure-play tech firm, Disney’s foray into streaming services makes it tech adjacent at the least. Unfortunately, consumer pressures associated with the malaise of 2022 hurt DIS stock badly. Per MarketWatch, shares tumbled nearly 44% last year.According to Sarah Smith, InvestorPlace’s Editor-in-Chief, earlier this month, Disney announced that it would cut 7,000 jobs or roughly 3% of its workforce. About a month before, Disney also put an end to hybrid work arrangements. Of course, remote workers cried foul, signing a petition about how this would impact morale among other challenges. Realistically, though, signing petitions to a company announcing mass layoffs represents an utterly foolish thing to do. My guess is that if people are silly enough to do that, they’re reckless enough to go through with their threats.And you know what that would mean? Disney gets off the hook regarding paying unemployment insurance because disgruntled workers quit voluntarily. Again, it’s a very stupid move but it’s great for the shareholder. So, DIS is one of the battered stocks to buy.Meta Platforms (META)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comEasily one of the biggest losers last year was Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Once one of the undisputed kings of tech, Meta suffered a reality check due to declining digital advertising sales. Further, it eventually had to do the unthinkable, joining other tech firms in mass layoffs. However, the pain that it’s absorbing could be a good thing in the long run, making META among the battered stocks to buy.Financially, Gurufocus.com identifies META as a significantly undervalued investment based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value. Also, according to the investment resource’s discounted cash flow analysis, META’s fair value may be $295.24. At the time of writing, shares traded hands at $172.88. From that angle, META may have a 71% upside potential. Fundamentally, despite economic obstacles, enterprises must advertise to stay ahead of the game. Therefore, I expect the digital ad market to bounce back, boding well for META.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg META as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $215.20, implying over 24% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the enticing examples of battered stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:UPS) insiders sold US$13m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-nyse-ups-120033841.html,1677240033,STORY,['UPS'],"[The fact that multiple United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceThe Executive VP and President of International, Kathleen Gutmann, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$10m worth of shares at a price of US$190 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$180. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in United Parcel Service didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At United Parcel Service Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of United Parcel Service shares. In total, Executive VP and President of International Kathleen Gutmann dumped US$10m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of United Parcel ServiceMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.05% of United Parcel Service shares, worth about US$71m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About United Parcel Service Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We're in no rush to buy! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing United Parcel Service. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for United Parcel Service (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.Of course United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

340,8b0e314d-e3c2-35ae-b8bb-b443e1522e9d,NI,2023-02-24,5 Utility Stocks to Buy as Volatility Grips Wall Street,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-utility-stocks-buy-volatility-130201091.html,1677157321,STORY,"['MGEE', 'MDU', 'XEL', 'NIMC', 'AEE']","[Volatility has reappeared on Wall Street following market participants' concerns about a higher interest regime for a longer period and the possibility of a recession in 2023. The welcome rally of U.S. stocks that we have seen since the beginning of January to mid-February is fading out gradually.Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation. At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthen your portfolio.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNiSource Inc.

This compares to loss of $0.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -266.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of equipment and services to energy companies would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.03, delivering a surprise of -66.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.FMC Technologies , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $1.69 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.50%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.52 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.FMC Technologies shares have added about 8.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4%.What's Next for FMC Technologies?While FMC Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FMC Technologies: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

For more food companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Stocks. The food industry is one of the most crucial sectors in the world, and one that is also often thought of as a harbor against recession. The reasoning for this argues that during an economic downturn, while consumers will reduce their luxury spending, and put off buying an iPhone for example, they still have to buy food. Additionally, the food industry is also one of the largest in the world since it does not have to worry about creating demand and instead has to think of innovative ways to manage demand and out compete rivals in business processes such as logistics and supply chain management.Taking a look at the monetary estimates of the industry, a research report from Fortune Business Insights spells out the sheer scale of the sector. Zoning in on the food processing market, it points out that the sector was worth a whopping $2.3 trillion in 2021, and adds that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% to be worth an estimated $5.1 trillion by 2029.The sector's strength is evidenced by this CAGR, as trillion dollar industries generally do not have growth rates that end up exceeding 5%. The research firm outlines that the market growth will be supported by several trends, such as the growth in vegetarian diets, the surge in migration to cities, an increase in online ordering, and higher disposable incomes to spend on dining out.Today, we will take a look at some of the most profitable food companies in the world, and some of them are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Nestlé S.A. (OTCMKTS:NSRGY).Most Profitable Food StocksOur Methodology In order to pick out the top players in terms of profitability in the food industry, we started by picking out the top fifty companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.

We are looking forward to a fruitful discussion on Coterra performance, outlook for 2023, 3-year outlook and our tuneup on our return of capital approach. We had an excellent fourth quarter and full year in 2022, driven by superior asset performance, good execution and some commodity price vintage. We finished the fourth quarter above the high end of our guidance on both oil and natural gas. This was made possible by the efforts we undertook during the year on weatherization. We experienced little downtime during the December winter storm events in the Permian, Anadarko and the Marcellus. This took careful planning, smart engineering, great field coordination and perseverance and a lot of grid on the part of our operational staff in all 3 regions. The lack of significant downtime was also helped by collaboration between our Permian, Anadarko and Marcellus business units. We brought our teams together earlier in the fall to share experiences and best practices on weatherization and it paid off. Kudos to our teams who kept us online and flowing during these challenging weather events. We also generated excellent financial results during the quarter and full year. For the full year 2022, we generated almost $4 billion in free cash flow. We returned almost $2 billion in cash to our shareholders through the dividends bought back $1.25 billion of Coterra's stock and retired $874 million in long-term debt. We achieved almost all of our annual operational goals, including a continuation of our multiyear effort towards emission reductions. Coterra maintains one of the lowest emission intensities in our space. This is also true if one separates our Permian asset and looks at them in isolation. It's due to our continuing efforts towards tankless facility implementation, electrification, moving to centralized emergency flaring and establishing a more aggressive inspection cadence than federal and state rules demand. Our entire organization is focused on these efforts. Our top tier results are a reflection of our commitment and focus. We announced last night that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share buyback, which based on our current outlook, could be executed over the next 18 to 24 months. We are pivoting our capital return priorities to favor buybacks over the variable dividend. This is now growth of intensive study and debate about the macro environment we find ourselves in, investor feedback and our viewpoint on a looming global supply demand imbalance. We're not backing off our core pledge to return at least 50% of free cash flow to our owners in the form of our base dividend, buybacks and variable dividend. The world has changed and we find it prudent to adjust our cash return tactics accordingly. Furthermore, we think that one of the best, most accretive opportunities in the acquisition market lies in Coterra at our current market valuation. As a wise general once said to his troops, if you find that the map doesn't match the terrain, go with the terrain. In 2023, we're going with a terrain. We also announced the 3-year outlook with our release. Although this plan is not set in stone, it reflects our current multiyear activity schedule. It's based on real ready-to-go locations, updated and calibrated type curves and projects our current cost structure. As Slide 6 in our investor deck shows, we have an active plan that generates an annual average 0% to 5% BOE and natural gas growth and an annual average of 5% oil growth by investing $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion per year in each of the next 3 years on average. 2023 is year-1 of this multiyear plan. Basically, the 2023 plan that we announced last night sets up the 3-year cadence nicely. Although production is anticipated to be relatively flat in 2023, we established a cadence that will have significant impact on 2024 and beyond. Furthermore, we have optionality. The 2023 capital plan of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion off ramps in the event conditions were significantly degrade. We have balanced our program with some services under our annual contract, while others are on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This provides flexibility as we navigate through the year. Our program is designed to be a guided missile, not a rifle shot. Coterra enjoys one of the industry's lowest cost of supply with our Marcellus gas assets and at the current commodity strip, our projected returns on our 2023 Marcellus program are outstanding. We have the projects and market takeaway at the ready. However, if conditions worsen, and we choose to retrench, we can pare back. Our capital program is highly flexible depending upon commodity pricing and costs. This means that we can either significantly curtail total activity in capital or shift it from basin to basin as conditions warrant. We could pare back as much as 10% of our total capital this year without impacting 2023. However, it would lower our growth trajectory in the out years. That said, we do not manage our program based upon daily spot prices. Our outlook for 2023 is both guarded and optimistic. We're guarded owing to a muddled outlook on inflation and the inevitable impact that weather has on our natural gas business. We're optimistic because at the current and projected oil and natural gas prices, our project returns are excellent. Although they're not as robust as they were in 2022 owing to commodity downdraft and the fact that we drilled some spectacular opportunities in 2022, our projected 2023 returns are excellent by historical standards. We've built a multiyear plan that invest through the cycles, generates modest profitable growth and checks the box for ability to withstand further commodity price erosion. The ability to confidently invest in the cycles is one of the many benefits of having a fortress balance sheet and assets with a low cost of supply. The flexibility of our multiyear program allows us to control those elements within our control and adjust those elements outside of our control. You'll also find a little more granularity on our asset inventory on Slide 7 in our investor deck. As always, these are real locations with defined calibrated targets and type curves. These locations will be drilled. I hope that you will draw the conclusion from this that we do, although one needs to continually high-grade inventory, Coterra is well positioned for more than 15 years ahead. I would also like to draw your attention to our Anadarko inventory, which is significant and high quality. We are modestly increasing our activity in the Anadarko Basin in 2023 in order to bring forward to outstanding projects. There are more like them waiting in the wings. Anadarko has a significant role to play in Coterra's future. Finally, with this release, we have closed the books on our reserve revision issue. This was a necessary step to level set our evaluation across our portfolio. We finished in the middle of the fairway that we had defined in our Q3 release. As we had promised, there are no new surprises in our end-of-year numbers. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.Scott C. SchroederThanks, Tom. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, shareholder return strategy and then finish with our '23 outlook. During the fourth quarter, Coterra reported net income of $1 billion, discretionary cash flow of $1.4 billion, accrued capital expenditures of $483 million and free cash flow of $892 million. Fourth quarter total production volumes averaged 632 MBoe per day with natural gas volumes averaging 2.78 Bcf per day and oil at 90.7 MBO per day. Oil finished 2% above the high end of guidance and natural gas hit the high end. The strong fourth quarter volume performance was driven by a combination of positive well productivity trends and improved cycle times. Fourth quarter turn-in-lines totaled 46 net wells in line with expectations. During the quarter, we returned 107% of free cash flow, which included $0.57 per share in cash dividends and $0.65 per share in the form of share repurchase. Share repurchases totaled $510 million in the quarter, marking the completion of our $1.25 billion program first announced in the first quarter of 2022. For the full year 2022, total production came in at the high end of guidance relative to our February '22 guidance. Oil came in 2% above the high end and natural gas came in 2% above the midpoint. Net wells online during the year were 3% below our original guidance. Accrued capital expenditures which were 16% above original guidance, totaled $1.74 billion, and were driven by significant service cost inflation. During 2022, the company returned 85% of its free cash flow, 50% in the form of base and variable dividends and 35% in the form of share repurchases. In total, the company returned $3.2 billion to shareholders or 18% of its recent market capitalization. After paying off $874 million of long-term notes during the year, Coterra finished the year with $673 million of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.2x. The company has 4 manageable tranches of debt left with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2029. Turning to return of capital. As many of you read in our release and we have alluded to already, we have multiple updates on the capital return front. First, we increased our annual base dividend 33% to $0.80 per share. This reinforces the confidence management has in our business and our ability to perform across the cycles. It also reinforces our commitment to providing consistent and meaningful annual dividend increases to our owners. Next, after completing our $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization in '22, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Using current commodity prices, this authorization will not be fully executed in a single year, but the $2 billion sustainability is our commitment to the repurchase program and returning value to our shareholders. Lastly, we updated our return on capital priorities. We are reiterating our commitment to returning 50-plus percent of free cash flow to shareholders. However, we are prioritizing share repurchases ahead of variable dividends. Due to market conditions and the value proposition we see in our business, we believe buybacks are the best vehicle to return value to shareholders. Expect Coterra to pay its base dividend, pursue strategic buybacks and supplement with variable dividends if needed, to hit our minimum threshold. Lastly, I will discuss the 2023 outlook. The company's 2023 capital is estimated to be $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. This estimate includes approximately 10% cost inflation over the calendar year 2022 capital expenditures. Total full year '23 production on an equivalent unit of production basis is expected to be relatively flat to slightly down. Oil is expected to grow 2%, and natural gas volumes are expected to modestly decline 1% year-over-year. Drilling activity in 2023 is expected to be relatively consistent with 5 to 6 rigs in the Permian, 2 to 3 rigs in the Marcellus and 2 projects in the Anadarko. Frac activity will be up 31% year-over-year due to project and DUC timing. The company average lateral length is expected to increase approximately 10% year-over-year primarily due to longer laterals in our Upper Marcellus program. Since last summer, 2023 natural gas prices have fallen from a $6 annual average to a recent strip of $3. However, front month prices are near $2.16, and it is yet to be seen if the forward curve will hold. At the same time, service costs have not softened or adjusted. This dynamic has led Coterra to pursue a production maintenance plan in 2023 with anticipation of modest growth in our 3-year plan. The company has an industry-leading balance sheet and low breakevens to maintain consistent activity through the cycle. To put this in context, the company's corporate breakeven, which we define as free cash flow after paying the base dividend sits at $45 WTI and $2.25 Henry Hub. The capital split in 2023 is expected to be 49% in the Permian, 44% in the Marcellus with the remainder going to the Anadarko. On the heels of positive results in the Upper Marcellus in 2022, we are allocating 40% to 50% of our 2023 Marcellus program dollars to further delineate the upper interval. This is above the 30% to 40% range we discussed as the preliminary target in late '22. This range is likely to be the higher end of the range for the Upper Marcellus versus the lower Marella foot over the 3-year period we laid out. Infrastructure timing, pipeline availability and economics were all factors in increasing our allocation to the upper in 2023. Cost guidance for 2023 assumes that dollar per BOE unit costs are flat to down across the board, largely driven by lower commodity prices outlook. Lastly, the future of Coterra is bright. Based on the current service cost environment, we estimate that if the company invests $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion per year over the next 3 years, it will generate a compound annual growth rate of 0% to 5% for both BOE and natural gas and closer to 5% for oil. At current strip, this would generate cumulative free cash flow of approximately $7 billion or 35% of the current market cap. In summary, our first full year at Coterra was stellar. We met our planned production expenses and far exceeded revenues due to a small hedge book and robust prices. For '23 the price dynamic is different, but the engine of success is the same, focused on operational execution of our high-quality inventory to generate strong returns and outside shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Nitin Kumar of Mizuho.Nitin KumarTom, I'd like to maybe unpack a little bit of your commentary around the 2023 capital budget. You said about 10% of that is really targeted towards growth with some off-ramps. So should we expect -- if you were to be in a maintenance mode, is your capital about $1.9 billion or $1.8 billion? And how does that trend over time, particularly over the 3-year period?Thomas E. JordenI'm going to let Blake can handle that.Blake A. SirgoYes. Thanks, Nitin. Yes, our '23 budget number represents the 3-year growth plan we've laid out, not a maintenance plan. If you look at Slide 6, you'll see we plan to spend $2 billion to $2.1 billion per year over the next 3 years. And what that does for us is provide 0% to 5% BOE and gas growth on average annually and oil growth at 5% on average annually. That's something we're choosing to do because we have a deep inventory of high-return projects. But if we chose not to grow and go into maintenance mode, that would drop to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion per year over that same 3-year period at our current cost structure.Nitin KumarGreat. That's helpful. And then maybe this is for Scott, but we noticed the 90% of NYMEX realizations in the Marcellus, which is pretty strong compared to your historical realizations. Could you maybe walk us through how that's coming about in 2023? And how sustainable that is going beyond?Scott C. SchroederActually, Nitin, I'll give that to Blake. He's over our marketing group now.Blake A. SirgoYes. Thanks, Nitin. There's a couple of things going on there. First, we've seen just a reduction in the total basis with the rundown in NYMEX. We've seen that across all our indexes, but it's also our portfolio. We have more contracts in '23 pointed at premium markets than we did in '22. We also have a good chunk of our portfolio that has floors under them and at these lower prices, those floors come into play. So it's really just overall great work by our marketing team. It's a really good tailwind for our -- in the U.S. going into '23.OperatorYour next question is from Umang Choudhary of Goldman Sachs.Umang ChoudharyWanted to start off with your free cash flow allocation priorities. Would love your thoughts around allocation between share repurchase, your target of building a $1 billion on cash on the balance sheet and any thoughts around M&amp;A?Scott C. SchroederSure. What we found in this past year is as we looked at -- we set out about $1.5 billion in variable dividends and watching how the market reacted to that is what gave us pause and we started researching. As we've talked internally and in Tom's prepared remarks, actually, tying into your M&amp;A comment right now, and we said this a year ago, right out of the blocks, one of the best investments is investing in ourselves because we think our assets are head and shoulders above everybody. And so leaning in on the buyback as that return of capital priority, but also increasing the base is what we have telegraphed over the years, too, that we're going to continue to do annual base dividend increases. So from an overall perspective, it was an easy adjustment still reaffirming. In terms of the $1 billion cash, that's a target for us to have. We had a couple of quarters when we were right at $1 billion. What took us below is the decision of getting to our debt level target of right around $2 billion. So we will balance building the cash balance back up to $1 billion with the buybacks, meeting the 50%. Remember the stat I gave, we returned 83% of our free cash flow, so we far exceeded the 50% commitment last year.Umang ChoudharyThat's very helpful. And then maybe to follow up on Nitin's questions on flexibility of a capital program to changing macro conditions. What kind of flex do you have in your program over the next 3 years? And then any color you can provide on the recent cost trends would be helpful?Thomas E. JordenWell, I'll handle the first part, and Blake can talk about cost trends. We have tremendous flexibility. Our teams worked really hard at the latter half of last year building in flexibility. As you can recall, premium equipment was not available unless you were willing to sign a long-term contract. We had a lot of services that came off contract in order to keep them, we had to renew it. And we -- our operations team worked really hard to give us flexibility. So we have some services under annual contract and some that we have the option quarter-to-quarter. Now the longest term we have is an annual contract. So if you look out at the 3-year program, we have tremendous flexibility. But the nice thing about sitting on top of Coterra's assets in our 3 business units, is we can pivot rather nimbly depending on conditions. Right now, we like where we sit, but we are going to look at it continuously during the course of the year.Blake A. SirgoYes. And on the cost trends, the 10% we're showing for '23 is really a reflection of those contracts we entered into in late '22. It sure feels like the market is starting to soften. There's less talk about price increases, more talk about cost holding flat. And if activity starts to drop across the lower 48, we'll be looking to claw some of those costs back.OperatorYour next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.Arun JayaramTom and team, I wanted to get maybe some more thoughts on the 3-year kind of outlook that you provided. I know in 2023, the CapEx budget includes about $180 million for, call it, growth CapEx. And this year, you guys have provided an outlook for call it, 168 net wells at the midpoint. Would that 3-year outlook call for a similar, call it, wells tied to sales or do you have increases baked in to deliver call it, that high single-digit oil growth in '24 and '25 based on this outlook?Thomas E. JordenYes, Arun, I don't have the actual well count in front of me, but it's a fairly flat level of activity is what we're projecting. So I think you could really see a level set in terms of the '23 activity going forward. But just an editorial comment, Arun. If there's one thing that many of us have learned is that in this shale era, the stop start around commodity prices is really damaging to your cost control, the operational cadence and quite frankly, I think, as an industry, we've typically kind of gotten that exactly wrong in terms of when we invest and where we can track. So the nice thing about Coterra is because our assets have such robustness of low commodity prices, we can maintain more of a regular operational cadence. And that's what we're going to do and that's a strategic pivot for us. That's why we put Coterra together. Now whether that operational cadence has our current rig count or a rig count less or a rig higher, we're going to try to maintain a steady cadence and not wake up every day with our hair on fire when we read the paper. We can afford to prosecute this business the way this business needs to be prosecuted.Arun JayaramGreat. Tom, and my follow-up, your Delaware Basin team had a good year in terms of well productivity which you highlight in your deck. I wanted to get some thoughts. I mean, well productivity has been a concern from the buy side, including from one of your partners called in Culberson County, who highlighted that on their call. But what are your thoughts on sustaining this level of well productivity in the Delaware on a go-forward basis? And how does the [Harkey] shale kind of fit into that overall development scheme?Thomas E. JordenWe do not see a change in our Delaware productivity. We -- one of the big differences, as I said in my opening remarks, is in 2022, we just drilled a couple of absolutely lights out outstanding projects. And I'm talking about projects with over 10 wells that average thousands of barrels a day. So those are -- we will have tons of those, and we drilled a couple of them in '22, and that was part of the productivity in '22. But specifically to your question about well-to-well interference, when it comes to the Wolfcamp and [Harkey], we generally see that as one petroleum system. And there will be some degree of pressure communication between the Wolfcamp and Harkey depending on where you are in the basin. But we do not see that as a factor that degrades overall well productivity. We typically stage that development within reasonable proximity of time. But our thinking on that matter is that having the 2 landing zones does not interrupt or impede your overall recovery out of that drilling spacing unit. So we don't see that as a significant issue for the Wolfcamp Harkey , and I think the big answer to your big question is over that 3-year landscape, we don't see a significant change in our Delaware productivity.OperatorYour next question is from Jeanine Wai of Barclays.Jeanine WaiOur first question, maybe a macro question kind of following up on Umang's question about capital allocation. So we realized it could be a moving target, but could you provide your view of mid-cycle natural gas prices? We know that Coterra certainly isn't reactive to the price that we see on the screen and you have good returns even at low prices that are stress tested. But now at what point do you really start to rethink capital allocation?Thomas E. JordenWell, our -- look, mid-cycle is kind of in the beholder. Everybody says the word mid-cycle and we'd rather -- you didn't ask us what the number was, but you do, and we'll answer it. Our current mid-cycle that is our walking around number is 2.75 Bcf per day natural gas and our assets are really, really robust 2.75 Bcf per day natural gas. But we do -- as we said, Jeanine, we had the ability to move it around. The nice thing about having both a deep oil and natural gas inventory is although we produce a lot of natural gas in the Delaware Basin, it's kind of a byproduct. So it's not really a function of the gas price. But right now, our returns are pretty good across our portfolio.Jeanine WaiOkay. Great. And then maybe just following up to Arun's question on the 3-year plan. Oil is expected to grow that 5% gas anywhere between 0% and 5%. There is certainly some nuance to the plan in the Marcellus this year with the Upper Marcellus getting a bigger mix of the CapEx there. But what really determines in the 3-year plan, where gas kind of lands in that range of 0% to 5%? I think you addressed 2023 really well. We're thinking, for example, it seems like Marcellus productivity per foot is getting worse this year, but '24, '25 could be better. The range is it primarily commodity driven. We're just trying to understand kind of the messaging on gas and the solid growth on oil seems to be pretty clear?Thomas E. JordenWell, we are kind of in a shoulder period natural gas right now, to answer your outlook on natural gas. In 2024, we'll have LNG export come online and so we are kind of in a wait-and-see mode on natural gas. We're long term, very bullish because of the world's need for natural gas and particularly the world's need for U.S. LNG exports. We're optimistic that, that's becoming more and more apparent to more and more policymakers, and we remain ready to accelerate our natural gas assets. We're in the mid-40s on Upper Marcellus this year on total footage, and we've talked openly that the Upper Marcellus doesn't have the productivity per foot of the Lower Marcellus. That's just something that's a fact of our assets, still outstanding, still very good, and we're going to continue to develop it as we go.OperatorYour next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateFirst of all, guys, I'd like to acknowledge your disclosure, the visibility you've given us in your portfolio last night. Well, I think your share price is seeing at all. Thank you for that because it really takes a lot of boxes on inventory debts, cash breakevens, free cash flow capacity. It basically allows the market to value your company. So thanks to whoever had the initiative to do that is brilliant. So thanks for that. That's my first just general comment. I've got 2 questions, the information is never enough. So I guess like my first one would be on Slide #7. Can you give us some commodity benchmarks around your ranges just so we can book and what's going on in Slide 7 and that's my first one?Thomas E. JordenWhen you say commodity benchmarks?Douglas George Blyth LeggateThe inventory ranges you've given, Tom, are...Thomas E. JordenYes. Yes. No, I've got that in front of me, Doug. We have quite a bit of robustness in our inventory, and we typically run our inventory at multiple price files. I'm looking at a permutation in front of me that's run at $60 oil and $3 gas long term and $85 oil and $4.25 gas long term. Now I will say, when we go to $3 or less, we do assume some reduction in capital. And currently, we say -- if we're going to say $60 oil, $3 gas, we're going to take 70% of current capital expenditures. But the $85, $4.25 is at current cost. And so depending on where you want to cut it off, if I say, all right, how much of that hurdles at a 1.25 PVI10, which I think is a reasonable long-term inventory cutoff. We've been using 1.5 in a lot of our disclosure. But I'm going to give you 1.25. At $60 and $3, 75% of our total inventory would hurdle at a 1.25 PVI10. And at $85 and $4.25, 91% of our inventory would hurdle at a 1.25 PVI10. And again, at $85, $4.25, that is the current cost. So we have a fair amount of downside protection on this inventory.Douglas George Blyth LeggateGreat color. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate that. I guess my follow-up is I really just wanted to ask you to walk -- just the slight change in messaging or over share buybacks. I think you all know our view on variable dividends for a depleting business with a finite inventory. I won't get on my to box, but it seems that you guys are pivoting to recognize that there probably is some value in your stock here. So can you walk us through the investor feedback that you -- I think is how you described part of your decision to make that shift? And I'll leave it there.Thomas E. JordenWell, Doug, we've heard very mixed signals out of our investor base. I mean, some people want us to do A and some people want us to do B. We've also looked at the market response to the variable dividend, and I think that's a strong signal as to what the market is looking for. And then we listen to our critics, and we think about it, and we really do and have an honest attempt to get better and adopt the best approach. And we think that long term, buyback not only is the best acquisition opportunity in the market when we look at Coterra stock, but it's also highly accretive to our long-term owners, and that kind of checks 2 boxes. And so I won't tell you it was a casual decision to readjust our priorities, but we're very, very confident that in 2023, it's the right decision.OperatorYour next question is from David Deckelbaum of Cowen.David Adam DeckelbaumIf I could just dive into the Upper Marcellus a little bit just for my -- to better my understanding here. This year, it sounds like the mix is going to be higher relative to the overall upper versus lower mix in the next several years. So I guess, I'm curious, based on the wells that you have and the plan now in the upper, how much of the sort of resource do you think that you're going to be derisking this year relative to what you have sort of envisioned overall? And then how many of those locations are going to be in areas where the Lower Marcellus has already been depleted?Thomas E. JordenWell, I don't -- I can't have -- I don't have the answer at my fingertips as far as what we're going to derisk. We are trying to space our upper Marcellus pads around our asset, and we're developing a very good appreciation of how much of it will ultimately be developed. I will say that our viewpoint on that hasn't changed based on everything we've done and collected. There's a lot of drilling in the Upper Marcellus. What we're really experimenting with now is longer lateral length, well spacing, different completion designs and how it will behave when we put wells side by side. Thus far, we've had great feedback and it's not changed our viewpoint of the asset. And as far as the upper and lower mix in future years, that's governed by a lot of things. We still have a fair amount of lower left and we'll be pivoting back to it. That's more a function of our infrastructure availability, and we're trying to manage that so that we keep our line pressures reasonable, and we don't overdrive the system.David Adam DeckelbaumAnd I guess my follow-up to that is just as you look to that ramp of 100 million a day or so in the next couple of years, I suppose that assumes sort of similar activities in the Marcellus. So is that just reflecting a quality mix between having more of the lower and perhaps just better infrastructure availability?Thomas E. JordenYes. What I'm not following your 100 million a day, David?David Adam DeckelbaumSorry, I thought that I saw on your presentation that the implication was that you would get, call it from 3.8 to 3.9, yes.Thomas E. JordenYes. No, Yes, I see what you're saying. No, that's -- look, we would love to get our natural gas back on our growth profile, and that's just an outcome of our 3-year plan. It's just an outcome of the projects we're drilling, the staging of the completions and what we think it will deliver. It's also a function that the modest extra investments we're putting in the ground this year really do pay off in the next 2 years. So some of that is just fruits of seeds we're planning this year.OperatorYour next question is from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel.Derrick Lee WhitfieldCongrats on a strong year end. For my first question, I wanted to focus on your 2023 capital program. If we were to assume flat commodity price -- a flat commodity price environment, how would you expect service cost to change across your operating areas? And then more broadly, where are you seeing the greatest headwinds and tailwinds from a service cost component perspective?Blake A. SirgoYes, Derrick, this is Blake. I'll take that one. It's hard to pin service cost to a commodity price. I mean, it's really ultimately a function of activity and how much services are available on the market. We're seeing some softening. I'm happy to say, we've seen a little bit in rig rates here recently, and that's a good sign. We've seen a softening in casing our OCTG going out 3 to 6 months, we're starting to see some price coming down, and that's a good sign. But ultimately, it's going to be a function of activity across the lower 48. All rigs and crews have wheels and they will travel. So we'll see where activity goes.Derrick Lee WhitfieldTerrific. And just on my follow-up. Maybe shifting over to the Anadarko. Your well results on Slide 17 and 18 similarly beg for higher capital, particularly in the up-dip part of the play. Could you perhaps speak to the updates you've integrated in your design spacing at Leota Clark?Thomas E. JordenYes. Specifically, Leota Clark was an outgrowth of a lot of work we've done over the years. We did space those wells a little further apart. One of the things we also learned is to put our wells a little further away from parent wells and very, very pleased with the results. As we look ahead in our 3-year plan, the Anadarko has a few very, very nice projects this year, and then we take a little pause and then we start up January 1 of '24 with additional activity. But we're -- as you look at that inventory slide, these are high-quality locations, really begging for more capital, quite frankly. And the team is making it really hard for us. And as we ask them to do, they've come forward with some really, really nice projects in inventory. And we're just -- we're in the progress of trying to manage and embarrass from the riches.OperatorYour next question is from Matt Portillo of TPH.Matthew Merrel PortilloJust to tease out on kind of a consistent thread here, Tom. There's obviously a lot of interest from the broader market and gas capital allocation. So just wanted to circle back around to that. You mentioned the mid-cycle price on gas of $2.75. If that plays out, could you just give us a little bit of color on how you think about Marcellus capital allocation heading into 2024?And the reason we ask is we know you're very return-focused. And even at a $3.50 deck, the Permian still has better overall returns relative to the Marcellus based on your slides. So just curious if there's some flexibility in the program once you get through your service contracts, where the Marcellus may receive a little bit of -- a little less capital in 2024 if that $2.75 mid-cycle price plays out?Thomas E. JordenWell, if $2.75 were the price, I think that's probably something we'd look at seriously. Our current plan has fairly flat level of activity in the Marcellus and our intention is to (inaudible) but we look very carefully at the oil gas ratio and the return differential, and we're going to pivot and try to find the best returns within our portfolio. The oil gas ratio last year was 10:1. It's currently 30:1. And we talk about mid-cycle pricing. That mid-cycle ratio is really what we're looking at. And we don't want to react -- we don't want to need near term. we've got the wherewithal to be patient on this.Matthew Merrel PortilloThat makes sense. And then just a follow-up to the Marcellus. I know you guys have talked about the frac barrier and the ability to develop zones without co-development here. Could you just give us maybe a little bit of color on the program for the Upper Marcellus? I know you've talked about 40% for this year. But in the 3-year outlook, how should we be thinking about the percentage at a high level of the Upper Marcellus wells in that program in '24 and '25?Thomas E. JordenYes. It's -- in that 3-year plan, the Upper Marcellus is the highest percentage this year that we're currently projecting over the next 3 years. But in the out years, '24 and '25 and our current plan is the Upper Marcellus is going to be about 30% to 40% of our total program. And I will just reaffirm we stand by our statement that, that frac barrier is indeed a hydraulic isolation between the 2 units, which does give us the luxury to stage development in the most prudent way.OperatorYour next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities.Neal David DingmannMy first question, Tom, for you, again, is just on your Permian project size. And specifically, looked -- I was looking at that slide, it looks like now, what would you consider or -- would you consider kind of the 8 to 10 well pads now is the most optimal and was wondering does that increase due to sort of just overall cost out there, efficiencies or what has driven these larger project development?Thomas E. JordenWell, I'll chime in and then Blake will come in as well. We -- that 8 to 10 well project size, we didn't come up with that through some deep thinking. It kind of just happened. Operationally as we look at cycle times, we look at facility design, that seemed to be what looked to work. The Delaware is a little different beast than a lot of other basins you'll look at. We have a single pad in the Delaware that we're flowing back -- that is flowing back in excess of 200,000 barrels of water a day, that single project. And so pad design in Delaware is a function of a lot of things, one of which is infrastructure.Blake A. SirgoYes, I'll just tack on. Really, the wells per pad is an outcome of always looking for efficiency. That's really what we're constantly looking for on the cost side. The more wells per pad we get, the more (inaudible) we can do, it just drops our per well cost, our dollar per foot cost. Our teams have got really creative. We have pads now that have wells going to the north and wells going to the south. We come back, as Tom said, after those 200,000 barrels declines, and we added new zones and plugged those into the same facilities. Probably our biggest limit is just kickouts on drilling and there's a cost associated with that. And that's really our -- what we measure when we determine how many wells are we going to squeeze on one pad.Thomas E. JordenNeal, I want to correct myself that projects and pads -- one pad is producing 100,000 barrels a day. I was talking about a project. One pad is producing 100,000 barrels of water a day.Neal David DingmannEither way, that's big. That's great clarification. That's great.Thomas E. JordenIn Marcellus, we produce 5,000 barrels a day in the whole field.Neal David DingmannAll right. And then my second question is on your Marcellus delineation plan specifically. I think I saw in the release, you all mentioned about 40% of the Marcellus plan is delineation nature. Is this plan going to cover most of the broader position? Or are there some key areas that you're delineating. And then -- I know you're not going to give '24 guide, I'm not looking for that, but will that delineation continue to that percent as well into next year as well?Blake A. SirgoThis year, we are -- we do have a pretty good delineation across the field that we're testing Upper Marcellus in. Really, it's a function of takeaway and infrastructure too. We're careful where we bring that on. And you'll kind of see that theme in the upper as we go forward where we put those locations, similar to the lower, how we've done in the past. Infrastructure is a real guiding light there.Thomas E. JordenYes. Neal, I'm looking at the map right now of our Upper Marshall's projects. It's a pretty good scattershot over our acreage. So I think you'll all be pleased of our delineation. I also want to remind everybody that infrastructure is important in these plans, and we'll have a new compressor station opening here in the next year or 2 in the Marcellus, and that's always an opportunity for further extension.OperatorYour next question is from Kevin MacCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners.Kevin Moreland MacCurdyI was wondering if you could give some color on how you plan to execute the share buybacks? Will there be a set amount that you do each quarter based on your free cash flow? Or are you going to be more opportunistic based on your internal NAV?Scott C. SchroederYou're going to -- obviously, based on, like you said, the internal evaluations do, but we're going to continue to -- just like we did with the last one, be more -- focus more on the opportunistic look at the marketplace where we're trading versus our perception of where we should be trading. Again, we do have a commitment, but we're not going to become programmatic in doing it. So it will still be more opportunistic than anything else.Kevin Moreland MacCurdyGreat. And then just if I can, a question on the multiyear outlook. What would you say is the main driver of the increased oil production? Obviously, you're going to put on more wells, but are there any changes in productivity drilling in more productive areas or higher working interest areas that are contributing to that impressive growth?Thomas E. JordenWell, a huge driver is the extra capital we're putting in this year. We're setting some things up for next year that we're quite excited about. But look, we love our Delaware assets. We love all of our assets. And because of oil prices, it just makes sense to put that little extra effort forward this year and reap the rewards.OperatorYour next question is from Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM.Leo Paul MarianiI just wanted to ask a little bit about the CapEx outlook here. So you guys are talking about $2 billion to $2.2 billion this year in terms of the range. I was hoping to get a little bit of color around in terms of what puts you at the higher end versus the lower end? I'm assuming it might just be service costs. And then as I look at the 3-year outlook, you guys are expecting that to come in slightly to kind of more $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion in the next couple of years. So just wanted to get a sense of why that's coming down a little bit. Is there any expectation that service costs might come in? Obviously, you talked about some of the trends maybe starting to look favorable.Blake A. SirgoYes. I'll -- Leo, this is Blake. I'll take that one. The '23 program is all modeled at current cost and that would put us maybe just a little north of the midpoint, not assuming any deflation right now. So we'll see where that goes. The $2 billion to $2.1 billion going out in the next 3 years, it's really more a function of the project selection and the asset mix that comes in and comes out. Some parts of the assets have higher dollar per foot, some have lower, and that's just coming in and out throughout that 3-year program.Leo Paul MarianiOkay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you guys made about the variable dividend versus the buyback. Just wanted to get a sense -- I know you guys are going to continuously monitor this, but can we have an outcome this year where we get very, very little variable dividend and the buyback increases rather significantly versus kind of where it had been in the second half of 2022?Obviously, the stock while it's doing well today has come in quite a bit off the highs from last year or so. Just trying to get a sense if you guys are really going to kind of lean pretty hard on the buyback this year and do kind of very little on the variable dividend depending on how things play out?Blake A. SirgoLeo, I think that's a good assumption. The priority that we said is the base first, buyback second and then fill it, if needed, with the variable dividend. So to the core of your question, we're focused, particularly as we agree with you, our stock has come in quite a bit, and we see a great opportunity in that. So if you press me today, I would say your answer is the direction you're going correct.OperatorYour next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.Paul ChengTwo questions, please. One question is going back into the buyback and fixed dividend. After -- let's assume that later this year that you already raised your cash balance to $1 billion. And at that point, should we assume that the excess cash will be essentially both for the shareholder return. And that means that if you end up that going to be above 50% or even at that level that you may want to further strengthen your balance sheet. So trying to understand that once you reach that level, I mean, what kind of distribution that we should assume? Secondly, Tom, can you talk about -- you have a pretty huge inventory backlog already. So bolt-on acquisition is something that you guys think is attractive or that is important for you over the next couple of years or that you would be still focusing on your existing asset?Blake A. SirgoPaul, I'll take the first part. It's not that clear of a formula. As you watched us through this year, again our minimum commitment was 50-plus percent as we just highlighted, we returned 83%. So there's not a magic point that we get $1 billion in cash and then all of a sudden we start going. The $1 billion in cash is a target. The 50-plus percent of cash flow is a rule, so to speak, and then we have flexibility around how we deliver that and how much more we want to deliver based on market conditions. So you can't pinpoint to something that once we get to this point, we're going to start doing this. We have all those options on the table and we'll continue to use all those options. But the priorities right now is the 50-plus percent base dividend and buyback first, and we'd like to get our cash balance up because what the cash balance does being a little bit higher affords us flexibility in the question that you're asking, Tom.Thomas E. JordenAnd I'll take that question. Your inventory is always an important issue. As I've said in the past, having a long inventory really gives you the opportunity to run your program with only solid financial and operational considerations and not be panicked about some kind of a runway that's short. We have a very deep inventory, and we have the luxury of being able to run our program based on the best financial returns. That said, we're a learning organization and we're constantly looking for opportunities. We would love to find bolt-ons that we could handle our operational teams. We're very proud of our operational teams and their ability to integrate, operate smartly and really bring a hidden value forward. We're going to constantly look. But M&amp;A is a careless territory, where you typically want to have some advantage. That advantage can be information advantage, can be operational advantage, it could be geographic advantage. But we're probably not going to be showing up the auctions and trying to outbid people that have the same information we do. So we'll be opportunistic, but we're blessed with the luxury of not having to do something, and that's a nice place to be.OperatorYour next question is from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.Charles Arthur MeadeScott, I just have one more question on the buyback. And I know you guys have covered a lot of territory on it, but I think it's an important shift. And Scott, I know this is a conversation that you've engaged in for a long time. But the sense I get is that in the current environment, you guys are tilted hard towards the buyback, and I think you've been clear on that. My question is about whether you guys view this pivot as a durable pivot across time and also across price? And if you are thinking about it as a durable pivot, maybe you can share kind of up to what price you view it as being durable?Scott C. SchroederWell, Charles, that's a nice try. I won't give (inaudible). But I think it's fair to say it is more durable because you see the technical term, the stickiness of buybacks because it has a lasting impact over all cycles well into your future. I'd be lying if I didn't say I'd run the math in my head based on the average of what I bought in last year, if I had used that variable dividend money, what will my shares outstanding be. And that number kind of intrigues me. Now can't undo what we did last year. So I think where you're leaning is I view this as more durable because it is, I think, the best long-term solution. Now there will be points and disconnects in the market where it may not make sense. But I'd love to have that challenge where the whole perception is the market -- the stock got ahead of itself. We're a long ways away from that.Thomas E. JordenBut we are also going to make the best decision quarter-by-quarter and be prepared to pivot. We're not making some wholly pledged for all time. What we're saying is we're reaffirming our commitment to return cash to our owners and we think there's a better way to do it in 2023, and we're very confident with our move this morning.OperatorWe have completed the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Tom Jorden for closing remarks.Thomas E. JordenThank you all for joining us. We look forward to executing showing you that we're doing what we believe, and we're going to deliver what we promise. So thank you all very much.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

For more oil stocks, head on over to 5 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The oil and gas industry is one of the most important and lucrative sectors in the world. This is simply due to the nature of the product itself, with the marvels of internal combustion ensuring that whether it's transportation or power generation, some of the most crucial sectors of the global economy remain dependent on fossil fuels.Naturally, this criticality within the global economy also lends the industry some high valuations. For instance, a research report from Maximize Market Research outlines that the global crude oil market was worth $1.3 trillion in 2021 and from then until 2029 it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% to be worth an estimated $1.6 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that growth in the global population along with developments in the petrochemical and agricultural sectors will drive the industry forward. It adds that both Asia and North America will outpace the broader industry in terms of growth since the pair will each exhibit a 1.9% CAGR.Right now, the crude oil industry is battling to figure out what impact a Chinese economic recovery will have on the industry. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that while oil prices will increase to $100 per barrel, this will only happen in December this year due to higher supplies from the U.S. and Russia, longer winters, and a Chinese reopening. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), on the other hand, believes that oil demand this year can grow by a whopping 36%, based almost entirely on Chinese strength.Today, we'll take a look at which oil companies are popular with hedge funds, with the top picks being Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Story continues15 Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashOur Methodology We used Insider Monkey's collection of 943 hedge fund portfolios to determine which oil companies they had invested in as of the fourth quarter of last year.Best Oil Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Occidental Petroleum is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for OXY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.85 per share for OXY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for OXY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.96% heading into earnings season.Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOccidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOccidental Petroleum Corporation price-eps-surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that OXY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Occidental Petroleum, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

353,41ae2315-ab5f-37dc-a144-6e3c1bccf63c,OXY,2023-02-24,HF Sinclair (DINO) Q4 Preview: What Investors Can Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hf-sinclair-dino-q4-preview-130101410.html,1677157261,STORY,"['DINO', 'IGT', 'OXY']","[HF Sinclair Corporation DINO is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 24. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $3.59 per share on revenues of $7.6 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced this independent U.S. refiner’s results in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at DINO’s previous-quarter performance firstHighlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last-reported quarter, the Dallas, TX-based downstream operator eased past the consensus mark on strong margins and solid execution. DINO had reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.58, significantly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.20. Revenues of $10.6 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25.2%.HF Sinclair beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 695.8%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:HF Sinclair Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseHF Sinclair Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseHF Sinclair Corporation price-eps-surprise | HF Sinclair Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a massive 3,363.6% surge year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 35.6% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderDINO is expected to have benefited from the strength in refining margins. In the third quarter of 2022, the company’s refining gross margin of $31.47 per barrel jumped from $14.87 a year ago. Moreover, throughput rose from 444,730 barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter of 2021 to 685,120 bpd.Despite softening from the spectacular highs of the June quarter, the overall positive momentum is most likely to have continued in the fourth quarter, thanks to the strength in fuel demand on the back of rebounding road and airline travel, which pushed up crude differentials and margins. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HF Sinclair’s Refining segment operating income is pegged at $895 million, turning around from the prior-year quarter’s loss of $63 million. This is likely to have buoyed the fourth-quarter results of HF Sinclair.On a somewhat bearish note, though, HF Sinclair’s total operating costs and expenses in the third quarter more than doubled year over year to $9.3 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported period due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that HF Sinclair is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: DINO has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $3.59 per share each.Zacks Rank: HF Sinclair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for HF Sinclair, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:International Game Technology PLC IGT has an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Feb 28.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For 2022, International Game Technology has a projected earnings growth rate of 609.7%.

354,2f9f0ec4-990d-3203-8a17-8eb13adb747c,OXY,2023-02-24,Invest Like Warren Buffett With These ETFs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-warren-buffett-etfs-130001789.html,1677157201,STORY,"['USB', 'BRK-A', 'CVX', 'OXY', 'ATVI', 'AAPL']","[Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is known for his value investing style. Many want to mirror the legend’s investing strategy and emerge a winner. Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13-F filing showed that Berkshire’s $299 billion portfolio was invested in 49 companies in the fourth quarter of 2022, unchanged from last quarter.The top five holdings make up about 75% of the total portfolio, per an article published on Forbes. These five stocks are Apple AAPL, Bank of America BAC, Chevron CVX, Coca-Cola KO, and American Express AXP. Apart from these, Berkshire has significant weights in Occidental Petroleum OXY and Kraft Heinz KHC.Let’s delve a little deeper.Buffet Loves AppleBuffett is outright bullish on Apple AAPL. Berkshire Hathaway now owns a 5.8% stake in Apple, as of Dec 31, according to the company's Schedule 13G filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday, as quoted on investors.com.Investors intending to follow Buffett and be part of Apple’s growth story, can play ETFs like iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW, Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK and Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT.Taiwan Semiconductor Falls From Buffett’s FavorBuffett is now less confident about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares. Berkshire Hathaway said it had about 8.3 million American depository shares of TSMC worth $618 million, having sold 86% of its shares. Last month, the chipmaker offered a subdued forecast on prospects for 2023 given the global growth slowdown.So, investors following Buffett may opt to stay away from the likes of VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH as the fund has about 11.6% weight in TSMC. Invesco BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund ADRE also has about 22.2% weight on the stock.Be Choosy on BanksBerkshire slashed its US Bancorp USB investment from 52.5 million shares to 6.7 million by the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway also cut its investment in Bank of New York Mellon BK and sold off more than 37 million shares during the quarter and remained with 25 million shares of the bank.Story continuesU.S. Bancop has about 10% exposure to iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF IAT while both bank stocks have decent weights in IAT and Davis Select Financial ETF DFNL. However, Berkshire is heavyweight on Bank of America, which is heavy on Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB.Are Energy ETFs Slowly Losing Value?Berkshire Hathaway has bet big on the energy companies over the last two years, scooping up loads of Chevron and Occidental Petroleum shares. But in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company sold 1%, or 2.4 million shares, of its Chevron position.Chevron is heavy on energy ETFs like Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE and iShares U.S. Energy ETF IYE. Meanwhile, Berkshire now controls more than 20% of the outstanding shares in Occidental. Occidental Petroleum Corporation has about 6.37% invested in First Trust Nasdaq Oil &amp; Gas ETF FTXN. Whatever the case be, a small stake selling in Chevron and still a heavy weight in Occidental say that the energy ETFs are still in fine fettle.Buffett Trims ATVI: Should You Dump e-Sprots ETFs?Berkshire reduced its holdings of Activision Blizzard ATVI. The stock has 5% to 6% weights in Global X Video Games &amp; Esports ETF HERO and VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF ESPO. Investors should not lose hopes on e-Sports ETFs on the ATVI news as Buffett discussed before that the Activision’s share purchase was a merger arbitrage opportunity, as ATVI was going to be merged with Microsoft.Since the European Union has raised some objections to Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, the likelihood of successful closure of the deal has weakened. Despite selling roughly another $600 million worth in the fourth quarter, Activision remains Berkshire’s ninth-largest holding, the Forbes article notified.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ARHS) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, both Arhaus, Inc. and Ulta Beauty are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ARHS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.64, while ULTA has a forward P/E of 21.86. We also note that ARHS has a PEG ratio of 0.97. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ULTA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.59.Another notable valuation metric for ARHS is its P/B ratio of 11.94. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ULTA has a P/B of 14.06.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help ARHS earn a Value grade of B, while ULTA has been given a Value grade of C.Both ARHS and ULTA are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ARHS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Ulta Beauty (ULTA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ULTA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Ulta Beauty's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Ulta Beauty's main business drivers.Bolingbrook, IL-based, Ulta Beauty Inc., previously known as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &amp; Fragrance, Inc., is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. Founded in 1990, the company changed its name to Ulta Beauty in January 2017.The company offers a wide range of products including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. It sells more than 25,000 products from about 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points. We note that the company's skincare category has been standing out in particular for a while now, given consumers' rising consciousness.Meanwhile, the beauty products retailer also provides private label products comprising Ulta Beauty Collection branded cosmetics, skincare, and bath products. Additionally, the company operates a full-service salon in every store offering hair, skin and brow services. Additionally, it offers products through its Website, ulta.com, as well as mobile applications. The products offered by the company include the prestige and mass beauty brands.As part of its value proposition, Ulta Beauty provides a range of loyalty programs through its Customer Relationship Management platform. It also offers frequent promotions, coupons, in-store events and gifts. The company also makes use of a range of media platforms to advertise products as well as generate awareness. The company strives to boost distribution center capabilities to better support store footfall and online demand.Story continuesThe company has a strong vendor base and holds partnerships with companies such as Estee Lauder, L’Oréal and Shiseido. Ulta Beauty works closely with vendors to provide improved growth platforms for new and existing brands.As of Oct 29, 2022, Ulta Beauty operated 1,343 stores. For fiscal 2022, the company expects 47 net new stores and 33 store remodeling and relocation projects.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Ulta Beauty, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2013 would be worth $6,031.91, or a 503.19% gain, as of February 23, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 163.33% and the price of gold went up 10.91% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for ULTA.Ulta Beauty has outpaced the industry in the past three months. The company has been benefiting from its omnichannel strength, especially buy online, pickup in store. Also, the skin care category has been gaining from consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s product newness. These upsides aided third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed growth in all major categories, and all its store and digital channels. Ulta Beauty also saw a higher market share in prestige beauty compared with the year-ago period. Considering the third-quarter performance and anticipations for the fourth quarter, management raised its fiscal 2022 view. However, it expects SG&amp;A deleverage and increased supply-chain costs to persist in fiscal 2022.Shares have gained 5.67% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

360,00e031e7-6c86-31eb-b3e4-c5b3f4053d46,VRTX,2023-02-24,Will Weakness in Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporateds-nasdaq-120023723.html,1677240023,STORY,['VRTX'],"[With its stock down 7.2% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:24% = US$3.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.24 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 24% ROETo begin with, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 24% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Given the circumstances, the significant 26% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals over the last five years is not surprising.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Vertex Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 28% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is VRTX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

MRNA reported earnings of $3.61 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $4.66 and $4.48, respectively. Earnings declined 68% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line was due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses incurred during the fourth quarter.Revenues in the quarter were $5.08 billion, which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.09 billion. Total revenues were down 29.5% year over year due to declining COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter. The total revenues were in line with our model estimates.Moderna’s shares were down 3.4% in pre-market trading on Feb 23, likely due to the lower-than-anticipated earnings reported by management. In the past year, the stock has inched up 1.2% against the industry’s 8.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailProduct sales, entirely from the sale of COVID-19 vaccines, were down 30.0% year over year to $4.86 billion due to lower sales volume compared with the year-ago period’s levels.Grant and collaboration revenues were $225 million compared with $276 million in the year-ago quarter. The company earns collaboration revenues from agreements with several big pharma/biotech companies, including Merck MRK and Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $375 million, up 87% year over year. The upside can be attributed to increased spending in commercialization activities to support the company’s marketed products.Research &amp; development expenses were $1.2 billion, up 87% from the year-ago period’s levels. The significant increase was primarily attributable to higher clinical costs and personnel-related expenses.The company ended the quarter with $18.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $17.0 billion as of Sep 30, 2022.Full-Year ResultsModerna reported revenues of $19.3 billion for 2022, up 4.3% year over year.Story continuesFor the full year, the company reported earnings of $20.12, down 29% year over year.2023 GuidanceModerna reiterated its product revenue guidance for 2023. Management expects to record a minimum of around $5.0 billion from COVID vaccine sales in 2023, based on confirmed advance purchase agreements and contract deferrals. Management also reported that this figure does not include product sales in the United States or new contracts with Europe, Japan and other key markets. The company expects to record approximately $2.0 billion in product sales in first-half 2023.The company maintained combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses to be approximately $6 billion in 2022, with approximately $4.5 billion in R&amp;D. It expects capital expenditure to be around $1.0 billion.Pipeline UpdatesCurrently, Moderna has 48 programs in active development, with 38 programs undergoing clinical studies.Moderna has three late-stage candidates — mRNA-1647, mRNA-1345 and mRNA-1010 — in its pipeline, which are being developed as cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and influenza vaccine, respectively.Last month, management announced that the pivotal phase III ConquerRSV study evaluating mRNA-1345 achieved the primary efficacy endpoints. Based on this result, management expects to submit for regulatory approval of mRNA-1345 in first-half 2023.Earlier this month, Moderna reported mixed interim data from a pivotal phase III study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity study of mRNA-1010 in adults. While the vaccine showed promise against the influenza A virus, it did not show any improvement against the influenza B virus. Management is currently waiting for data from another ongoing late study on mRNA-1010 to determine its next steps. A decision is expected by the end of first-quarter 2023.Last December, Moderna and partner Merck announced data from the phase IIb KEYNOTE-942 study evaluating their personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) candidate as an adjuvant treatment in melanoma patients. Data from the study showed that the PCV candidate, when combined with Merck’s blockbuster drug, Keytruda exhibited a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 44%. Based on this data, Moderna and Merck plan to start a late-stage study in adjuvant melanoma later this year.Alongside its earnings results, Moderna also announced that its partner Vertex initiated a phase I study evaluating VX-522, an investigational mRNA-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) indication. While Vertex Pharmaceuticals is responsible for leading the preclinical and clinical development of therapies, Moderna is responsible for mRNA and lipid nanoparticle process development and manufacturing.

The donation comes after Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan H. Shaw visited East Palestine, where he heard concerns from residents first-hand. Each of the district's three schools — East Palestine Elementary, East Palestine Middle, and East Palestine High schools — will receive $100,000.Norfolk Southern Corporation Logo (PRNewsfoto/Norfolk Southern Corporation)On Tuesday, Shaw met with Dwayne Pavkovich, athletic director and assistant principal; Sarai Dutton, principal of East Palestine Elementary School; and Tony DelBoccio, principal of East Palestine High School, to hear concerns they had following the Feb. 3 derailment and to inform them of the donation. The school officials and Shaw discussed many issues. One issue centered around the cancellation of athletic events as a result of the incident.East Palestine schools have been cleared by local, state, and federal officials to safely host athletic and extra-curricular activities; however, schools outside the district have voluntarily forfeited games set to be held within the district. These cancellations have caused a loss of revenue for East Palestine sports programs and neighboring businesses.""As soon as I heard that the East Palestine Bulldogs were not able to play in revenue-generating games, we took immediate action to help this community. We continue to be committed to helping East Palestine residents get back on their feet. We are in this community for the long haul, and our goal is to see the community thrive again,"" said Shaw.Norfolk Southern has committed that this initial donation of $300,000 to the East Palestine City School District will be followed by additional, future financial support.Story continuesOn the same day, Norfolk Southern reimbursed the Village of East Palestine Fire Department approximately $825,000 for fire equipment used in the derailment response.

NTSB investigators have worked tirelessly, and we appreciate everything they are doing. We share the NTSB Chair's frustration about the significant misinformation about the incident.Norfolk Southern will continue to support the NTSB's investigation. Their preliminary report indicates:The rail crew operated the train within the company's rules.The rail crew operated the train below the track speed limit.The wayside heat detectors were operating as designed.Once the rail crew was alerted by the wayside detector, they immediately began to stop the train.The company's wayside detectors on its network trigger an alarm at a temperature threshold that is among the lowest in the rail industry.At Norfolk Southern, our highest priority is the safety of our people and the communities and customers we serve. Under the supervision of the Federal Railroad Administration, the company has inspected all wayside detectors in the area of the incident and found they were operating as designed. Out of an abundance of caution, Norfolk Southern is now inspecting all of the nearly 1,000 wayside heat detectors on its system – on top of the regular inspection of the detectors every 30 days.We and the rail industry need to learn as much as we can from this event. Norfolk Southern will develop practices and invest in technologies that could help prevent an incident like this in the future. We will also work with the owners of the rail cars on the integrity and safety of the equipment we use.The speculation and misinformation about this incident have been extremely upsetting to the citizens of East Palestine. Norfolk Southern remains committed to the people of the community and will continue its work to help them thrive. Already, we have made significant progress in cleaning the site, engaging the community, and providing financial support for families and small businesses, all to help East Palestine.Story continuesAbout Norfolk SouthernSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and its predecessor companies have moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy.

378,1ad456fd-337a-39e3-81cd-b564701301a8,KO,2023-02-24,13 Most Profitable Food Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-most-profitable-food-stocks-151915341.html,1677165555,STORY,"['KHC', 'HSY', 'ADM', 'KO', 'PEP', 'NSRGF', 'GIS', 'TSN', 'MDLZ', 'WLMIY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the thirteen most profitable food stocks. For more food companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Stocks. The food industry is one of the most crucial sectors in the world, and one that is also often thought of as a harbor against recession. The reasoning for this argues that during an economic downturn, while consumers will reduce their luxury spending, and put off buying an iPhone for example, they still have to buy food. Additionally, the food industry is also one of the largest in the world since it does not have to worry about creating demand and instead has to think of innovative ways to manage demand and out compete rivals in business processes such as logistics and supply chain management.Taking a look at the monetary estimates of the industry, a research report from Fortune Business Insights spells out the sheer scale of the sector. Zoning in on the food processing market, it points out that the sector was worth a whopping $2.3 trillion in 2021, and adds that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% to be worth an estimated $5.1 trillion by 2029.The sector's strength is evidenced by this CAGR, as trillion dollar industries generally do not have growth rates that end up exceeding 5%. The research firm outlines that the market growth will be supported by several trends, such as the growth in vegetarian diets, the surge in migration to cities, an increase in online ordering, and higher disposable incomes to spend on dining out.Today, we will take a look at some of the most profitable food companies in the world, and some of them are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Nestlé S.A.

""With no centrally approved treatment option currently available in the EU, this positive opinion marks a significant milestone for the vitiligo community.""The CHMP opinion recommending the approval of ruxolitinib cream was based on data from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream versus vehicle (non-medicated cream) in more than 600 people with non-segmental vitiligo, age 12 and older1. Results from the TRuE-V program, recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed that treatment with ruxolitinib cream resulted in significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation versus vehicle as shown by the number of patients reaching the facial and total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI-T-VASI) endpoints at Week 24 compared to vehicle, with a higher proportion of patients responding at Week 521. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) were application site acne, application site pruritus, nasopharyngitis, headache, urinary tract infection, application site erythema, and pyrexia2.Story continuesThe CHMP’s opinion is now being reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant centralized marketing authorizations for medicinal products in the EU. When approved, this will be the first approved vitiligo therapy available in the EU indicated for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.""Given its complex pathogenesis and unpredictable progression, vitiligo can be very challenging for dermatologists to treat,"" said Thierry Passeron M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology, Université Côte d'Azur in Nice, France and one of the lead investigators of the TRUE-V trials. ""I welcome today’s news and look forward to the potential approval of an effective therapy that can address repigmentation, providing a much-needed option for those patients living with vitiligo who are actively seeking treatment, as well as the clinical community dedicated to its treatment.""About VitiligoVitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by depigmentation of skin that results in patchy loss of skin color from the progressive destruction of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Overactivity of the JAK signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of vitiligo. In Europe, approximately 1.5 million patients are diagnosed with vitiligo (0.2 to 0.8% of the population3,4), and its overall prevalence is estimated to be less than 1%, with the majority of patients (approximately 8 in 10) suffering from non-segmental vitiligo5. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 306. Vitiligo not only impacts physical health but also places a heavy burden on quality of life including employment and psychosocial health such as depression.About TRuE-VThe TRuE-V clinical trial program includes two Phase 3 studies, TRuE-V1 (NCT04052425) and TRuE-V2 (NCT04057573), evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo. Each study enrolled approximately 300 patients (age ≥12 years) who have been diagnosed with non-segmental vitiligo.About Ruxolitinib Cream (Opzelura™)Ruxolitinib cream (Opzelura™), a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States. Opzelura is also approved in the U.S. for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura. In April 2022, Incyte entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. for the development, manufacturing and exclusive commercialization of ruxolitinib cream for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory dermatology indications in Japan.Opzelura is a trademark of Incyte.About Incyte DermatologyIncyte’s science-first approach and expertise in immunology has formed the foundation of the company. Today, we are building on this legacy as we discover and develop innovative dermatology treatments to bring solutions to patients in need.Our research and development efforts in dermatology are initially focused on leveraging our knowledge of the JAK-STAT pathway.

GoodarziGreat. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As you read in our press release, we announced that Michelle will step down from the CFO role and plans to retire from Intuit. I'm pleased to share that Sandeep Aujla will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on August 1, 2023. It is a well-crafted succession plan that will cover more in a few minutes, but let's first get started with the business.We had another strong quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew 14%, fueled by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 20% and Consumer revenue growth of 26%.This year, we are celebrating Intuit's 40th anniversary. We're incredibly proud of our history of reimagining the company and reinventing ourselves, which has enabled us to thrive during various technological shifts and economic cycles.Having successfully navigated multiple platform shifts over the years, including our largest transformation to artificial intelligence in the era of digitization, we continue to be confident in our ability to fuel growth given our large TAM, low penetration, proven strategy and 5 Big Bets. We are proud to be the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities that we serve.I will first start with some thoughts about the tax season and our business in the current macro environment. As you know, the scale of our platform and rich data gives us unique insights into the lives and spending habits of 100 million-plus customers.Our small business performance continues to be very strong despite uncertainty in the broader macro environment. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including the growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC.In Q2, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remains strong. Total online payments volume grew 25%, moderating some from the first quarter. We are seeing strong growth in the number of payment-enabled invoices sent by our small business customers, a good sign that our innovation is continuing to drive digitization.The shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, resonate with customers as they grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to observe that our AI-driven expert platform is critical to our customers' success.Now turning to tax. We're confident in our strategy to both extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category. Following a highly successful extension season last year, we doubled down on our learnings to further accelerate innovation to better serve our customers.First, we're evolving our TurboTax brand to increase awareness that we are the best alternative in the assisted tax segment for consumers and small businesses, a combined $30 billion TAM. Our new campaign, Come to TurboTax and Don't Do Your Taxes is resonating with our customers and is the key to our strategy as we focus on attracting customers from the assisted segment.Second, we launched a number of high-impact TurboTax Live innovation. As part of our second Big Bet, we are solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. Building on our learnings from last season, we're continuing to use AI to bring in our customers' data and match them to the right experts to help customers get the maximum refund they deserve with confidence.To help customers finish their taxes even more quickly. We've created a new gamified experience focused on efficiency backed by our lifetime guarantee. We evolved our Full Service offerings so filers can have their return completed in a single virtual session. We are off to a great start in tax, and we continue to be confident in our game plan to win.Now shifting to our 5 Big Bets, I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress. As a reminder, our Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. In addition to what I've shared about TurboTax Live, we've achieved product market fit with QuickBooks Live, which we expect could help us penetrate non-consumption and drive breakthrough adoption. We're evolving our QuickBooks Live into a portfolio of expert services and are embedding these services as part of our lineup, similar to TurboTax Live.In the second quarter, we launched a 3 expert-guided setup available for all new QBO customers leveraging our virtual expert platform. Early results indicate that customers using this offering have more confidence in and awareness of our full ecosystem of services, which translate into better retention and higher adoption of our service offerings.With our third Big Bet, our vision for Credit Karma is to become the comprehensive self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds.I'll share a few examples. We're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress, including improving their credit score with the help of Credit Karma Money. For example, with the integration of TurboTax and Credit Karma, approved members can get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepts their return.As this is the largest paycheck of the year for many, this enables them to take care of immediate expenses, pay down debt or build savings. Members also receive recommendations for how to achieve their financial goals, such as creating an emergency savings fund with our high-yield savings account or building credit with credit builder. Members who activate credit builders see an average score increase of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days. Members who use Credit Karma Money show higher engagement on the Credit Karma platform.We are driving more confidence for members with Karma Guarantee. As a reminder, Karma Guarantee offers indicate that members will either be approved or they'll receive $50. At the end of the quarter, 59% of members were eligible for at least one Karma Guarantee offer.With Mint now part of the Credit Karma platform, we're beginning to build a new experience for members with prime credit scores, which Credit Karma is underpenetrated in today. Leveraging Mint, we see the opportunity to develop personalized product recommendations, leveraging net worth, transaction and spend data to highlight the product benefits that matter most to these members.Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We continue to innovate to digitize money movement from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid.Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, and we are making meaningful progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow.We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. This quarter, we launched a QuickBooks business network to millions of QuickBooks customers to further digitize B2B payments in the U.S. We're also building our bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future.Now turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach.This quarter, we made some great progress against these priorities. To help our small business customers run and grow their business in one place, we launched a real-time data sync that brings QBO data such as invoices, sales receipts, items, customers and addresses into Mailchimp. This puts customer and purchase data together all in one place to power our customers' success.To help our customers plan, execute and track their marketing campaigns across multiple channels in one place, we launched a new capability called Campaign Manager. This reduces the number of tools needed to manage marketing and assess performance across channels. And to drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages, including Spanish and Portuguese.And beyond the progress we've made on these priorities, the product lineup innovation, assisted onboarding and improved first-time use we shared last quarter is driving green shoots in paid conversion, which was up 2 points year-over-year in the second quarter.Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. As I mentioned earlier, online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we are seeing increased adoption of QBO Advanced payments and payroll driving ARPC expansion as we serve these customers across our full ecosystem of services.Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. And in an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever to our customers. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.Michelle M. ClatterbuckThanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $3 billion; GAAP operating income of $270 million versus $56 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $856 million versus $612 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60 versus $0.35 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.20 versus $1.55 last year.Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and Online Ecosystem revenue grew 24%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 27% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q2.Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter was up low teens. Growth was driven by higher effective prices, aligning with our pricing for value philosophy and improving conversion.We will continue to provide regular updates on the business so you can track our performance over time, including a deeper dive at Investor Day, similar to what we do for the rest of the business. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer.Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 17% in Q2. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter.The subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with pricing for value. We're about halfway through the 3-year transition to a subscription model for desktop.QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high teens during the quarter. We expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth as we progress through the back half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward.We remain confident in our guidance for total Small Business and Self-Employed Group of 19% to 20% revenue growth this year. Consumer Group revenue of $516 million grew 26% in Q2, reflecting a faster forming season this year. We remain confident in our guidance for Consumer Group of 9% to 10% revenue growth for fiscal 2023.Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue grew 7% in Q2, in line with our expectations. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, down 16%. This was slightly ahead of our expectations in its seasonally smaller quarter. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022.On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. We continue to see an impact across all verticals in this uncertain macro environment.In credit cards, we continue to see partners tighten eligibility in riskier cohorts. In personal loans, we continue to see pressure as partners further tighten eligibility, and we expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We remain confident in our guidance of a decline of 15% to 10% in fiscal 2023.Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $7.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $500 million of stock during the second quarter.Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable April 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.As I shared consistently in the past several quarters, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth.The scale of our platform, along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play off it. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength.Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%.Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.82 to $6.89, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.42 to $8.49. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.On a personal note, as we announced today, I will be stepping down as CFO on July 31, and made it a priority over the last several years to focus on our long-term strategy for driving growth, and that includes ensuring I have a high-performing finance team with strong succession plans in place.Sandeep has been an integral part of the finance leadership team for over 7 years, and I have no doubt he will be a terrific leader and CFO. He has shown his ability to drive key strategic priorities to create value for our business time and time again, and I look forward to working with him over the next 5 months to ensure a seamless transition. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.Sasan K. GoodarziGreat. Thank you, Michelle. Well, while the CFO transition isn't official until August, I wanted to just take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for all that Michelle has contributed over the past 20 years at Intuit, including the last 5 years as CFO. She has been an amazing partner and will leave Intuit better than what she found it, and during Michelle's tenure as CFO, Intuit's market cap and revenue more than doubled.Michelle's commitment to developing top and diverse talent has created a deep bench of strong leaders, making for a very seamless transition. Sandeep will be an exceptional CFO, with his track record of leading outstanding performance across our Small Business and Self-Employed Group and our technology organizations.So with that, let me go ahead and summarize. We are seeing continued momentum as we execute on our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform and growing Intuit revenue double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the additions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities.We're proud that Intuit has been named #5 on Fortune's Most Admired Company in the software category, one of Glassdoor's 2023 Best Places to Work, and honored to be included among JUST Capital's Just 100 ranking for 2023. With that, let's now open it up to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.Chirag Haresh VedThis is Chirag Ved dialing in for Kirk. Congratulations on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about what you're seeing in QuickBooks Online growth, both from new customers and from upselling existing customers, just any commentary you might be able to provide around the dynamics there.Sasan K. GoodarziYes, sure. Thank you for the question. I would lead with we're seeing strength both in terms of customer acquisition, retention. We are seeing strength in our services. As we mentioned a moment ago, both the number of companies that are running payroll, the number of employees that are getting paid is very strong.We're -- if you compare our results to what you're seeing in the marketplace, we are continuing to grow payments 25%, total payments charge volume, which is really outstanding because of the fact that our customers are continuing to benefit from digitizing on our platform.And I think just the additive piece is we're seeing strength in mid-market, which is much higher ARPC, and we're quite excited about really being able to pursue non-consumption with what we talked about earlier with QuickBooks Live actually being embedded as part of our overall offering.And I would just end with one of the goals that we talked about with all of you 4 years ago, our bold 2025 goals. One of those goals was that we wanted the success rate of small businesses on our platform to be 10 points better than industry, and in fact, the small businesses on our platform, their performance is north of 15 points better than anyone in the industry.And what that just suggests is that the small businesses on our platform are more successful, they're digitizing and they're leveraging this opportunity to continue to accelerate to deliver for their customers.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.Sitikantha PanigrahiSasan, it's a great quarter. I think what's impressive is your small business growth in this macro environment, like when some of your peers are talking about like push out of digital transformation and small business, some weakness.So I just wanted to ask what you were seeing in terms of like for the next few quarters. Like you look at a lot of data. What kind of -- what sort of health you are seeing in the SMB economy right now? And it looks like your second half is pretty easy comp right now. So would love to hear your comments on small business.Sasan K. GoodarziYes, for sure, Siti. Thank you so much for your question. And it's actually a really important question in terms of what we've often talked about, which is it's important that you all look at Intuit as really the authority when it comes to what's happening in the small business space. And the reason is that our platform is mission-critical for small businesses.Our platform with QuickBooks, Mailchimp and all the services that we have on our platform is really used by small businesses to be able to grow customers, manage their customers, manage their cash flow, be able to manage their employees end-to-end. And therefore, what that means is it fuels our success, supported by the stat I shared a moment ago, where small businesses that are on our platform are actually 15-plus points more successful than those that are not on our platform.And so I set that very important context, and I'll just point to payments total charge volume as an example. When you look at our performance being at 25%, that is, by far, the best in the industry. And that is because it is all about digitization. And it's not just about payments, but it's about all the services that our small businesses use on our platform. And we expect our small businesses to continue to be successful even in this macro environment, and we are here to support them.I will just end by saying the following, which I think you were hinting at this in your question. The strength of our businesses, as Michelle and I described a moment ago, and we expect that strength to continue, although when you look at our guidance, I think the way you should look at our guidance is that it has been de-risked, for sure, for the rest of the year.Sitikantha PanigrahiGreat. And a quick follow-up, basically clarification. Your Online Services growth, 21%, but if I exclude Mailchimp, it's around 27% growth. That's quite impressive, like just compared to like Q1, 28%. Just wanted to clarify that I'm looking at it right.Sasan K. GoodarziYou are. We didn't break out the number, but yes, you're looking at it right, because, in essence, Online Services minus Mailchimp grew faster. So therefore, just by design, it grew much faster than 21%. So you are correct.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo.Michael James TurrinGreat. Nice job on the quarter. Maybe one for Michelle, while you're still with us, on margin. Last quarter, you took the Credit Karma outlook down but left the EPS guide intact. We've gotten questions from investors around whether that provides maybe less wiggle room on margin, but the first couple of quarters have still shown EPS upside.So can you just walk through the margin levers you're finding? Are there advantages in folding various brands together? And just how we should think about the longer-term margin potential there?Michelle M. ClatterbuckYes. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate the question. We -- yes, we absolutely have felt very strongly about being able to still keep our guidance for op income, for margin, even though we did take down our revenue guidance last quarter. And that's actually something that we were very planful about as we went through our 3-year planning process.We had identified a number of levers that we could pull across the expense horizon. A lot of that is in marketing. Some of it's in travel and some other discretionary-type expenses so that we would be able to still hit our bottom line financial commitments, and that's what we have done.And we feel very good about the guidance that we've given for the rest of the year, but it is something that we take very seriously, and we make sure that we do have those levers that we can pull, given different macro environments as that has unfolded this year.Michael James TurrinIt's very helpful. Just one more, if I may. The desktop business came in exceptionally strong. Can you just speak to what you're finding as you move that base for subscription? And then how to think about the revised small business target after we're through the migration journey there, and what keeps the 15% growth sustained afterwards.Sasan K. GoodarziSure, Michael, maybe I will take that. First of all, I'll just start with context. This is a business model shift that we're actually quite excited about in that, one, we've shifted the customers to subscription, so it's far more predictable. Two, in that context, we have had a very planful process of aligning prices between desktop and our online products.And the reason this is really important is we've been heavily investing in the last several years, really ensuring that some of the key capabilities for our desktop customers, particularly those product-based businesses, that those capabilities are available in online.And being in the middle of this business model transition, one, we see another 1.5 years of continued strength, but we also see ahead of that the fact that we can now migrate these customers through our online platform because we now have the capabilities that they need. And by the way, when we do that, that actually opens up the doors to additional Online Services to continue to fuel the success of our small businesses.And therefore, when you step back, ultimately, the growth of this franchise will come from online. And with all of the innovation growth levers we have moving upmarket, that is what continues to give us a lot of confidence in our 15% to 20% long-term expectations for the small business franchise.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan.Mark Ronald MurphyI'll add my congratulations. I was wondering if you can drill down into the favorable trend that you're seeing from higher effective prices, in particular, for QuickBooks Online Accounting, just in terms of the magnitude and the duration of that impact. And I'm curious if that should continue to provide any kind of material uplift for the next several quarters.Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thanks for your question, Mark. Let me start with context that we always look at our largest growth across the company, no matter what the business is, is to come from volume and mix. And those 2 are driven, of course, by our innovation and/or if we are moving upmarket, which in many cases across our businesses, we are moving upmarket. In TurboTax, the example is moving into the assisted segment.So price and mix are really the largest drivers. And because of just the vast and accelerated innovation, we also have price as a leverage because we always want to be disruptive from the bottom, and we want to continue to disrupt at the top. And that actually gives us a lot of pricing power because of the value equation and the benefits that we deliver for our customers.And so with that as context, looking ahead, not just the next couple of quarters, but looking in terms of just the long-term durability of Intuit and how we think about things, we believe the majority of our growth will continue to come from volume and mix, and price will always be a lever because particularly that we are moving upmarket.And I think it was even more pronounced in small business because of the business model shift in desktop, where we are bringing pricing to parity with online, and we just -- we expect that to continue in the next several quarters, but that there's a durability element of this, not just a quarterly element for this.Mark Ronald MurphyOkay. Understood. And then as a quick follow-up, on the Mailchimp side, are the initiatives that are designed to stimulate higher growth for Mailchimp, which I think has been including the very creative advertising campaigns you've had out there, are those starting to take hold and produce an effect in terms of whether we look at e-mail marketing, campaign volumes or seeing customers opt in to the right products there to where they run the A/B test and kind of connect back with the rest of the ecosystem. Is that something you see starting to take hold currently or in the next couple of quarters as well?Sasan K. GoodarziYes, Mark, I would say that when you think about the priorities that we talked about in the focus areas, we are starting to see green shoots, and we started seeing green shoots a couple of quarters ago, and sort of the biggest one is conversion in paid.The one in addition to the initiatives starting to deliver green shoots that we are the most excited about is the work that we are doing to retain our high-value customers and to really penetrate in mid-market.This is really the same story that we talked about in mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced, where our retention was actually not quite that high when it came to our high-value customers in QuickBooks. And we built a platform and really a team to focus on these mid-market customers.And that is really one that I'm very excited about, and I think we'll see the results of that in the next 2 to 3 quarters, where we'll start making a bigger impact and not only retaining our high-value customers, but also penetration in mid-market.That's also in context of all the other things that we've talked about doing, which is campaign redesign, web redesign, first-time use, 1-hour assisted onboarding, and now what we just shared earlier in the script, which we said it's coming, and that is the data sync. The data sync is huge because now it puts the customer data and purchase data all in one place, and it really puts the power of growth in the hands of customers in a way where they can't get that fuel anywhere else.And so all these things take time, but we are seeing the green shoots. It will translate into faster revenue growth sort of in the coming quarters, which is, by the way, not embedded in our guidance, just to be clear, but we're excited about the progress that we're making.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank.Brad Alan ZelnickExcellent. Sasan, I think everyone appreciates what's happening in Credit Karma, and there's only so much that's within your control. And within that context, it's great to hear all the goodness around how Credit Karma Guarantee is doing.But as we think about the other elements of the portfolio, the other products, in an environment that's supply-constrained, can you maybe just talk about the performance and how you're investing against the opportunity in context of what you can control? And how do you even know the progress perhaps that you're making in auto and in home, for example, if the market just isn't there to support it?Sasan K. GoodarziYes, Brad, actually, a great question. And the reason it's such an important question is we are very focused on delivering for our members in the near term, and to your point, leading to this macro environment, but we are undeterred relative to the strategic focus areas for the business. And so let me specifically answer your questions.First of all, let me start with a macro point, which applies to all of Intuit. At Intuit, there are outcomes that we declare that we monitor, but there are also inputs that we focus on. And inputs are key deliverables around product, around go-to-market, around technology investments, and each of our inputs have success measures.And we spend the majority of our time on inputs, because managing inputs and managing where you choose to invest is ultimately the biggest predictor of the outcomes that we want to achieve. So we're very intentional about delivering and managing in the near term for our customers and for you all, and we are undeterred relative to the focus areas that we are focused on in the long term, which are the inputs.With that as sort of uber context in terms of how we run the company, there are several areas that we continue to be focused on, and they're not new, but this is why we believe in the long-term growth of Credit Karma. One is Karma Guarantee. By the way, somebody is typing. So hopefully, you all can hear me.But Karma Guarantee is a big time differentiator. This is where we use our data and our machine learning capabilities to, in essence, provide certainty that a customer is eligible for a credit card or a personal loan, and now 59% of our members are actually able to get a Karma Guarantee offer, which is a huge deal. We're continuing to invest in that area with our financial institutions and getting financial institutions onto our light box.The second is Credit Karma Money. This is huge, right? This is building out the other side of Credit Karma platform, where in essence, we're helping our members manage money, whether it's paying bills, early access to their money, early access of their refund, building their credit, finding ways to save money. And the more members engage with Credit Karma Money, the more their engagement goes up on the platform and the more we can monetize. So that's the second area.And then the third area is what we've talked about in the last several quarters, which is our focus on prime customers. This is why we put Mint and Credit Karma together. We're very underpenetrated with our prime members, and we're building out services. And when we launch them, well, of course, you'll be the first to know to really begin to penetrate and monetize prime customers.And last but not least, this is very important. It's better together with TurboTax. It's all the investments that we are making. Because our goal is we want every Credit Karma member to use TurboTax, and we want every TurboTax customer to put their refund on Credit Karma Money account. So those are the 4 big areas of focus.Brad Alan ZelnickIf I could just ask a quick follow-up, maybe Michelle. Michelle, I appreciate that cash flow is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. It looks like cash taxes had an impact in the first half of the year on free cash flow growth. But -- just in trying to reconcile your margin upside in the quarter with free cash flow performance, are there any items to call out? Any reasons why, for the full year, we shouldn't expect free cash flow growth to be somewhat in line with net income growth?Michelle M. ClatterbuckThanks for the question, Brad. Typically, that is exactly what we would expect. So I would say that this year, we could pretty much expect the same -- that same trend to continue. Yes, we are going to have the lumpiness as we've always talked about, we have that throughout the year and given the way our quarters fall with tax and so forth. But yes, I would expect that you would see that trend continue for the year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities.Bradley Hartwell SillsI wanted to ask a question here on TurboTax Full Service given that this is the first year that you're really making a push here with the offering and then we're getting into the tax season.Curious to get your perspective on whether you think this year might be the year you might see more conversion of existing TurboTax filers to Full Service or is this more of a net new filer coming into the franchise through Full Service, or maybe over time, you shift more towards the latter as the brand gains some traction. Just curious on your expectations there, net new versus existing filers upgrading.Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thanks for the question, Brad. In fact, I'll start with something that we mentioned earlier, but it's really important in the context of your question, and that is our entire campaign strategy and all the investments that we've made in TurboTax Live as a platform has been to bring in prior year assisted customers.And these prior year -- and by the way, our campaign, we'll talk about it in more detail right after tax season. But our campaign is certainly raising heads, and we are seeing more prior year assisted customers come into the franchise because they see it as a great opportunity to digitally get their taxes done from wherever they are and get the expert help that they need.With that said, the way we think about TurboTax Live is it's really one platform. We are -- we don't look at like Full Service as just an attach. We look at -- there are those that will come in and choose to get help along the way, and there are those that will come in and digitally exchange all of the documents, have an appointment and have a discussion with their expert that's been matched with them, and then have us do their taxes for them.And I think we see the type of strength that we would have expected in this area in the -- where we are in the season. With Full Service, you see more of that strength more towards the latter part of the season. But we're pleased with the halo effect that really it creates, because that's what we're really after is to ensure that we communicate and deliver on the promise of if you want to help with your taxes or you want us to do it for you, we're here for you.And it's the combination of that both campaign strategy and platform delivering on that promise. That is what we look for. With that said, the big change this year is 1 session of virtual engagement where we can get your taxes one and done, and we're seeing success there. And I would also just say we're going to see a lot more sort of in March and April, and that's where this full service offering will have the largest impact.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Enders from Citi.Steven Lester EndersOkay. Great. I guess maybe just to follow up on the last TurboTax line of questioning, I guess, so far, what have you seen in terms of kind of the broader adoption of some of those more full service offerings or even TurboTax Live in terms of driving the upside in the quarter? And I guess from a referral standpoint between credit card and TurboTax, I guess what kind of engagement have you seen between the 2 of those that drive that co-branded offering out there?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Very good question. A couple of things that I'll say. First of all, Steve, as we talked about earlier, we have just had a faster forming season this year, which is great because we're able to not only deliver for our customers, but these are folks that really need their money fast and we've seen a really strong uptake of putting their money on a Credit Karma Money account, which is exactly why we've got the integration between those 2 platforms.The second thing I would say, and of course, we'll share more tangible results when season is over, but I'm actually quite excited about what we are seeing this year relative to Credit Karma members, in essence, engaging with TurboTax. We spent a lot of sort of our investments in time this past 5, 6 months to remove friction, to remove blockers, to make it much easier if you're a member to pick the right product and then get your taxes done, whether you want to do it yourself or we'll do it for you. So we're seeing good engagement on that front.And I think just last but not least, we're seeing strength with returning customers that use TurboTax Live coming back this year. And again, it's very early in the season. We're actually excited about all the possibilities of acquiring new customers as we look at the rest of the season, particularly because of our campaign. That's raised a lot of heads that we typically wouldn't have raised.So more to come when season is over. And by the way, we're iterating real-time, making product improvements real-time, launching new features every 7 days, so we're excited about the game that's ahead of us and where we are as we sit today.Steven Lester EndersOkay. Great. That's helpful context there. And just a quick one, if I could get it in here on -- and just on the EPS outlook, I guess, how should we think about what's being put more to work on in terms of the marketing? How much more is getting -- kind of being put to work there versus conservatism, which is inherent in the model at this point, because just seeing really good upside in the past couple of quarters and not necessarily seeing a raise on the EPS side. So I just would love to kind of get your thoughts on that.Sasan K. GoodarziYes, yes, absolutely. It's a very, very good question because if you just do the math, what we've delivered the first half of the year, and you look at where we're going to deliver the second half of the year, it would suggest a significant deceleration. So thank you for asking the question.I would say everything that we talked about across all the businesses stands. We're confident in our guidance and we're confident in what we're seeing in the businesses and where each business sits. I think the reality is, generally, we have a principle, we don't touch our guidance while we're heading into our third quarter.Our third quarter is double the revenue of any other quarter, and so we'd like to get to the third quarter and then talk to you all about what our guidance is moving forward. So really, the way you should think about our guidance is it's derisked.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganCongratulations on a strong quarter. Michelle, we'll definitely miss your smile and energy. Sandeep, look forward to working with you. Back to you, Sasan. You digitized taxes, which were done manually -- well, not like decades ago. Now you're about to digitize payments. I'm curious, as you look at payments, what are the parts of the payments ecosystem that Intuit has not traditionally played in?I know that you've quantified $125 billion of transactions going through your network vis-a-vis $2 trillion or so that's transacted, more broadly speaking, and listen to your comments on payments. It sounds like that is the big kahuna here.Demystify what parts of the payments ecosystem has Intuit not participated in before and which parts would you be able to participate in going forward? You mentioned B2B, accounts payable, receivable, et cetera. That would help frame how much of an opportunity payments is -- because it's a small -- it's [one of your] smallest businesses, but it looks like it's got the biggest growth potential.Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thank you for the question, Kash. And I just have to start by saying we've got a lot of octane in the tank left across all of our Big Bets. I love all of my 5 children, but I'll answer your question around payments. I think there are 3 things. And let me -- 30 seconds of context and I'll specifically answer your question, because we talked about payments and money movement a lot.One huge element of what happens on our platform is small businesses come in, they create an estimate, they invoice and then they need to get paid for that invoice once they do the work. And our penetration in that -- we talk often about we have $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. Our penetration there is still low.And so it's just important to start there and not move off of that because that's a huge growth opportunity. It's a huge area of investment. It's by the way why, in this macro environment where everybody's payments volumes are not accelerating or they're significantly decelerating, we still have 25% total charge volume growth.So that's number one. There's a lot of octane left there, and we are significantly focused. I think the other one that we've traditionally not focused on at all is this entire B2B network, which is digitizing business to business between our small businesses. We now have the capabilities. We launched the business network last quarter to millions of our QuickBooks customers, that is a big opportunity, of course, very low -- no penetration because we didn't have it before, and it's 70% checks. So that's a big one.And then part of that is also just bill pay capabilities, which we've had on our platform through a couple of really strong partners, and now we're building that capability ourselves because we believe that it can deliver a far seamless experience for our customers.And then when you take all of that and go to mid-market, it's even a bigger opportunity, which is why we're seeing the strength in our mid-market growth because of just the size of payments and payroll that takes place.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganSo that is allowing you to participate in these vectors that you couldn't previously access.Sasan K. GoodarziYes, absolutely. Thank you, Kash.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerCongratulations, Michelle and Sandeep. Sasan, first question is going to be in the tax category. It's kind of a multi-parter. This -- the early season, the industry, the IRS is clearly up year-over-year significantly, and that's probably good for you for multiple reasons, like you just mentioned, the Credit Karma Money probably helped.But just would love your thoughts on the industry, why you think it's up so much this year versus last year to start and then it's still way behind in -- through mid-February versus pre-pandemic. So just kind of high-level thoughts on the kind of the cadence of this tax season, to start, and how that may influence the tax season and your view of it overall.Sasan K. GoodarziYes, Scott. I love the question, because this is actually important for everybody to hear since you see the IRS reports on a weekly basis. It's almost -- if I were to tell you all, it's almost hard for you all to pay attention to these reports because so much has changed and will continue to change. So let me start with context.Before COVID, before 2020, things were generally predictable, but things were continuing year in and year out to get pushed out to April. What do I mean by predictable? Generally, you would see a strong first peak, which went through mid-February and it would start end of January, and then you would sort of have very low volume and then you would have a lot of volume come in on the 14th and 15th of April.And what was happening, every year that curve was predictable, but what's happening is every year, more and more people pushed out to do their taxes on the 14th and 15th because there were solutions like ours where they could wait until last minute to do it. So that was pre-COVID. When COVID hit, when everybody sort of was locked up in their homes, when tax season got extended 2 years in a row, and now the fact that folks are actually working virtually, it completely blew up the curve and the habits of customers.And so what we are now seeing this season is initially, we saw a fast forming season similar to what would happen pre-COVID, where a lot of people came in because they needed money. And what we're seeing now is -- what we've been seeing, which is a lot of people are pushing out to complete their taxes sort of last minute.But what's very difficult, I know, for you all to compare, we have a lot of internal data so we can assess what's happening, is that it's hard to compare year-over-year because there's so much that changed in the last several years. And again, what we're seeing this year is now people are at work, but remember, they're still generally working in a hybrid environment. So even days of the week, times of the day when they do their taxes is not comparable to last year.But generally speaking, fast forming, and then a bunch of people are going to do their taxes in the last several days of April before taxes are due is the way you should think about it.Scott Andrew SchneebergerGreat. I appreciate all that color. Next one, a follow-up. Over in Credit Karma Guarantee, you've discussed it a good bid on this call. But when you gave guidance for Credit Karma at the beginning of the year, you were really excited about Guarantee contributing in the back half. I may be a quarter or 2 early here asking this question.You mentioned the 59% penetration of the base. Just curious, how are you tracking this? Is this ahead of where you expected to be at this point, and could it be, in fact, a driver? You mentioned derisked guidance for Credit Karma segment. Is this -- how are you progressing on Guarantee? Is this going to be really meaningful through the back half?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Yes, sure. First of all, let me start with my comments where the guidance for the company is derisked. That includes Credit Karma. So my comments weren't just about Credit Karma, it was really about the whole company.Because if you just do the math, it seems that we are significantly decelerating the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, and that's the point I made, which is principally, we don't touch guidance until we get to our largest quarter, which is this quarter. And so therefore, the way to think about our guidance is that it's derisked. That includes Credit Karma.The second thing is, if you recall, when Michelle and I talked about when we reset the Credit Karma guidance to minus 15% to minus 10%, what we talked about is, one, we feel the new guidance was very prudent. We also really built in some deterioration in the second half of the year, and we didn't count on our innovation having the kind of impact we initially had assumed in our first guidance. And I think that still stands.With that said, I actually feel very good about where we are. I would say we are where we want it to be, because we have very high goals with Karma Guarantee. 59% of our members now having at least one Karma Guarantee offer is really a big deal.So I feel good in terms of the progress we're making on that front, the front of Credit Karma Money with the integration with TurboTax. Those are all -- our input goals in those areas are on track, and it will be fun to watch how they play out the rest of the year, but we're not relying on that to achieve our guidance.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.Brent John ThillSasan, Online Services was slower than QBO accounting at 27%. So I think I just wanted to clarify, was the weakness really just in Mailchimp? Or was there any weakness you saw in payments or payroll?Sasan K. GoodarziYes, Brent, 2 [over] points. The first one is you're always going to see toggling between online accounting growth rate and Online Services growth rate. What you really should pay attention to is the overall growth rate. With that said, to answer your question, we actually saw strength across the board.Mailchimp, our growth is what brought down the Online Services growth to 21%, because it is growing slower, then, of course, it's growing low teens, but it was really driven down by Mailchimp. And Mailchimp is growing low teens, similar to last quarter, but that was really the primary reason. A little bit, a very small amount by payments, now growing at 25%, but really, it's Mailchimp.Brent John ThillFollow-up on Mailchimp. Do you feel that is more internal execution of getting the product right and not wanting to push it out until it's ready? Or is there something competitive going on that you're seeing that's maybe distracting?Sasan K. GoodarziNo. It's really -- we have very clear priorities. We put great leaders in the business. I was actually just in Atlanta about 3 weeks ago, spent more than a day with the entire team, and it's just really execution. And I feel very good about the focus areas, the progress on our execution. It is in our control, which is sort of a great place to be in. It's not macro. It's us.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.Aleksandr J. ZukinCongrats on a great quarter. I guess maybe just 2 quick ones. Sasan, first, if I count the amount of times you said derisk on this call with respect to the guidance, I think that's definitely great to hear.But if you think about like the KPIs that you're seeing in real time around the macro and the SMB, like what would you say -- how would you compare them to the trend line that you saw last quarter? And where do you see them kind of going from a macroeconomic perspective and influencing the demand environment?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Good question, Alex. Let me start with small business. And given that we have 10 million-plus small businesses on our platform and, by the way, with the way they're digitizing, it's probably best to just talk specifically about the data that we are seeing.If you go back to last quarter, what I had mentioned is small businesses generally still have strong cash reserves. They're using some of those cash reserves to continue to invest in their business, and they're still hiring. They're still having a little bit of a hard time hiring, but they are still hiring. They couldn't find talent.But then there are sectors like financial services, real estate, auto, that were down nearly 15% in revenue year-over-year. If I forwarded to the data that we're seeing now this quarter, 2 things. One, they're continuing to hire, and they're actually finding it easier to hire. And those same industries that I just mentioned, real estate, financial services and auto have actually kicked off in performance.Our performance is better. Like, for instance, I think real estate and financial services are -- they were down like 15% plus, and now they're down less than 10% as an example. And auto, believe it or not, was down minus 2% versus the minus sort of 10% to 15% it was down. So we're actually seeing an uptick and improved performance in our base in those areas that were actually hit the hardest.So that's sort of the macro environment that I would say. And I would actually reiterate what Michelle and I talked about earlier, which is our focus and innovation on payments is working, because although consumer spending has moderated a bit, our total charge volume is growing 25%, which is quite healthy and significant. So that's what we're seeing on the small business side.On the Consumer side, 2 things I would say. And remember, we have nearly 100 million consumers on our platform, so this is really indicative of the world outside of our platform. Since March of last year, credit scores are down about 13 points, and credit card balances are up a little bit over 20%.Those that are hit the hardest are those that are in the credit band of 600 to 660, where their average balance on their credit card is like $9,000. So that's the a little bit of the state of the world on the consumer side. Hopefully that answers your question, Alex.Aleksandr J. ZukinYes. That was actually extremely detailed. And then I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you a question about generative AI and how or if at all Intuit has plans to monetize or integrate that technology. It does seem like having your own personal financial digital assistant or a live plus functionality would kind of seem logical, but would be really interested to kind of get a sense of how you're all thinking about it.Sasan K. GoodarziAlex, I'm glad you got it in. I'm surprised it took until the top of the hour for somebody to ask, so thank you for asking. It's actually a really important question. And I want to take you all back to AI is core to our strategy. And now that everybody is talking about AI, I'm actually delighted, because hopefully, it will expose to all of you why 4 years ago, when we refreshed our strategy, it was about being an AI-driven expert platform.And the investments that we've made in data and in AI is really what's fueled a lot of our innovation across the company. And as you heard us talk about at Investor Day, it's why we put Marianna in front of you all. We're just at the beginning of the curve as to what's possible. So first and foremost, the investments around data and AI is what's fueling our success. And we've been looking at generative AI.In fact, there are multiple areas across our platform where we've launched some of the capabilities of generative AI because it's all about reducing work and finding ways to put more money in your pocket with confidence, and it actually helps our experts.The key areas that we are focused on working with a couple of companies in this area is accuracy. And it will become more accurate over time, but we deal with people's money, and that matters in terms of the advice that we give. For us, this is all an accelerant, which, by the way, we've been working on for many, many, many months before this became sort of the buzz. But AI is core to our strategy, so we're delighted with the possibilities of the future.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Well, listen, thank you, everybody, for your time. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Once again, I want to thank Michelle for 20 years at Intuit. She'll be back with us, by the way. She's with us through August. And delighted with Sandeep joining us as our new CFO in August. But with that said, we'll talk to you at next earnings. Until then, be safe, be good. Talk soon. Bye, everybody.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.]"

For the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $62 million and $109 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes.Our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 were approximately 26% and 20%, respectively. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate for both periods was approximately 24%. The difference from the federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the tax benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit.We recorded a $70 million tax benefit on pretax income of $30 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. We recorded a $60 million tax benefit on pretax income of $268 million for the six months ended January 31, 2022. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to share-based compensation tax benefits mentioned above, our effective tax rate for both periods was approximately 25%. The difference from the federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the tax benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit.In the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.TABLE B1INTUIT INC.RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTO MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(In millions, except per share amounts)(Unaudited)Fiscal 2023Q1Q2Q3Q4Year to DateGAAP operating income (loss)$76$270$—$—$346Amortization of acquired technology4141——82Amortization of other acquired intangible assets121121——242Professional fees for business combinations21——3Share-based compensation expense422423——845Non-GAAP operating income (loss)$662$856$—$—$1,518GAAP net income (loss)$40$168$—$—$208Amortization of acquired technology4141——82Amortization of other acquired intangible assets121121——242Professional fees for business combinations21——3Share-based compensation expense422423——845Net (gain) loss on debt securities and other investments—2——2Income tax effects and adjustments [A](156)(136)——(292)Non-GAAP net income (loss)$470$620$—$—$1,090GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share$0.14$0.60$—$—$0.73Amortization of acquired technology0.140.14——0.28Amortization of other acquired intangible assets0.430.43——0.86Professional fees for business combinations0.01———0.01Share-based compensation expense1.491.50——2.99Net (gain) loss on debt securities and other investments—0.01——0.01Income tax effects and adjustments [A](0.55)(0.48)——(1.03)Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share$1.66$2.20$—$—$3.85Shares used in GAAP diluted per share calculation284282——283Shares used in non-GAAP diluted per share calculation284282——283[A]As discussed in ""About Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Income Tax Effects and Adjustments"" following Table E, our long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items.

The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26.1%.Our projection of adjusted EPS was 86 cents.GAAP EPS for the quarter was 74 cents, reflecting a plunge of 58.7% year over year.Full-year adjusted EPS was $6.60, down 28.6% from the end of 2021. Our projection of full-year adjusted EPS was $6.27.Revenues in DetailRevenues of $2.92 billion in the fourth quarter were down by 0.9% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.The fourth-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $2.93 billion.Management noted that the top line was aided by non-recurring favorable adjustments in the third quarter. However, the quarterly revenues were negatively impacted by increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues, favorable changes in government rates driven by the administration of influenza vaccines, favorable changes in the commercial mix and the continued migration to Medicare Advantage plans.Full-year revenues were $11.61 billion, reflecting a 0.1% dip from the comparable 2021 period. Our projection of full-year revenues was $11.63 billion.Segment DetailsThe company’s dialysis patient service revenues were $2.80 billion, down by 1.4% year over year. Other revenues were $113.3 million, up 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.This figure compares to our dialysis patient service revenues and Other revenues fourth-quarter projection of $2.83 billion and $106.2 million, respectively.Per management, the total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter were 7,239,660 or 91,641 per day, on average. This represents a per-day decrease of 1.3% on a sequential basis.As of Dec 31, 2022, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 245,000 patients at 3,074 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,724 were U.S. centers while 350 were located across 11 other countries.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company opened a total of six new dialysis centers and closed 58 dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired three dialysis centers, opened three dialysis centers and closed eight dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesDaVita Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | DaVita Inc. QuoteMargin DetailsIn the quarter under review, DaVita’s gross profit fell 6.3% to $828.2 million. Gross margin contracted 163 basis points (bps) to 28.4%.We had projected a 25.5% of gross margin for the fourth quarter.General &amp; administrative expenses climbed 17.7% to $379.7 million.Adjusted operating profit totaled $448.5 million, reflecting a 20.1% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter contracted 368 bps to 15.4%.Financial PositionDaVita exited the full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $321.8 million compared with $484.2 million at the end of 2021.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $6.46.Our TakeDaVita ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with lower-than-expected revenues. The dismal overall top-line and bottom-line results are disappointing. A fall in the company’s dialysis patient service revenues and total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter is concerning. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well for the company. The company faced negative volume trends and continued labor pressure during the reported quarter, which is further concerning.However, DaVita’s better-than-expected earnings are encouraging. The uptick in the company’s Other revenues during the period is impressive. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and the opening of others within the United States and overseas is also encouraging.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.0%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool Whirlpool's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Whirlpool is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business. This gives us some comfort about the level of the dividend payments.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 16%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWhirlpool Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.00 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $7.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Company Could Face Some Challenges Growing The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Whirlpool has been growing its earnings per share at 18% a year over the past five years. Unprofitable companies aren't normally our pick for a dividend stock, but we like the growth that we have been seeing. As long as the company becomes profitable soon, it is on a trajectory that could see it being a solid dividend payer.Our Thoughts On Whirlpool's DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Whirlpool's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for Whirlpool you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

395,0139d86b-563d-3523-bd25-5fcdc14f2fb5,IR,2023-02-24,Results: Ingersoll Rand Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-ingersoll-rand-inc-exceeded-103128472.html,1677234688,STORY,"['TT', 'IR']","[As you might know, Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) recently reported its yearly numbers. Ingersoll Rand reported US$5.9b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.47 beat expectations, being 8.3% higher than what the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Ingersoll Rand after the latest results. Check out our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Ingersoll Rand's twelve analysts is for revenues of US$6.39b in 2023, which would reflect a modest 8.0% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 29% to US$1.88. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$6.29b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.04 in 2023. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.The consensus price target held steady at US$63.23, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Ingersoll Rand, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$82.00 and the most bearish at US$53.00 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.Story continuesAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that Ingersoll Rand's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.0% annualised growth rate until the end of 2023 being well below the historical 21% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.9% annually. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Ingersoll Rand is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Ingersoll Rand. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for Ingersoll Rand going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.You can also see whether Ingersoll Rand is carrying too much debt, and whether its balance sheet is healthy, for free  on our platform here.Have feedback on this article?

At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.Story continuesVicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to start by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver a record year in 2022. We finished the year on a high note, with strong fourth quarter and full year results despite ongoing inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainty. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose, while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitment. And our performance this year clearly reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. Starting with Slide 3, in 2022, we demonstrated again how we continue to over deliver on our Investor Day commitments. We also made tremendous progress against our sustainability goals, but I'm very proud that Ingersoll Rand was named to the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index.As we look to 2023, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and global supply chain uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind, we will remain agile and focused on what we can control. IRX is our differentiator to fuel our performance and continue to execute on our commitments. Turning to Slide 4. During our last Investor Day, we highlighted how we delivered compounding results through our economic growth engine. We remain committed to our strategy and its success is evident, given the results outlined at the bottom of this page. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global megatrends, (ph), sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025.And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2022, delivering 16% year-over-year organic revenue growth. In 2022, we delivered 4% of in-year growth from M&amp;A or 5% on an annual basis. The combined organic growth and inorganic growth of 22% (ph) a low-double digit growth commitment. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we reaffirm our commitment to deliver total average growth of low-double digits through 2025. Our strong organic growth levers, aftermarket demand generation, as well as our i2V initiatives will enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement per year on average. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 300 IMPACT Daily Management, or IDMs, across our company each week, our high-performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution.This continues to support our goal of being a premier company that consistently compounds earnings on average by double digit each year. In 2022, we continued to achieve that goal with adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Moving to Slide 5. In 2022, we saw strong organic order and revenue growth of 11% and 16%, respectively. Aftermarket continues to be a strategic focus and we delivered growth of 17% excluding FX. Our 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was driven in part by improvement in our gross margin due to pricing, aftermarket revenue growth and i2V actions. As we continue to align our business to the mega growth trends, we formalized our IR-Digital team to accelerate how we create new revenue streams. It's important to note that this is an incremental investment we made in addition to the teams that reside at the business level.With 19% of our total revenues coming from IIoT-ready products, we have already exceeded our 2023 Investor Day targets. On the right side of the page is a great example of our ability to deliver organic growth by focusing on the sustainability and efficiency megatrend. We were selected to be a critical technology provider for what will be the largest carbon capture and storage project in the world when it comes online in 2024. With a capacity to permanently capture and store 12 million tons of carbon dioxide gas every year. This one project will deliver more than $14 million of value for Ingersoll Rand between 2023 and 2024. On Slide 6, M&amp;A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation trends. We invested over $800 million in 12 acquisitions in 2022, including the SPX Flow transaction with the annualized revenue from these acquisitions being approximately $300 million.These acquisitions have added both market-leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. Our M&amp;A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the R&amp;D. And more importantly, we currently have 11 transactions under LOI. We expect an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Finally, we started the year well with regards to executing on our inorganic strategy with the recently completed acquisition of Paragon Tank Truck, a leading provider of solutions used for loading and unloading dry bulk and liquid tanks in demanding industrial environments as well as food and beverage. Moving to Slide 7, we have some exciting news to share.We achieved placement on the DJSI World and DJSI North America Indices. Our score of 81 on the S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment puts us at the Number One in North America and Number Four in the world within our industry, which means that we are in the top decile of global companies. This is a perfect example of how we leverage IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to go from being unranked to now in the top 10% of all companies (ph) by S&amp;P Global. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2022 financial performance.Vik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 8, we finished the year with strong performance in Q4 through a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by IRX despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 2% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up 30% year-over-year, equate over $2 billion of backlog. This provides a healthy backlog to execute on as we enter 2023 and gives us conviction in delivering our 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA $420 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.9%, a 180 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 110 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3.For the quarter, adjusted EPS was up 6% versus prior year. This is despite some meaningful headwinds that I will explain shortly. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.7 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $100 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve year-over-year and sequentially. At 0.8 turns, we're 0.3 turns better than the prior year and 0.2 turns better than prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q4 orders grew 5% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year, with the ITS segment margin increasing 170 basis points, while the PST segment margin improving 330 basis points.It's important to note that both segments are price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $33 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 6% to $0.72 per share. This 6% growth includes significant headwinds associated with FX as well as favorability in the prior year tax rate due to one-time benefits that were not expected to recur and an ongoing headwind associated with interest expense. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly below 22%. On Slide 10, total company full year orders grew 16% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis.Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 100 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 70 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&amp;A completed largely in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points. As you recall, most of the decline in adjusted EBITDA margins throughout the year was due to the Seepex acquisition. I am pleased to report that Seepex is another amazing story where we acquired a business at mid-teens EBITDA margin and the exit rate in Q4, just five quarters after the acquisition, is in the mid-20%s. We are well underway to getting Seepex to our PST fleet average EBITDA margin. We continue to see sequential increases in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins and now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically, at approximately 30%.Both segments, finished the year price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which was a major driver of the company's overall triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Corporate costs finished the year at $127 million, down $6 million from prior year, largely due to adjustments in management incentive costs. And lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 13% to $2.36 per share. It is important to note that the adjusted EPS growth includes significant one-time headwinds associated with FX, prior year tax rate and interest expense. If you exclude the impact of these headwinds, our adjusted EPS growth would have been over 20%. Moving to the next slide, in 2022, we returned $294 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, including CapEx, which totaled $34 million.And total company liquidity now stands at $2.7 billion, based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It's important to note that these figures include approximately $525 million of cash, which has subsequently been deployed for the SPX Flow's Air Treatment business acquisition on January 3, 2023. Leverage for the quarter was 0.8 turns, which was 0.3 turn improvement year-over-year. And cash flow outflows for the quarter included a $184 million deployed to M&amp;A, $8 million to our dividend payment and $3 million for share repurchases. M&amp;A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&amp;A to be our primary usage of cash. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.15 fastest growing industries in the worldChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 22%, with volume growth outpacing growth from pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 170 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 4%. Note that on a two-year stack the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 20%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of OpEx, which year-over-year was (ph) percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue.Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low-single digits and we continue to see oil free products orders outpacing oil lubricated products. Orders were down mid-single digits in the Americas, driven by a large order push from Q4 to the first quarter of 2023. EMEIA demand continues to be above market, with orders up mid-single digits. The Asia-Pacific team continues to deliver great performance with orders growth in the mid-teens, which is impressive when you think about that our team in China delivered double digit growth even throughout the COVID-related closures and disruptions. In vacuum and blowers, orders were up low-20%s level. And the power tool and lifting global orders grew mid-single digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our footprint expansion in India, which is another organic investment initiatives we're drive.We have seen significant growth in India and we continue to drive opportunities for in region for region manufacturing, which is driving the need for increase in our footprint. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 9% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $93 million, which was up 20% year-over-year, with incremental margins of over 80%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.1%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see sequential improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins driven by price/cost improvement and synergy delivery on our recently completed M&amp;A, such as Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year as Q4 comps were challenged due to headwinds from a single large hydrogen order intake in Q4 of 2021, which will deliver a network of refueling stations in New Zealand.Adjusting for these hydrogen order, normalized organic orders were up slightly. And on a two-year stack, organic orders are up double digits. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our EVO Electric Diaphragm Pump. This recently launched product is the only-electric triple-chamber diaphragm pump in the market. The EVO Series pump is utilizing high-growth end markets, such as electric vehicle batteries, specialty chemical manufacturing and food and beverage applications. This product offers significant energy savings, leading to faster payback times for our customers. And this is yet another perfect example of sustainability as a growth driver and our focus on high-growth sustainable end markets, enabling us to deliver double-digit earnings growth.As we move to Slide 14, we're introducing our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 7% to 9%, with the first half growth of 9% to 11% and the second half growth of 4% to 6%. We anticipate organic orders growth of 3% to 5%, where price is approximately 70% and volume 30%. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a headwind for the year, of which the impact will primarily be realized in the first half of the year. M&amp;A is projected at $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&amp;A transactions in 2022 as well as the acquisition of SPX Flow Air Treatment and Paragon Tank Truck. Corporate costs are planned at $140 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The year-over-year increase is largely driven by investment in IIoT and demand generation.Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.57 billion and $1.63 billion. At the bottom of the table, we're introducing adjusted EPS guidance. While we have not historically guided EPS, we will now include (ph) metrics moving forward. Adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $2.48 and $2.58. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low-20%s, interest expense to be approximately $165 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue. The right hand side of the page includes a 2023 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with operational activity and the headwinds associated with interest expenses, FX and changes in the adjusted tax rate. Based on the above guidance, adjusted EPS growth attributed to operational performance, is approximately 13% to 17%, offset by approximately 8% in headwinds from interest expense, FX and the adjusted tax rate.As we sit here in mid-February and to provide some Q1 commentary, it is worth noting that we have seen organic orders continue to be positive on a quarter-to-date basis through the first week of February, which is consistent with our expectations. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We finished 2022 with strong Q4 results. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, while remaining agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent finish to the year. We delivered strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meet our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the strong use of IRX.Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you have as owners of the company. Our balance sheet is strong. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation policy and strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&amp;A.See also George Soros' Top 15 Holdings and 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
397,9920d6ab-8279-3cbc-a987-cbe059c316b8,SRE,2023-02-24,7 Stocks That Can Survive a Bumpy Ride to Low Inflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-survive-bumpy-ride-191503077.html,1676920503,STORY,"['DG', 'ALL-PG', 'ADM', 'FIVE', 'SRE', 'PSX', 'WTRG']","[Throughout 2022, investors quickly recognized that success for stocks to buy centered on entities that could ride out rising prices. Now, investors may need to strategize for the opposite scenario: the Federal Reserve continuing to hike benchmark interest rates to get inflation under control. Unfortunately, that might mean struggling through deflationary forces to get to low inflation.It just comes down to a math problem. In order for high inflation to come down to low inflation, some deceleration must occur, which would be relatively deflationary. By logical deduction, investors should consider stocks to buy that may perform decently well during cycles of declining prices.While no one knows what the Fed might do, the latest Consumer Price Index report came in slightly higher than expected. In addition, China’s economic reopening would translate to greater commercial activity, which is positive. However, it also means greater resource consumption, leading to higher prices. Therefore, it’s important to consider stocks to buy that may ride out the Fed’s hawkish strategy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$210.47DGDollar General$227.82ALLAllstate$135.05WTRGEssential Utilities$46.15SRESempra Energy$158.49ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.59PSXPhillips 66$99.54Stocks to Buy: Five Below (FIVE)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWith the Fed signaling that its top priority centers on controlling inflation, investors may want to target relatively upscale discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). Unlike literal dollar stores, Five Below carries prices up to its namesake price. As well, it features a select range of products that can go up to $25. Therefore, the company provides several compelling products that should appeal to a broader consumer base.Fundamentally, Five Below may buffet the storm of the higher rates necessary to bring inflation down to a low level. Basically, the classical definition of inflation is a circumstance where more dollars chase after fewer goods. With deflation, fewer dollars chase after more goods. But to get deflation, a central bank must usually crimp demand, which would hurt the labor market. Unfortunately, this dynamic suggests that consumers must make do with less. However, such a framework would likely benefit Five Below. Therefore, FIVE stands among the stocks to buy.Story continuesStocks to Buy: Dollar General (DG)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comUnder a similar philosophy to Five Below above, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) presents an effective name among stocks to buy. True, Dollar General might typically be an idea to mitigate the impact of ever-rising prices. However, the dollar store can also perform relatively well under deflationary forces. Again, such a condition implies a negative impact on the workforce, which means discount retailers will gain tremendous relevance.What I appreciate about DG as one of the stocks to buy ahead of the Fed’s potentially hawkish measures is its objective discount. According to Gurufocus.com’s DCF analysis, DG represents a modestly undervalued investment. Specifically, the investment resource calculates the fair value at $273.35. However, the market priced DG at $227.82 at the time of writing.Also, Dollar General benefits from excellent operational strengths. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.6%, outpacing 86.57% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 6.49%, beating out more than 87% of its peers. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $264.93, implying over 16% upside potential.Stocks to Buy: Allstate (ALL)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For the Fed’s efforts to contain inflation, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is an excellent candidate for stocks to buy. And that’s because whether we’re talking inflation, deflation, or some other kind of “flation” – including the dreaded stagflation – Allstate delivers. It has to be because the company benefits richly from a hostage audience.  For instance, almost every state in the Union requires auto drivers to carry at least liability insurance. Further, those rare jurisdictions that allow people to drive sans insurance must demonstrate proof of financial wherewithal. Basically, it’s just better to carry insurance, primarily because of the fear of the unknown.Plus, when the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, insurance pays. I mean, it can really save your hind end, even with a hefty deductible. In exchange for hundreds of dollars, you’ll spare yourself the pain of tens of thousands of dollars.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $142.31, implying over 5% growth. With a dividend yield of 2.52%, Allstate may be boring but it gets the job done.Essential Utilities (WTRG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAgainst a longer-term framework, arguably most people understand (and perhaps appreciate) what the Fed’s doing. If inflation continues to rise out of control, the economy may suffer substantial damage. However, getting to the point of low inflation is a major pain. To mitigate the possible incoming volatility, investors should consider Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) as one of the stocks to buy.A drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and service provider, Essential Utilities carries the underlying sector’s major advantage: a natural monopoly. Due to the extraordinarily high barrier to entry, few entities can compete with Essential. Cynically, this dynamic bodes very well for WTRG stock.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company enjoys excellent operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.7% of its peers. Also, its net margin pings at 22%, above nearly 88% of the sector. Lastly, Wall Street analysts love WTRG, pegging it a unanimous strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying over 15% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAs with Essential Utilities above, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) ranks among the stocks to buy because of its natural monopoly advantage. Despite Sempra’s customers complaining up a storm about its business practices over the years, no one can replace it. Nor can anyone provide an alternative: the barrier to entry simply rates well above most enterprises’ pay grade, particularly in California.Speaking of the Golden State, Sempra’s other advantages center on its geographic location. Covering much of Southern California, Sempra benefits from an economic powerhouse of the biggest engine of the U.S. While people complain about California and its high prices, the state continues to attract top-tier talent. Frankly, it’s too important of a region to ignore. Plus, when you’re dealing with such a lucrative market, the customers’ ability to pay becomes less of an issue. That’s something to keep in mind for stocks to buy as the Fed targets low inflation.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target of $172.50 implies nearly 9% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is one of the stocks to buy as the Fed attempts to spark low inflation. Because of the core necessity of the underlying sector, ADM can rise irrespective of fluctuating monetary cycles. After all, humans must eat, irrespective of what’s going on with the interest rate environment.Notably, ADM gained over 6% in the trailing year. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped more than 5% during the same period. Part of its resilience stems from its passive income. Presently, the company carries a forward yield of 2.21%. As well, the enterprise commands 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. That’s a status management won’t give up on without a major fight. Convincingly, Wall Street analysts peg ADM as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $104.20, implying upside potential of nearly 28%. Thus, ADM ranks among the top stocks to buy for the rough journey to low inflation.Phillips 66 (PSX)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the sector’s value chain. This involves refining and marketing. Fundamentally, Phillips 66 benefits from purchases of necessity. While the electric vehicle revolution may be occurring right now, the vast majority of people drive combustion-powered cars. Thus, PSX will stay relevant for quite some time.In the trailing year, Phillips 66 shares gained over 18% of equity value. Since the January opener, though, they slipped about 1.5%. However, this might be a buying opportunity as provides a compelling case from a passive income perspective. Right now, its forward yield stands at 4.22%. Moreover, it’s a stable yield thanks to its low payout ratio of 32.66%.Financially, PSX trades at a trailing multiple of 4.34. As a discount to earnings, the oil firm ranks better than 71.26% of the competition. In addition, it trades at 0.28 times sales. For this metric, Phillips 66 ranks better than 81.39% of sector peers. Thus, it’s a compelling example of stocks to buy for the low-inflation journey.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Shares have added about 3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GE due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.General Electric Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues MissGeneral Electric reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding 42 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.24 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.

Adjusted earnings are predicted in the band of $1.60-$2.00 per share. The mid-point of the guided range — $1.80 — is short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.61. GE expects a free cash flow of approximately $3.4-$4.2 billion for the ongoing year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -79.08% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, GE has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

402,16cd2729-39a7-3233-9850-584d020357d2,GE,2023-02-24,7 Stocks to Watch as Electric Vehicle Adoption Takes Off,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-watch-electric-vehicle-155350901.html,1676908430,STORY,"['GE', 'BB', 'FLRAP', 'XPEV']","[Electric vehicle adoption is taking off and is poised to keep climbing tremendously in the coming years. First of all, New York, California, and the EU have all banned the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035, and the governments of those jurisdictions will all take steps to boost the sale of EVs in the coming years. Secondly, the Biden administration is moving to deploy EV chargers around the country, eliminating the “range anxiety” issues that have inhibited the sale of EVs. And finally, given the lower, much more stable cost of electricity compared to oil and the new 30% tax credit for many EV purchases, EVs, on the whole, have much cheaper total ownership costs than their gasoline-powered counterparts. Given these points, it makes sense to find stocks to watch to prepare to benefit from the EV boom.Of course, EV makers won’t be the only companies to get a big lift from EV proliferation. Among the other types of companies that should get a considerable boost from the trend are companies that produce and facilitate electricity, along with those that secure EVs from hackers and companies that can help build factories that manufacture battery components and process lithium.Here are seven stocks to watch as EV adoption takes off.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceBBBlackBerry$4.15STEMStem$8.30FLRFluor$36.65GEGeneral Electric$83.04SOLOElectrameccanica$0.93XPEVXPeng$9.53OXUSOxus Acquisition Corp.$10.39BlackBerry (BB)A BlackBerry (BB) sign out front of a corporate office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: ShutterstockI recently read that EVs include many more high-tech innovations than gasoline-powered vehicles because, once automakers redesign their vehicles’ propulsion systems, it becomes easier for them to upgrade all of their other systems simultaneously.Of course, these days, high-tech devices tend to be connected to the internet, and automobiles are no different. Moreover, just like all connected devices, connected vehicles can be hacked.Story continuesBlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has taken advantage of that reality by successfully selling its highly secure operating system, QNX, to most EV makers. In fact, “24 of the top 25 electric vehicle makers use QNX,” BB has reported.In BlackBerry’s fiscal third quarter, the revenue of its Internet of Things unit, which QNX dominates, climbed to $51 million from $43 million during the same period a year earlier, while the unit’s gross margin increased to $41 million from $35 million.But BlackBerry is moving beyond QNX, as it has created, in partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), IVY, a software platform that will, using artificial intelligence, collect data about EVs and allow developers and automakers to sell subscriptions to drivers easily. IVY, unlike QNX, generates one-time fees for BB and creates recurring revenue streams for the company. BlackBerry recently reported that there has been “a lot of demand” for IVY, which is entering proof-of-concept trials.And, in a sign that IVY could become huge in China, one of the country’s largest automakers, Dongfeng (OTCMKTS:DNFGF), recently committed to utilizing the platform.Stem (STEM)Purple and blue graphic of brain over top of data center, smartphone, laptop and various other tech, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocksSource: shutterstock.com/Nadya CAs I explained in an August 2021 column, “Stem’s AI platform, Athena, increases the efficiency of energy storage systems that work in tandem with renewable energy ‘by automatically switching between battery power, onsite generation and grid power.'”As the utilization of EVs increase, companies’ electricity costs will jump. Consequently, finding ways to cut electricity costs will become much more important to companies, and more of them will be willing to utilize Stem’s (NYSE:STEM) AI.In  fact, that trend is already materializing, as Stem’s top line is soaring. Last quarter, for example, its revenue soared an incredible 195% year-over-year to $156 million. For all of 2022, its sales jumped 186% to $363 million. And its Q4 EBITDA loss, excluding certain items, came in at a manageable $10 million, better than the $12 million adjusted EBITDA loss it generated in Q4 of 2021.Additionally,  the company’s recently announced collaboration with ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), America’s leading EV charger operator,  should be a game changer for Stem’s financial results and STEM stock.Fluor (FLR)A Fluor (FLR) sign at the main entrance the Fluor headquarters in Irving, Texas.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in the introduction to this column, electric vehicles will require much more electricity and batteries. One way to play those trends is with Fluor (NYSE:FLR), which provides engineering, procurement, and construction services. In other words, Fluor designs and builds facilities for other companies.With renewable energy not yet ready to handle all of the world’s electricity needs amid the proliferation of EVs, the demand for natural gas will likely jump, benefiting Fluor’s significant liquid natural gas business. And the company also develops facilities to process polysilicon, an essential raw material for solar panels and battery chemicals.Both raw materials will be critical as the world looks to step up its electricity generation. Also noteworthy is that in November, Fluor completed a “Lithium Conversion project” for lithium miner Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) in China. With lithium production jumping, Fluor is well-positioned to obtain many more such projects.In the third quarter of last year, Fluor’s backlog soared 30% versus the previous quarter. Thus, it is among the top EV stocks to buy.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comLike Fluor and Stem, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is well-positioned to benefit from the significant increase in electricity production needed to support EVs. That makes it among the top EV stocks to buy in my book.That’s because GE sells gas turbines that are integral to natural gas electric plants and wind turbines that generate electricity. Moreover, GE’s Grid unit sells products that enable electrical grids to be upgraded and modernized.In positive signs for GE’s Power and wind businesses, Power’s orders soared 29%, excluding acquisitions and divestments, last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. In contrast, the orders of the company’s Renewable unit, excluding acquisitions and divestments, climbed 7% year-over-year. Power generated a free cash flow of $1.9 billion in Q4. Also noteworthy is that the conglomerate’s grid unit achieved profitability in Q4.GE reported, “Long-term, Renewable Energy is firmly positioned to lead the energy transition, building on advanced technologies and external growth catalysts, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, while taking action to improve performance.”GE’s Power, Renewables, and Grid business will be spun off from GE into a single company called Vernova in 2024. So investors who buy GE stock in 2023 will get shares of a pure-play electricity player next year.Electrameccanica (SOLO)The Solo vehicle from Electra Meccanica Vehicles (SOLO) drives through VancouverSource: Luis War / Shutterstock.comElectrameccanica (NASDAQ:SOLO) manufactures and markets a three-wheeled electric vehicle that carries one person. Called the Solo, the regular version of the EV costs just $15,500 and has a range of 100 miles and a maximum speed of 80 miles per hour. A larger version of the EV, called the Solo Cargo, costs $24,500.Intriguingly, in September 2022, a Pizza Hut franchisee that owns 230 restaurants in Southern California began a 13-week trial of 14 Solo Cargo EVs. The franchisee’s interest in trying out the Solo indicates that the low-cost EV, which requires very little power, could appeal to restaurant owners.Also noteworthy is that, for those who commute to cities, the Solo is very easy to park and maneuver in crowded urban areas.In an October 2022 review of the EV, CleanTechnica reported that the EV is “easy to maneuver around the city streets here in San Diego and…it fits well into this type of environment.” It added, “The Solo interior has all of the basic essentials you need for a vehicle.”Finally, Electrameccanica provided ten Solos for use by the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, which facilitated 2023’s Big Game. The move likely generated a great deal of publicity and buzz for Solo, making it among the top EV stocks.EV Stocks: XPeng (XPEV)Silver door of Xpeng (XPEV) EV with company logoSource: shutterstock.com/helloabcChinese automaker XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) expects to deliver 200,000 EVs this year, up from 120,000 last year. Among the trends that should help the company meet its goal are China’s reopening, its expansion in Europe, and its new G9 SUV, which has received very favorable reviews.Moreover, the G9’s autonomous-driving systems are so good and so complete that they became “the first mass-produced vehicle to” be tested “as an autonomous vehicle” in China. So, in addition to boosting the G9’s sales, the EV’s advanced autonomy software could enable it to become a lucrative robotaxi for XPeng down the road. Another intriguing project that XPEV is working on is a flying car.Changing hands for just 1.5 times analysts’ average 2023 revenue estimate for XPeng, XPEV stock is definitely one of the top EV stocks.Oxus Acquisition Corp. (OXUS)A vector illustration of a battery with neon lines swirling it; forever batterySource: MarySan / ShutterstockOxus (NASDAQ:OXUS), a SPAC, was launched by Kenes Rakishev, an investor from Kazakhstan, who was one of the first financial backers of Israeli battery maker StoreDot.Subsequently, the Israeli company has received funds from multiple big-name companies, including BP (NYSE:BP) and Daimler (OTCMKTS:DDAIF), and StoreDot is partnering with a major Chinese EV battery maker, EVE Energy.Moreover, StoreDot’s batteries “are now being used and tested by over 15 global automotive brands,” Inside EVs reported last month., And very impressively, the Israeli firm expects to “mass produce battery cells capable of 100 miles of range in five minutes of charge by 2024, 100 miles in three minutes by 2028 and 100 miles in two minutes by 2032.”Given Rakishev’s prior connection with StoreDot and the fact that StoreDot has reportedly considered merging with a SPAC previously, there have been rumors that Oxus would merge with StoreDot.Alternatively, Oxus has been rumored to be looking to merge with a nickel and cobalt miner in which Rakishev has invested. Since nickel and cobalt are both major components of EV batteries, those who buy OXUS stock now could potentially benefit from booming demand for those minerals.Oxus may name its merger partner soon, triggering a huge rally by OXUs stock. That’s because, on Feb. 6, the company disclosed in an SEC filing that it would seek the approval of its shareholders at a Feb. 28 meeting to delay the deadline by which it must merge with a company until Dec. 8, 2023. The previous deadline was Mar. 8, 2023.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of STEM, BB, XPEV,GE,OXUS, and SOLO.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

I'll now turn the call over to Cindy.Story continuesCindy J. MillerThank you, Andrew, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to start off today's discussion by thanking all of our team members and especially, our frontline workers for supporting our customers and protecting what matters. I'm pleased to share that our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. Our quarterly results included organic revenue growth of 5.7%, free cash flow generation of $130.9 million, expanded margins, reduced debt, improved leverage and continued portfolio optimization.As a company, we continue to focus on executing on our 5 key business priorities, and I'll start with quality of revenue. Organic revenues increased 5.7%, led by Secure Information Destruction, which grew 12.2%. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services grew 2.8% and in North America, organic revenues grew 7.6%, with Secure Information Destruction increasing 13.2% and Regulated Waste and Compliance Services increasing 4.9%. These results include the benefits from our service cost recovery fee, and the enhanced recycling revenue surcharge that started in the first part of 2022. These 2 pricing levers contributed approximately $10 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and $24 million of incremental revenue for the year.Since 2019, we have been working on transforming the commercial function, to drive greater consistency and accountability throughout the sales process. The foundation of our commercial excellence model includes the following: one, harmonizing over 120 global sales commission plans to a handful of sales commission plan types that standardize performance expectations and incentivize revenue growth and margin expansion while simplifying overall performance and planned administration; two, improving governance over contractual language to include competitive standard terms and conditions; three, redefining our value proposition to drive competitive differentiation and providing extensive training on value selling with a disciplined organic growth mindset; four, implementing a new deal review committee to ensure consistent, disciplined, value-based pricing, contracting, sales practices and governance; five, launching a pipeline management process and tools to better forecast and manage opportunities and performance throughout the sales cycle, resulting in pipeline growth, improved conversion rates and higher quality sales; and six, creating a data infrastructure as part of our ongoing ERP deployment, that allows us to draw greater insights into sales opportunities and service performance across the customer life cycle.With these foundational elements now in place, we are advancing to the next phase of our commercial evolution to support our organic compounded annual revenue growth rate of 3% to 5%, which focuses on 3 key areas: expanding service penetration, improving customer implementation velocity and deepening customer partnerships by developing enhanced customer solutions. The first area is expanding service penetration. Drawing from our newly created data infrastructure, we will leverage insights to win, grow and retain customers through cross-sell and upsell initiatives and targeted sales offerings, which we expect will increase the value, we provide to our customers.The second area is improving customer implementation velocity. This is focused on accelerating speed to revenue by decreasing the amount of time it takes from closing a deal, to initially servicing customers. The third area is deepening customer partnerships by developing enhanced customer solutions. We plan to continue to commercialize innovative solutions and products, we expect will drive additional revenue opportunities. As we create safer and more sustainable working environments for our customers, their employees and the communities in which we operate.I'll now move on to our next key business priority, operational efficiency, modernization and innovation. This has been a keen focus for our operations and engineering teams, over the past 4 years as we opened 4 new greenfield autoclaves facilities and have made upgrades to existing autoclaves, incinerators, shredders and facilities throughout our network and improved our fleet. In 2023, these teams will concentrate their efforts on 3 areas: infrastructure and system modernization, fleet replacement and route and long-haul network improvements and SafeShield container rationalization and modernization.The first area, infrastructure and system modernization, continues to progress. In 2023, our operations and engineering teams will be focused on finalizing the construction of our new state-of-the-art incineration facility in Nevada. We believe this facility will set the bar for high-capacity medical waste incineration facilities in North America, through its sustainable water usage design and technology aimed at minimizing emissions. In 2023, we also plan to upgrade over 20 facilities and leverage and deploy new system capabilities.The second area is fleet replacement and route and long-haul network improvements. We are focused on replacing and modernizing our trucks and trailers with more efficient vehicles. While this was hampered in 2022 by supply chain disruptions. We are starting to see more equipment deliveries. Route and long-haul network improvements began in 2022. We have reduced long-haul routes through a combination of removing routes from our network, strategically locating new facilities near our customers, consolidating facilities and internalizing some third-party calling. These investments are expected to improve our operational service model, which we anticipate will contribute to margin expansion over time.The final area is our SafeShield container rationalization and modernization project. As a reminder, we are transitioning from over 150 container types to less than 20. To date, over 250,000 SafeShield containers have been deployed in North America, and we anticipate completing the rollout over the next 4 years. These award-winning containers are coated with an antimicrobial protectant, which reduces the potential spread of infection while minimizing odor. They also feature an improved and more durable design in standard sizes that are nestable and stackable, allowing for more efficient transportation and storage.Turning to our ERP deployment. We are now 4 months into our Regulated Waste and Compliance Services pilot in Puerto Rico. I'm excited to share that the ERP is running smoothly, as we have been able to onboard service, bill and collect cash from our customers. Based on this successful pilot, we continue to plan our ERP rollout to the U.S. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services commercial and operational functions in the second half of 2023.Now turning to debt reduction. As a result of strong free cash flow generation and divestiture proceeds, we reduced debt by $175.4 million and finished 2022 with a debt leverage ratio of 3.28x, a year-over-year improvement of 33 points. We anticipate getting close to or hitting our 3x debt leverage ratio objective, by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Finishing with portfolio optimization. In December, we divested our Communication Solutions business in North America for $45 million. And in January, we divested our Sanypick Plastic joint venture in Spain for $2.2 million. These are our 11th and 12th divestitures since 2019, and we applied the proceeds towards debt reduction. As a result, it has afforded us the opportunity to focus on core businesses and our key business priorities like the ERP deployment and other investments in the company. Communication Solutions is the fourth and final divestiture from our legacy Communication and Related Services business. I'll now turn the call over to Janet to review our financial results.Janet H. ZelenkaThank you, Cindy. I will start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. As noted on Slide 5, revenues were $670.4 million compared to $657.3 million, in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $15.7 million, divestitures of $10.8 million and an acquisition of $2.1 million, organic revenues increased $37.5 million. Of the increase, Secure Information Destruction organic revenue growth was $24.5 million, and Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenue growth was $13 million.As noted on Slide 6, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenues were $449.3 million compared to $455.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, divestitures and an acquisition, organic revenues for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services increased 2.8%. North America Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues grew $17.9 million or 4.9%, mainly driven by our 3 pricing levers, which include pricing in existing contracts, new customer pricing and surcharges and fees. Overall volume was flat, with new sites volume growth being offset by a decline in pounds per site collected from hospitals and national accounts, which we believe was mainly due to hospital staffing challenges.International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenues declined $4.9 million or 5.3% in the fourth quarter. This decline was due to lower waste volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Secure Information Destruction delivered revenues of $221.1 million compared to $201.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, organic revenues for Secure Information Destruction increased 12.2%, mainly due to pricing, including fuel and environmental and other surcharges and higher recycled paper revenues driven by SOP pricing. For the full year of 2022, our global recycled paper volumes were about flat year-over-year.In North America, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues increased $22.8 million or 13.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Of this 13.2% growth, service revenues contributed 10.5% and recycled paper revenues contributed 2.7%. The service revenue growth was mainly driven by surcharges, including the fuel and environmental and the recycling recovery surcharges. Recycled paper contributed approximately $4.6 million, more than in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting higher SOP pricing. In international, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues increased $1.7 million or 6.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This change was mainly due to surcharges.Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $59.1 million compared to $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The $50.9 million increase was mainly due to the following: commercial pricing levers, resulting in revenue flow-through of $32 million; lower adjusted litigation, settlement and regulatory compliance expenses of $17.8 million; lower bad debt expense of $6.8 million as we lowered the reserve and our allowance for doubtful accounts, mainly due to improved collections in the fourth quarter; lower annual incentive compensation expense of $5 million; and lower self-insurance expense of $3.4 million due to favorable trends in claims. These were partially offset by higher vehicle, wage and utility-related inflationary costs of approximately $18.3 million. Additionally, in the quarter, overtime cost savings partially offset our higher headcount costs, as we focused on optimizing our staffing model and driving operational productivity throughout our organization.Net income was $31.8 million or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $17.2 million or $0.19 diluted loss per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. The difference was mainly related to higher income from operations of $50.9 million. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $200.2 million compared to $303.1 million for 2021. The year-over-year decline of $102.9 million was mainly driven by the FCPA settlement payments of $81 million, timing of vendor payments of $32.3 million and higher interest payments of $15.6 million. These were partially offset by improvements in DSO of 2 days, which has translated into approximately $16 million and operating and net working capital improvements of approximately $10 million.Adjusted income from operations was $90.6 million or 13.5%, as a percentage of revenues compared to $64.2 million or 9.8% as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted income from operations increased 370 basis points, mainly driven by: revenue flow-through of 480 basis points, lower bad debt expense of 100 basis points, lower annual incentive compensation expense of 80 basis points and lower self-insurance expense of 50 basis points. These were partially offset by higher vehicle, wage and utility-related inflationary costs of approximately 270 basis points.Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60 compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2021. As illustrated on the bridge on Slide 8, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, divestitures and an acquisition of $0.01, the remaining $0.23 year-over-year increase was driven by $0.26 from revenue flow-through, $0.09 from favorable SG&amp;A expenses, mainly due to lower bad debt expense of $0.05 and lower annual incentive compensation of $0.04, $0.03 from lower self-insurance expense and $0.03 from taxes and other. These were partially offset by $0.15 from higher vehicle, wage and utility-related inflationary costs and $0.03 from interest expense.Capital expenditures for 2022 were $132.2 million compared to $116.9 million for 2021, which is in line with the guidance, I previously shared of $125 million to $135 million. Free cash flow for 2022 was $68 million compared to $186.2 million in 2021. As noted on Slide 9, the year-over-year decline of $118.2 million was mainly driven by the lower operating cash due to FCPA settlement payments of $81 million. And higher capital expenditures of $15.3 million, mainly attributable to the timing of cash payments and operational infrastructure investments.As a reminder, in the third quarter, I provided guidance on how we would achieve free cash flow expansion of $100 million to $120 million from the third to the fourth quarter. Sequentially, our free cash flow improved approximately $105 million as follows: about $47 million from improved collections, which was within our expected range of $40 million to $50 million. This improvement was driven by substantially catching up on our North America Secure Information Destruction billing and collection efforts from the ERP deployment in 2021; $25 million from lower interest payments, which was in line with expectations; $10 million of lower capital expenditures, which was within our stated range of spending $7 million to $17 million less in the quarter; approximately $20 million less in vendor payments, which is below our target of $30 million.Our fourth quarter DSO as reported, was 56 days compared to 58 days in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sequentially, from the third quarter 2022 to the fourth quarter, DSO improved 7 days. As shown on Slide 10, at the end of the fourth quarter, our credit agreement defined debt leverage ratio was 3.28x. Sequentially from the third quarter 2022 to the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio improved almost half a turn. Net debt was reduced by $175.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, reducing net debt for the year ended December 31, 2022, to approximately $1.46 billion.Turning to the full year results on Slide 12. Revenues were $2.7 billion compared to $2.65 billion in 2021. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $53.4 million, divestitures of $52.7 million and an acquisition of $8.1 million, organic revenues increased $155.8 million. Of the increase, Secure Information Destruction organic revenue growth was $129 million, and Regulated Waste and Compliance Services organic revenue growth was $26.8 million. When 2022 and 2021 results are normalized to exclude the revenues from our most recently divested businesses, Communication Solutions and Sanypick Plastics, revenues were approximately $2.64 billion in 2022 compared to $2.52 billion in 2021.Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $153.7 million compared to $72.3 million in 2021. The $81.4 million increase was mainly due to commercial pricing levers, resulting in revenue flow-through of $116.7 million, lower adjusted litigation, settlements and regulatory compliance expenses of $63.1 million. As we had accrued approximately $80 million for the FCPA settlement expenses in 2021, versus approximately $10 million in 2022. Lower North America ERP implementation operating expenditures of $39.7 million, lower self-insurance expense of $11.7 million and lower annual incentive compensation expense of $9.9 million. These were partially offset by higher vehicle, wage, utility and facility-related inflationary costs of approximately $65.5 million, higher ongoing IT operating costs of $33 million associated with our August 2021 ERP deployment now reported in our ongoing expenses, higher headcount onboarding and overtime costs of $27 million and higher bad debt expense of $17.4 million.Net income for 2022 was $56 million or $0.61 diluted earnings per share compared with a net loss of $27.8 million or $0.30 diluted loss per share in 2021. The difference was mainly related to higher income from operations of $81.4 million, as previously discussed. Adjusted EBITDA was $432.2 million in 2022 compared to $457.8 million in 2021. The $25.6 million decline was mainly due to higher ongoing IT operating costs of $33 million associated with our August 2021 ERP deployment, now reported on our ongoing expenses.In 2022, Communication Solutions and Sanypick Plastics divested operations generated approximately $13 million in adjusted EBITDA. When 2022 results are normalized to exclude results from these divested businesses, 2022 adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $419 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.04 in 2022 compared to $2.19 in 2021. As illustrated on the bridge on Slide 15, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, divestitures and an acquisition of $0.06, the remaining $0.09 year-over-year decrease was driven by $0.51 from higher vehicle, wage and utility-related inflationary costs, $0.26 from higher ongoing IT operating costs associated with our August 2021 ERP deployment, as reported in our ongoing expenses, $0.21 from higher headcount onboarding and overtime costs and $0.03 from interest expense. These were partially offset by $0.73 from revenue flow-through, $0.11 from the nonrecurring typical ERP start-up challenges in the third quarter of 2021 and $0.08 from lower taxes.As anticipated and discussed in our earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS of $1.25 in the second half of 2022, was better than our adjusted EPS in the first half of 2022 of $0.79. The following 2023 guidance includes forward-looking statements as contemplated in our safe harbor provision as referenced at the opening of this call.Our guidance for 2023, which considers the current macroeconomic headwinds and health care staffing shortfalls is shown on Slide 16 and is as follows: first, we expect to grow organic revenues 3% to 5% on a base of $2.64 billion, which has been normalized for divestitures; second, 2022 adjusted EPS was $2.04. After normalizing 2022 results for our 2 recent divestitures, the adjusted EPS baseline is $1.94. In 2023, we expect to generate adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.75 to $2.05. Anticipated underlying operating margin growth is expected to be tempered by higher incentive and stock-based compensation costs of approximately $0.20 to $0.25, and higher income taxes and interest of $0.10 to $0.15.Third, 2022 free cash flow was $68 million. After normalizing 2022 results for our 2 recent divestitures, their free cash flow baseline is $55 million. As a reminder, we paid $81 million of the FCPA settlement in 2022. In 2023, we expect to generate free cash flow in a range of $175 million to $205 million. This takes into consideration our expectation that in 2023, we will pay approximately $10 million for the remaining portion of the FCPA settlement and $5 million to $10 million in adjusted FCPA monitor and related costs.Fourth, we expect cash paid for capital expenditures of $125 million to $145 million. Fifth, as Cindy mentioned, we anticipate getting close to or hitting our 3x debt leverage ratio objective by the end of the first quarter of 2023. We are also providing our updated long-term outlook as shown on Slide 17, which takes into consideration current anticipated macroeconomic trends and the impacts of recent divestitures, and includes forward-looking statements.First, we continue to expect to achieve a compounded annual organic revenue growth rate of 3% to 5%. Second, going forward, we will be enhancing our guidance metrics by focusing on adjusted EBITDA growth and free cash flow conversion rates, and transitioning away from an absolute free cash flow dollar target. We believe these metrics will allow our investors to consistently measure the performance of our business since we now have a full year of ERP ongoing IT operating costs, included in our adjusted EBITDA baseline. We expect to achieve an average annual adjusted EBITDA growth rate of 13% to 17% through 2027 with 2023, as the base year.We expect to achieve a free cash flow conversion rate based on adjusted EBITDA of 50% to 60% beginning in 2024. These metrics translate into a free cash flow range between $325 million to $375 million between 2025 and 2026. This is lower than the previous outlook of at least $400 million of free cash flow in 2025, mainly due to: expected short-term macroeconomic trends, impacting the business that are reflected in the 2023 guidance; the recent Communication Solutions divestiture, for which we had anticipated future free cash flow of $20 million to $30 million; higher anticipated income tax payments of $10 million to $15 million; and higher anticipated interest payments of $5 million to $10 million based on the current interest rate environment.In the future, I will mainly discuss the long-term outlook in the context of adjusted EBITDA growth, and free cash flow conversion rates. This outlook is based on currently known items and certain business assumptions, including current foreign exchange rates and estimates for SOP and other commodity pricing. This outlook does not contemplate a prolonged recession, inflationary environment or persistent health care staffing challenges impacting volume. It also excludes any future acquisitions and divestitures. I will now turn the call back to Cindy.Cindy J. MillerThank you, Janet. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, team members and the communities we serve and our shareholders for their continued trust in having Stericycle protect what matters. Operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets.Sean Wilfred DodgeAnd I guess, first, congratulations on the fourth quarter free cash flow performance. That was a big lift to get to the targets that are so -- so well done. Maybe just starting with the 2023 guidance, the 3% to 5% revenue growth off the base adjusted for the divestitures. Cindy, the underlying drivers of that, the benefits you've been getting from pricing via the surcharges, those were, I think you said $10 million in the fourth quarter. How should we think about the cadence of those over the course of 2023? I just -- do you have some levers left, you can still pull on pricing or is that pretty much tapped out? I guess that'd be my first question.Cindy J. MillerNo, Sean, thanks for that question, and thanks for the recognition on the free cash flow. That was a great job by everybody involved. But I think -- so just a quick reminder. We've got 3 ways to get price. We have renewals, we've got new customers, that we're going to win, new sites that we haven't started yet. And we've got surcharges and fees.So if you -- let's look at the surcharges. We -- everybody, especially we felt the push of that capital eye of inflation in Q1 of 2022 and reacted, as quickly as we could. So it wasn't -- we got some of the fees in, let's say, end, really to the end of Q1, beginning of Q2. And then a lot of the other fees and surcharges in contractual language, you've got to give 30 days or a 60-day kind of warning, if you will, that some of these are coming. So you may put them in to implement but it doesn't necessarily hit, the day that inflation hits you.So as we look at our opportunity to grow 3% to 5% over the long haul, a lot of things are going to go into it. We will, at some point in time, have an opportunity where we will lap certain customers that already have had the increase put in, but we have an awful lot of renewal customers whose contracts weren't opened yet, that those contracts will be open this year and we will negotiate, just as we did with the customer base last year.And then we've got new prices, new rate cards, new base tariffs built into all the new customers that we haven't hit yet. So I think in conjunction, we still have runway with reference to some surcharges and fees. But I think, we also have opportunity now. I think a couple of things are positive. Businesses are coming back to work. And right now, what we are seeing on the hospital side is visits are coming back, people are visiting the hospital. They're going back to the doctor. Elective surgeries is not -- hasn't shown itself to be a positive yet. But I think all those other signs are encouraging that if the economy stays relatively stable, we don't have another hit of high inflation, that nobody expects. I think as things, if you will, maybe normalize, I think we are well positioned to capture that revenue growth and hit targets.Sean Wilfred DodgeOkay. And then the ERP, you said you completed the Puerto Rico pilot and North America, that rollout should begin in the second half of the year. Are there any updates you can share just regarding how long you expect the North American rollout to take? And I guess, at this point, what and when are the elements or transitions that you're kind of worried most about?Janet H. ZelenkaSean, this is Janet. So we are anticipating, right now, based on the success of Puerto Rico and what the team is working on, in the second half of the year to roll out the U.S., and that would be U.S. at once because we have enough confidence from what we learned from Puerto Rico. We think Canada would be a fast follower. That's a much smaller part of the revenue share. So really, we would get the bulk in this year. So that is the plan and that is what the team is targeting.What we're most worried about? This is the commercial and operational side of RWCS. The good news is we're in production, so I'm not worried about moving the system of production. I'm not worried about the shared services and general ledger or the payables for invoicing or vendors because that is in for both businesses. So we're really focused on the infield operations and the commercial side of this.The good news is we have 5,000 people who know how to use this. They are already explaining to the RWCS side, from the Shred-it side how this works. That happened in Puerto Rico and that was a good success. So the key area is data. I don't think it's as much functionality, as it is getting all the data ready for years of multiple different ways. The data was captured in RWCS to the acquisitions to standardize it, clean it, certify it and convert it and move it into the platform.OperatorOur next question comes from David Manthey from Baird.David John MantheyMy first question, if you look at Slide 15, it provides a very clear bridge from 2021 to 2022 EPS. Could you maybe provide us the major segments of the bridge from the, what you call, the base 2022 EPS of $1.94, to the midpoint of your 2023 guidance at $1.90?Janet H. ZelenkaYes, thank you, David. So thanks for capturing that. We do have a new -- with the comps all adjusted out, we go from a base of $2.04, which we oriented, to the $1.94. So really, our key drivers, our revenue flow-through and margin expansion are one of the key drivers. We do -- we also get some benefit in the free cash flow side from a lower incentive compensation payout. But if you're looking at EPS, it's primarily due to core growth. And we also get some upside on bad debt, as we look year-over-year as we've captured receivables. So we really see a clear pathway by the different measures to get to that growth.David John MantheyOkay. And then on the longer-term outlook, 3% to 5% organic revenue growth, seems very reasonable. But what gives you confidence in the 13% to 17% EBITDA growth, over the next 4 years? I think if you stretched this out, the 2027 level would be something like 23% EBITDA margin. So here, too, if you could just talk about, what are the key drivers behind the improvement from where we are to that level?Janet H. ZelenkaSo great question, Dave. And it's really a convergence of all the things we've been working in the business over the last 3 years. So it is the quality of revenue and the pricing into the contracts and the next phase of what we call quality of revenue in these areas of commercial excellence will drive, continue to drive price and volume in the market on a new platform. It is operational efficiencies that are driven by the modernization, a new incinerator going live, new autoclaves, modernized autoclaves, everything that Cindy mentioned, route optimization and leveraging the systems that are not still fully in, until we get to this year with the RWCS.And then you get the system reduction eventually of $20 million to $30 million, when we get the international off the platform so you get an uplift there. And then from the new system and having everything in North America 1 platform, you get back office efficiencies. As we continue to reduce debt, you'll get lower interest expense coming through. That will be offset by some cash taxes that we see will be a higher cash taxpayer. So that is the bridge that gives us confidence to put out that adjusted EPS growth rate, and that free cash flow conversion rate.Cindy J. MillerAnd Dave, I think the bigger story, that's a great question. And it's one, unfortunately in this journey, we would have never picked to have all of those things, in essence, hit in relatively 1 year. If you think about this journey, we -- without a pandemic, we would have had the ERP already in. We would have been chugging along with that. We would have been fine-tuning things. Facilities would have been a much -- maybe a more linear pace in terms of that type of growth.But unfortunately, we're the little engine that could. We adapt to whatever we see that's out there in the marketplace. And as a result, Janet mentioned those things just -- they're going to converge maybe a little bit more close together than we would have liked. But it still doesn't -- these are still goals and targets that we're well focused on hitting. And when they all converge, that's -- we'll handle that as we go through, but those are the expectations and that's how we see line of sight to things.So I appreciate the question, but this journey, this transformation has really not been linear. We had good intentions, in terms of laid out plans, but sometimes pandemics just didn't show up when they should have or some high inflation or some potential recession. But I think everybody with -- inside the organization is very focused on making sure that we maximize these opportunities that we've created as they hit.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel.Michael Edward HoffmanNot sure which one to start with. Given that you're setting a baseline compounding for your EBITDA, can you tell us what the expectation is for your '23 EBITDA? And, if it's not because you're not disclosing that, and is there anything weird between the earnings per share at the midpoint and the EBITDA line that I have to think about to be able to back into it?Janet H. ZelenkaYes, so I understand what you're asking, Michael. So when we gave adjusted EPS guidance, but I would say, that we are assuming increasing interest rates with in respect to unfavorable impact, about $0.05. And this is on the slide that we have in the deck, and we are expecting an unfavorable impact. This wouldn't impact the conversion. But just so you know, $0.02 to $0.03 in depreciation expense. And we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 26% to 29%, which we think is a 5% to 9% impact, because it's more normalized income tax levels in 2023.So those are some of the key areas that would back you into an expectation of EBITDA. And on an adjusted basis, if you're looking at GAAP EBITDA, we also have the indications of the adjusted items primarily in the FCPA area of costs, that we have estimated.Michael Edward HoffmanRight. Okay. And then to go back to the 3% to 5% sales growth, so for '23, not the long-term compounding. Can you unpack the mix between price, unit growth and your SOP assumption just so we understand what you're seeing in '23 versus the long term?Janet H. ZelenkaYes. So due to the headwinds we're seeing in the RWCS volume right now in elective surgeries, we're hopeful there. But I would say our growth in both Shred and RWCS, which I actually think is a good story as we forecast that range is more indexed to price on the lower range. And then, if we have some tailwinds on volume as things recover in the market, we could get to the higher range. So I think it indicates that we have pricing power that's sustainable through next year. In terms of SOP, we estimated what it ended at December for the SOP pricing through the rest of the year, and those are our key assumptions in revenue.Michael Edward HoffmanAnd what's that number just so we all have it accurately?Janet H. ZelenkaI will have someone...Cindy J. MillerIt's [2 20], I believe.Janet H. ZelenkaYes, [2 20].Michael Edward HoffmanOkay. So many more questions.Janet H. ZelenkaWell, the good news, I hope, Michael, is we have a lot of information throughout in the slides, the script, the K. So hopefully, we'll have everything we can...Cindy J. MillerYes, there's a lot to digest and we do understand that.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerJust following up on the SOP real quick. Janet, that's -- at the end of December, the [2 20], are you extrapolating that through 2023 or you say you're making your...Janet H. ZelenkaYes, so we don't predict SOP pricing. I think it's proven to be hard to predict. So we just as an assumption, so assume, the end of year as a flat through our guidance expectations.Scott Andrew SchneebergerAnd then next question, the cadence through the year of 2023, how should we think about that? Maybe some thoughts on first quarter, how that may compare sequentially or year-over-year? Just so we're out of the gate modeling appropriately. And is this -- do you expect more to come through in the back half? How does this year look?Janet H. ZelenkaYes. So actually, when we look at the quarterly cadence, it is fairly -- it's not the same that we had last year, where the first half was significantly different than the second half. We see sort of a reasonable steady cadence. Now the pricing levers will be the surcharges carry momentum into the first quarter, but then our other pricing levers start to carry momentum into the rest of the year, as we continue to renew contracts, increase our rate cards and do other things.So we see a relatively stable. We'll see what the macroeconomic headwinds do for us in terms of volume. But if we see the volume, as we expect, gate some what we're seeing today, I think we will not have that kind of impact. On the cash side, however, Q1 and Q3 are our heavy cash outlay areas due to interest, paying any bonus payments, et cetera. So you do see that in our seasonality on cash. The 2 -- Q2 and Q4 are higher cash-generating quarters, and Q1 and Q3 are higher cash outlaying quarters.Scott Andrew SchneebergerAnd then I'm going to bunch two questions into one for my final. You did do a great job with debt reduction and leverage reduction, and you're guiding that by the end of the first quarter '23, you'll get down to the 3 or sub-3. What should we think about for your leverage going forward? It sounds like you all have outlined further debt reduction will be use of capital. But how should we think about that? What is your target thereafter because you kind of achieved this one and congrats for achieving it on time.And then the second part of the question is, it sounds like you have a lot of need for capital spend on facilities. Cindy, you mentioned it's not linear. You guided CapEx for '23. How should we think about CapEx in your longer-term free cash flow guidance? What element is CapEx in that, as a percent of revenue or otherwise, however you have to qualify?Janet H. ZelenkaRight. So I'll hit the debt reduction first. And just to be clear, we think we'll get to the 3x in the first quarter or get close, so it'll be in the first quarter or second quarter, but we think we're going to get closer hit it in the first quarter, just to be clear there. In terms of how we'll use our cash that we generate, we do have a capital expenditure for this year. So our first priority after reducing debt is to invest in ourselves and you see that.And we're limited by the capacity of us to spend money, as we've learned in prior years through the major projects, the amount of people you need from engineers to IT people to everything to execute on that. But as we look at our priorities for what we use with our cash debt, if all goes well, we'll generate cash and we'll continue to apply the debt. But it does leave us opportunities in the future years to look at other capital allocation opportunities. But our first priorities will be, this year, debt and capital investment in the business.And in terms of long-term capital, it will range based on the major projects. I think we will move from heavy modernization, as we complete some of those major projects like the incinerator center to making sure we maintain the right maintenance success going forward. The team is working on that plan. I don't -- I think it's in the range of what you've seen before, but I don't have a precise target for capital.And then if -- one of the other opportunities we have with the debt is 3x is probably not enough, if we want to get to investment grade. So it would probably have to be more in the 2.5x range. So that is something we may just naturally get to by the cash generation, that we generate. And, I think, I answered both of your questions. Did I miss anything?Scott Andrew SchneebergerNo, you got it Janet. Thank you. Appreciate it. I'll turn it over.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research.Kevin Mark SteinkeI just wanted to clarify your comments around the 3% to 5% organic revenue growth guidance for 2023. It sounds like you're maybe baking some macro headwinds into that. Is that correct? Or just any more comments on the macro, and how you see it impacting 2023?Janet H. ZelenkaSo we are seeing that there's some durability in some of the headwinds. And so I do -- we do think elective surgeries will recover. If they recover faster, that will help us than the current pace of recovery that they're having. So that's one of the key drivers of what I'd say is a headwind versus tailwind. So we did have some of that factored in, and that's why you have a range of 3% to 5%.And then at the EPS level, there is persistence in some of the inflationary pressures, that a lot of people are seeing in the market. So we were, I would say, appropriate, given what we're seeing today in persistent inflation. If some of those mitigate because it's not just about fuel, it's about containers that are based on petroleum-based products. It's based on current rent and other utility costs, et cetera, that have stayed high. So we factored that kind of persisting in 2023, which is why that is in the base line. So headwinds are factored into that range and tailwinds could give us some opportunities.Cindy J. MillerYes. And Kevin, just a general reminder and for everybody, how we look at volume, I think it's important every -- lots of companies look at volumes different ways, even hospitals. But for us, we -- volume turns into -- we talk about volume in 2 different ways. Number 1 is we'll win a new site, a new customer. And if we've got a subscription fee, as an example, with an independent doctor's office, an independent customer, we'll get a subscription fee that covers everything. And weight may not -- the physical weight or the pounds, that we may pull out of that place might not matter because it's a subscription fee.Then we'll look at hospitals and national accounts and volume could take on a different -- volume has a different metric. Volume will be how many pounds are we pulling out based off of elective surgeries that are performed. And there's a price per pound component to that. And in all of our -- and in the hospital and national accounts, that's about 35% to 40% of revenue that, that weight -- the actual weight of what we pull out generates. So for us, we'll see hospitals talking about visits are up, and that's great news. People are out and about. They're going back to hospitals, and they're going back to doctors.More importantly, we're encouraged and we're hopeful that staffing in these hospitals and in the health care network continues to show improvement. And if that does, there should be an assumption that elective surgeries, at some point in time, the knees, the hips and a lot of those types of orthopedic surgeries come back, as they generate a good bit of waste. And as that kind of returns to a normal, that is opportunity for us because we're well positioned to handle that volume.So for us, when we say volume was flat in Q4, that meant we were winning more sites. We were bringing in new customers, on both sides of the business but the actual -- so volume on sites was positive but volume in terms of weight wasn't. So that kind of yielded a flat look for Q4 in '22. But I think, as Janet had said, hospitals get staffing more in line. People are feeling more comfortable going back to hospitals and to the doctor's office. I think that to follow will be elective surgeries, and I think that's a good sign for us.Kevin Mark SteinkeOkay, great. That's very helpful color. Just one other one. Have you contemplated in the 2023 guidance, any sort of potential disruption to revenue from the ERP rollout in the U.S.? I know you had a lot of learnings from the Secure Information Destruction rollout, the pilot in Puerto Rico is going well. But just any comments on potential impact there or any assumptions around that?Cindy J. MillerYes. Kevin, you're kind, calling it learnings. We did have learnings from -- on the Shred side. But I think, Janet can give maybe more specific color. I'm very confident. We came out of the gate in Puerto Rico and certainly hit the usual snafus that you would hit. But that's why we chose to do it in a pilot. And I think, we've had quite a few months to work through any of those little ah-has or surprises. So Janet, you feel pretty comfortable with that.Janet H. ZelenkaYes. If you look at the range that we have and you look at the disruption that we attributed at the EPS, about $0.11 for Shred. And that was putting it into production for the first time. Only a couple of hundred people knowing the system, first time doing data conversion, et cetera. I think our ranges cover any potential risk there. And we're working to not have that be a risk factor.OperatorThat concludes our Q&amp;A session, so I'll hand back over to Cindy Miller for closing remarks.Cindy J. MillerThank you, Maxine.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, American Airlines is expected to post earnings of $0.01 per share, indicating a change of +100.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -177.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.16 points to a change of +332% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +21.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.73 indicates a change of +26.1% from what American Airlines is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, American Airlines is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For American Airlines, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +37.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.57 billion and $55.53 billion estimates indicate +9.4% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Airlines reported revenues of $13.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.9%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with -$1.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +2.63%.Over the last four quarters, American Airlines surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Airlines is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Airlines. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Looking forward to 2023, we are excited to continue executing our Clean Energy Blueprint across Iowa and Wisconsin and delivering the safe, reliable and affordable energy our customers and communities count on.""Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $2.74 per share of GAAP EPS in 2022, which was $0.22 per share higher than 2021. The primary drivers of higher EPS were revenue requirements and allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) from Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL) capital investments and higher temperature-normalized retail electric and gas margins. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expenses.Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent operations generated $(0.13) per share of GAAP EPS in 2022, which was $0.12 per share lower than 2021. The lower EPS was primarily driven by higher financing expense and a non-GAAP charge related to the Iowa state income tax rate change.Story continuesEarnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2022 excludes $0.03 per share of charges related to the Iowa state income tax rate change for Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent, $0.02 per share of charges related to retirement plan settlement losses for Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Corporate Services, and $0.02 per share of charges related to an ATC base return on equity (ROE) reserve adjustment. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.Estimated Net Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS - The estimated impacts of net temperatures on retail electric and gas sales were $0.07 per share and $0.05 per share gains in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 per share and $2.58 per share for years 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represents 6% growth.Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between 2022 and 2021 for Alliant Energy are as follows:VarianceRevenue requirements and higher AFUDC from WPL capital investments$0.18Estimated net temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales0.02Higher financing expense(0.07)Higher depreciation expense(0.04)Iowa state income tax rate change(0.03)Retirement plan settlement losses(0.02)ATC ROE reserve adjustments(0.02)Other (includes higher electric and gas margins)0.08Total$0.10Revenue requirements and higher AFUDC from WPL capital investments - In December 2021, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approving WPL’s proposed settlement for its retail electric and gas rate review covering the 2022/2023 Test Period. WPL recognized a $0.08 per share increase in 2022 due to higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base, including investments in solar generation. The construction activity related to these investments also resulted in $0.10 per share higher AFUDC in 2022.Estimated net temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales - Alliant Energy’s retail electric and gas sales increased in 2022 and 2021 due to impacts of temperatures on customer demand.A portion of Alliant Energy’s incentive pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2022 was offset by higher incentive pay expense. Alliant Energy’s estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales, net of the portion of incentive pay associated with temperature impacts on earnings was estimated to be a $0.07 per share increase in earnings in 2022. In 2021, no adjustments were made to the temperature impact of electric and gas sales because impacts were not material.Higher financing expense - Total long-term debt increased due to additional financings in 2022 largely to fund capital expenditures, including the solar expansion program in Wisconsin. In addition, increases in short-term debt interest rates during 2022 contributed to higher interest expense in 2022 compared to 2021. These items were partially offset by the redemption of Interstate Power and Light Company’s (IPL’s) preferred stock in 2021, including a non-cash redemption charge.Iowa state income tax rate change - In September 2022, the Iowa Department of Revenue announced a change in the Iowa corporate income tax rate from 9.8% to 8.4%, effective January 1, 2023, in accordance with legislation enacted in 2022. The announced change in the corporate income tax rate resulted in a non-GAAP charge of $8 million or $0.03 per share recorded to income tax expense in the third quarter of 2022 related to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets at the Non-utility and Parent operations. The lower tax rate also resulted in a reduction in regulatory assets recorded in 2022 related to the remeasurement of deferred income tax liabilities at IPL, which will provide cost benefits to its Iowa customers in the future.Retirement plan settlement losses - In 2022, Alliant Energy recorded settlement losses as a result of a larger amount of lump sum retirement payments made under IPL’s qualified defined benefit pension plan resulting in a pre-tax non-GAAP charge of $7 million or $0.02 per share.ATC ROE reserve adjustments - In 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) prior orders that established the ROE authorized for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) transmission owners, including ITC Midwest LLC and ATC, and remanded the cases to FERC for further proceedings. This may result in additional changes to the base ROE authorized for the MISO transmission owners. As a result of this decision, Alliant Energy recorded a $6 million pre-tax non-GAAP charge in 2022 to reflect the anticipated reduction in the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners.2023 Earnings GuidanceAlliant Energy is affirming its EPS guidance for 2023 of $2.82 - $2.96. Drivers for Alliant Energy’s 2023 EPS guidance include, but are not limited to:Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of returnStable economy and resulting implications on utility salesNormal temperatures in its utility service territoriesExecution of cost controlsExecution of capital expenditure and financing plansImpacts of elevated interest rates on financing plansConsolidated effective tax rate of 1%The 2023 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, future changes in laws including corporate tax reform in Iowa, regulations or regulatory policies, changes in credit loss liabilities related to guarantees, pending lawsuits and disputes, settlement charges related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, impacts from changes to the authorized return on equity for the American Transmission Company, changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy, or certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management’s view, not reflective of ongoing operations.Earnings Conference CallA conference call to review the 2022 results is scheduled for Friday, February 24, 2023 at 9 a.m. central time.

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), including the sections therein titled ""Risk Factors,"" and its other filings with the SEC.Without limitation, the expectations with respect to 2023 earnings guidance in this press release are forward-looking statements and are based in part on certain assumptions made by Alliant Energy, some of which are referred to in the forward-looking statements. Alliant Energy cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward-looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to be correct. Any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy’s ability to achieve the estimates or other targets included in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Alliant Energy undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include income and EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 excluding charges related to retirement plan settlement losses and adjustments to the ATC ROE reserve. These measures also include income and EPS for year ended December 31, 2022 excluding a charge related to the Iowa state income tax change. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that will be reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2022 Form 10-K.This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.The tax impact adjustments represent the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow and in the case of temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS, in the press release above.Note: Unless otherwise noted, all ""per share"" references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATIONFULL YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY (Unaudited)The following tables provide a summary

For more food companies, head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Stocks. The food industry is one of the most crucial sectors in the world, and one that is also often thought of as a harbor against recession. The reasoning for this argues that during an economic downturn, while consumers will reduce their luxury spending, and put off buying an iPhone for example, they still have to buy food. Additionally, the food industry is also one of the largest in the world since it does not have to worry about creating demand and instead has to think of innovative ways to manage demand and out compete rivals in business processes such as logistics and supply chain management.Taking a look at the monetary estimates of the industry, a research report from Fortune Business Insights spells out the sheer scale of the sector. Zoning in on the food processing market, it points out that the sector was worth a whopping $2.3 trillion in 2021, and adds that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% to be worth an estimated $5.1 trillion by 2029.The sector's strength is evidenced by this CAGR, as trillion dollar industries generally do not have growth rates that end up exceeding 5%. The research firm outlines that the market growth will be supported by several trends, such as the growth in vegetarian diets, the surge in migration to cities, an increase in online ordering, and higher disposable incomes to spend on dining out.Today, we will take a look at some of the most profitable food companies in the world, and some of them are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Nestlé S.A.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. Specifically, the CHMP recommended the Libtayo combination be approved in the European Union (EU) for first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ≥1% PD-L1 expression. This includes patients that have no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations and whose tumors are metastatic or locally advanced and not candidates for definitive chemoradiation.The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on the application in the coming months. In November 2022, the Libtayo combination was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression.The positive opinion is supported by results from the global Phase 3 EMPOWER-Lung 3 trial, which was designed to closely resemble a patient population with varied disease presentations that physicians manage in everyday clinical practice. At the primary analysis with a median follow-up of 16 months, the trial showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients treated with the Libtayo combination (n=312) compared to chemotherapy alone (n=154) in the overall population (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 to 0.93).Among the 466 patients enrolled in the trial, 70% of patients (n=327) had tumors expressing PD-L1 ≥1%. Comparing the Libtayo combination (n=217) to chemotherapy alone (n=110), efficacy results in this population showed a:22-month versus 13-month median OS with a median follow-up of 16 months. This represented a 45% relative reduction in the risk of death in the trial (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.78).Continued clinically meaningful survival benefit with a median duration of follow-up of 28 months (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.69).Story continuesImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue during or after treatment with Libtayo. Among those measured for safety in the trial (n=465), adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included anemia (44%), alopecia (37%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), nausea (25%), fatigue (23%), peripheral neuropathy (21%), hyperglycemia (18%), decreased appetite (17%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (15%), neutropenia (15%), constipation (14%), dyspnoea (13%), rash (13%), thrombocytopenia (13%), vomiting (12%), diarrhea (11%), insomnia (11%), weight decreased (11%) and hypoalbuminemia (10%). Adverse events were serious in 25% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation of Libtayo in 5% of patients.Libtayo is currently approved in the EU and other countries for the treatment of certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), advanced NSCLC and advanced cervical cancer.About the Phase 3 TrialEMPOWER-Lung 3 was a randomized, multicenter Phase 3 trial investigating Libtayo in combination with a physician’s choice of platinum-doublet chemotherapy, compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. The trial enrolled 466 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as well as squamous or non-squamous histologies across all PD-L1 expression levels and with no ALK, EGFR or ROS1 aberrations.Among those enrolled, 43% had tumors with squamous histology, 15% had locally advanced disease, and 7% had a history of brain metastases. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Libtayo or placebo, plus histology-specific platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The trial was stopped early based on a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) after the Libtayo and chemotherapy combination demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, the primary endpoint. Results of the trial at the primary endpoint were published in Nature Medicine in August 2022.In December 2022, Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy was added to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (score: 4 out of 5), for patients with advanced NSCLC across squamous and non-squamous histologies, and irrespective of PD-1 expression levels.About NSCLCLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, more than 2.2 million annual new cases have been diagnosed globally. Approximately 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages. Additionally, 70% of all NSCLC cases will have &lt;50% PD-L1 expression, making it the most common treatment setting.About Regeneron in OncologyAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer. Our oncology portfolio is built around two foundational approaches – our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo and investigational bispecific antibodies – which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop potentially synergistic treatments for a wide range of solid tumors and blood cancers.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trials website.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries, Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced BCC, advanced CSCC and advanced NSCLC, as well as in advanced cervical cancer in the EU, Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Regeneron is responsible for the development and marketing of Libtayo globally.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA. Outside of the U.S. the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsLibtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:People with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.People with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC):That cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with an HHI.That has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with an HHI, or cannot receive treatment with an HHI. This use is approved based on how many patients responded to treatment and how long they responded. Studies are ongoing to provide additional information about clinical benefit.Adults with a type of lung cancer called NSCLC:Libtayo may be used in combination with chemotherapy that contains a platinum medicine as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor does not have an abnormal “EGFR”, “ALK” or “ROS1” gene.Libtayo may be used alone as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"", AND your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.

423,2af2c974-f9e7-334e-ad78-c6579a3b6f25,UNP,2023-02-24,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific Railway and CSX",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-union-084908666.html,1677228548,STORY,"['CP.TO', 'UNP', 'CP', 'CSX', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 24, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Union Pacific Corp. UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP and CSX Corp. CSX.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2057915/3-railroad-stocks-to-watch-from-a-challenging-industryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry is suffering from headwinds raging inflation, higher interest rates, high fuel price and supply-chain disruptions. Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corp., Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and CSX Corp. appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Deciding the Industry's OutlookDividend Hikes Signal Financial Bliss: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. In 2023, CSX upped its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share.High Oil Price Hurts Bottom Line: Even though oil price has declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Naturally, operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty: The hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than anticipated in January, has highlighted the fact that we are far from being out of the woods and that inflation remains a formidable foe. CPI was up 0.5% in the first month of the year, following a 0.1% rise in December and compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise.Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 3.2% on a month-on-month basis in January. In fact, the index has declined month on month for five consecutive months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183. This rank places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 8.1% since February 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 9.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite’s fall of 6.9% and the broader sector’s decline of 8%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.83X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 4.93X. It is also above the sector’s P/B ratio of 4.44X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.3 Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States. Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) is an added positive. Union Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is 1.51%.Canadian Pacific: The company is being well-served by the uptick in revenues at key sub-groups like Grain, Potash, Forest products, Metals, minerals and consumer products, Automotive and Intermodal. We are encouraged by the Canadian Pacific’s decision to pay dividends even in the current uncertain scenario.Canadian Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one).CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to-truck transfers.CSX is trying to drive growth in this challenging environment by reducing operating expenses. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. CSX has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 4.85%.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Shares have lost about 4.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Union Pacific due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Earnings Miss at Union Pacific in Q4Union Pacific’s earnings of $2.67 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75 per share. However, despite being affected by high costs, the bottom line inched up 0.38% on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenues of $6,180 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,222.8 million. However,the top line climbed 8% on a year-over-year basis, owing to higher fuel surcharge revenues, volume growth and solid core pricing.Freight revenues, accounted for 93.3% of the top line, increased 9% to $5,768 million. Business volumes, measured by total revenue carloads, were up 1%.Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 1% year over year to $2,412 million. Total operating expenses rose 14% to $3,768 million with fuel expenses increasing 43%. Expenses on purchased services and materials increased 18%. The other cost items that have increased year over year in double digits were compensation and benefits, with expense on that front rising 10%. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated by 360 basis points to 61% due to high operating expenses.Segmental PerformanceBulk (Grain &amp; grain products, Fertilizer, Food &amp; refrigerated, Coal &amp; renewables) freight revenues were $1,933 million, up 7% year over year. Business volumes in the segment declined 3%.Industrial freight revenues totaled $1999 million, up 5% year over year. Segmental business volumes were flat year over year.Freight revenues in the Premium division were $1,836 million, up 15% year over year. Segmental business volumes increased 2% year over year.Other revenues decreased 6% to $412 million in the fourth quarter. Union Pacific exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $973 million compared with $960 million at the end of 2021 Debt (due after a year) increased to $31,648 million at the end of the fourth quarter from $27,563 million at 2021-end. In the reported quarter, Union Pacific repurchased 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $0.7 billion.For full-year 2023, management expects operating ratio to improve. Carloads for 2023 are expected to exceed industrial production. Capital expenditure is expected to be around $3.6 billion (or less than 15% of revenues).The company expects a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings) in the long term. The excess cash will be used for share buyback program.Story continuesHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, Union Pacific has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Union Pacific has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Deciding the Industry's OutlookDividend Hikes Signal Financial Bliss: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. In 2023, CSX upped its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share.High Oil Price Hurts Bottom Line: Even though oil price has declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Naturally, operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Economic Uncertainty: The hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than anticipated in January, has highlighted the fact that we are far from being out of the woods and that inflation remains a formidable foe. CPI was up 0.5% in the first month of the year, following a 0.1% rise in December and compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 3.2% on a month-on-month basis in January. In fact, the index has declined month on month for five consecutive months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183. This rank places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

427,bfcecc14-b200-3b9a-8516-91c7c69ad6a9,CSCO,2023-02-24,Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-nasdaq-csco-pretty-110102957.html,1677236462,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What Is Cisco Systems's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Cisco Systems had US$8.93b of debt in January 2023, down from US$11.5b, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$22.1b in cash, leading to a US$13.1b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Cisco Systems' LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Cisco Systems had liabilities of US$27.3b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$27.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$22.1b in cash and US$8.79b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$23.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Of course, Cisco Systems has a titanic market capitalization of US$201.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Cisco Systems also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesWhile Cisco Systems doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Cisco Systems can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Cisco Systems has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Cisco Systems actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Summing UpWhile Cisco Systems does have more liabilities than liquid assets, it also has net cash of US$13.1b. The cherry on top was that in converted 104% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$15b. So is Cisco Systems's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. Given Cisco Systems has a strong balance sheet is profitable and pays a dividend, it would be good to know how fast its dividends are growing, if at all.  You can find out instantly by clicking this link.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

There's a lot to celebrate and reflect on, especially as we center our energy on our new partnership focused on fostering climate adaptation and resilience in the Horn of Africa.Below is a conversation I had recently with Carolyn Florey, Senior Director of Mercy Corps' Technology for Development Team, reflecting on our transformational partnership, and looking forward to what's next.Carolyn: Mercy Corps and Cisco have been partnering for 15 years! Our most recent five-year Technology for Impact partnership reached more than 12 million people across 45 countries, and it has also influenced the broader humanitarian and development sector, and Mercy Corps' capacity as an organization. What results are you most proud of? Erin: I have loved seeing the programs evolve over the years - from the earliest proof of concepts and pilots, to some initiatives being replicated across other regions and scaled across the organization. The benefit of a multi-year partnership is that it has afforded us the time to test solutions, to pivot and adapt when things don't go as planned, and to scale initiatives that gained traction and had an impact. In many cases, we have identified new applications and opportunities to apply these solutions to challenges we hadn't even anticipated at the partnership's outset. When COVID-19 hit in 2020, for example, we saw how critical technology solutions were to continue supporting vulnerable populations. Mercy Corps was well positioned to respond, leveraging our work building digital communities to deliver trusted and reliable information on COVID-19, and our initiatives to digitize cash and vouchers to deliver cash assistance quicker and more efficiently to those in dire need.Story continuesWe see our funding as catalytic, so it has been gratifying to see this borne out by our Technology for Impact partnership. Our support has allowed Mercy Corps to invest in its people, tools, and tech-based programming to drive greater efficiency and impact. In doing so, Mercy Corps has been able to demonstrate the value of this support, resulting in greater institutional investment, additional funding and new partnerships that have helped further scale these efforts. It's incredible to see Cisco-supported technology initiatives now embedded in 116 Mercy Corps programs in 45 countries!Erin: How about you, Carolyn? Which initiatives do you feel have especially moved the needle for Mercy Corps' work?Carolyn: The Technology for Impact partnership was incredibly unique in that it touched everything from operations to innovation. You used the word ""catalytic"" to describe Cisco's funding - and it has truly been a catalyst for improving how Mercy Corps operates as an organization. Our monitoring and evaluation (MEL) work is a strong example of this. As humanitarians, we work in very complex and fragile environments. These include communities experiencing conflict from armed groups, acute hunger, and much uncertainty. Program monitoring and evaluating is essential to the success of our work, because it allows us to understand if our programs are creating the intended impact we seek, and truly supporting people in rapidly evolving situations. Digitizing and automating our MEL processes has been a game changer for our program teams, allowing us to have a richer, more complete understanding of our programs' impact much faster.Carolyn: In what ways are you hoping to see the partnership build on its successes and learnings as we focus on one of the most pressing issues we collectively face: climate change?Erin: I believe there is a direct link between climate change and humanitarian crises. We know that communities in low-income countries are disproportionately affected by climate change and lack the resources to adapt and respond to an increasing number of crises that can be exacerbated by climate change, such as floods and drought. Mercy Corps' new 10-year Pathway to Possibility strategy, centered around building resilient communities, resonated with Cisco and mirrored our increased focus on addressing climate change and building resilience.Mercy Corps works on some of today's toughest challenges, with communities that are at the forefront of the climate crisis. Over the course of our Technology for Impact partnership, Mercy Corps has tested, adapted, and applied innovative technology solutions to improve the way they deliver aid. It therefore made sense that we expanded our partnership, building on what we've learned and developed, and see how we can apply this approach and technology to help communities adapt and build resilience to their changing environments. I'm hoping that, as with our Technology for Impact partnership, we will be able to leverage the activities and technologies from our work in the Horn of Africa, and apply these to other regions and communities similarly affected by climate change.Erin: Carolyn, I'd love to hear your perspective on this. How do you see technology playing a role in Mercy Corps' climate resilience work? Carolyn: There are multiple ways our existing work can be expanded and adapted to build climate resilience. For example, we can combine digital cash payments with our crisis analysis work to make automatic payments in advance of severe weather. We can provide digital early warning alerts before these crises occur, and also digital information afterwards so that the communities we work with have the information they need to access services and support. Technology opens the door for us to build and achieve climate resilience from multiple angles, many of which are already reflected in our work.In Kenya, through our new partnership with Cisco, we are increasing the uptake and use of digital information services and tools among key decision-makers so they can make data-informed decisions to combat the effects of climate change - which in Kenya, looks like severe drought. We see potential in scaling this approach to the broader Horn of Africa region and beyond.Carolyn: We recently had the opportunity to visit Wajir, Kenya together and see some of our climate adaptation programming in action. What were some highlights of that experience for you? Erin: The highlight of these visits is always meeting the people: the local Mercy Corps team, their government and community partners, and probably most important, the agropastoralists, whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by climate change. It was incredibly moving to see the drought firsthand, and to listen to the stories and perspectives of those affected. While in some ways disheartening, it was also inspiring to see the many ways in which Mercy Corps is partnering with these communities to adapt to their changing environment, and innovate to improve their livelihoods.Another highlight (for the experience, not necessarily the taste): trying warm camel milk, a Wajir staple!Carolyn: Combating climate change might be the most important challenge of our lifetime, and one that obviously can't be solved by one organization alone. How is Cisco addressing climate change? What role do you think these partnerships play in tackling global issues?Erin: Cisco's purpose is to ""Power an Inclusive Future for All"" - and that also means by and with all. Collaboration with partners large and small, global and local, has always been part of our approach to driving lasting and systemic change. One area where Cisco has the potential to make a meaningful impact is with our customers. How can we help them use our products and solutions to reduce their environmental footprint and achieve their sustainability goals? We are working to reduce the energy consumption of our products, and build them using circular design principles that can extend their life cycle and reduce the amount of materials they require. But beyond that, we will continue to look at how we can continue to partner with organizations like Mercy Corps - because we have seen that when we combine the strength of the humanitarian sector's expertise with our core competencies in technology and connectivity, we can have a deeper and longer-lasting impact.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740505/Cisco-and-Mercy-Corps-Cultivating-Climate-Adaptation-and-Resilience-in-Kenya]"

(CSCO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-attracting-140002395.html,1677160802,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +2.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.96 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.72 points to a change of +10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.4 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The $56.54 billion and $58.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.7% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.9%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.18%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
