2,fdf46dcd-9647-3934-89f2-8f4885a44fd0,TXN,2022-11-23,The 25 Best Stocks to Buy for Retirement,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-best-stocks-buy-retirement-205410966.html,1668891250,STORY,"['MCD', 'GOOGL', 'CROX', 'TXN', 'NFLX', 'WBA', 'SHOP', 'META', 'PEP']","[The stock market is on a long-term downtrend as interest rates rise and inflation remains high despite a slight cool-off. Many retirement portfolios that invest in indexes such as S&amp;P500 are down at least 17% year-to-date. That is even more awful when you add inflation to the equation.Of course, no stock is immune to the downturn we currently face. Still, some stocks on the market are highly resistant to recessionary and inflationary pressures, and they have the historical performance to back that claim. There are also some highly oversold stocks with little room for more downside. Buying them now could pay dividends for decades, as market downturns have always been the best time to buy any stock.Buying when everyone is selling pays off in the long run. It isn’t a coincidence that most well-known and respected investors are contrarians. Thus, if you are looking for a retirement portfolio that you wish to hold for the long term, now is the time to buy these discounted stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI believe the following 25 are among the best stocks to buy for retirement:McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)GlobalF0undries (NASDAQ:GFS)Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)Merck (NYSE:MRK)O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY)Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)Walmart (NYSE:WMT)Costco (NASDAQ:COST)TJX (NYSE:TJX)Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO)Veritiv Corp. (NYSE:VRTV)Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B)McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a very recession-resistant stock and is one of the few stocks to have increased in value during the great recession. Even in 2020, MCD recovered very quickly despite being a restaurant chain, one of the worst affected sectors of the economy. Simply put, McDonald’s thrives in an environment of economic uncertainty. It is a solid business in a consistent long-term uptrend, making it a perfect stock if you wish to avoid volatility.Story continuesIt is also a business that will stay relevant for a lifetime. My colleague Larry Ramer notes the following:“…MCD has become such a core part of American culture — and consequently a magnet for lovers of American culture in much of the rest of the world — that its business is sure to thrive for decades to come.”Moreover, the financials are stable, and McDonald’s has an annual dividend yield of 2.2%, strengthening the argument to buy it for the long term.There is also a misconception that McDonald’s being a consumer discretionary business will make it vulnerable to economic turmoil. I’m afraid I have to disagree since previous recessions have proved quite the opposite. As higher-income customers start feeling the pinch, they start eating more at McDonald’s, causing the business to thrive.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockIf you want something more diversified, look into PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The company’s diversification strategy makes it a very stable business. Not only that, PepsiCo is diversified into many consumer staples brands, making its revenue sources very inelastic and resistant to economic downturns. Like McDonald’s, PepsiCo is on a solid footing and will remain relevant for decades. The company’s financials will reflect just that as it is on a stable, long-term uptrend, with revenue reaching $83.6 billion TTM in the last quarter, up 8.8% year-on-year. Moreover, PepsiCo has an annual dividend yield of 2.56% and reported a net income growth of 21.5%. With robust top-line and bottom-line growth, PEP is undoubtedly among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Needless to say, PEP stock won’t give you multibagger returns, but it will certainly protect your assets and counteract inflation. It’s the perfect asset to hold if you simply wish to ride out the storm.Shopify (SHOP)Shopify Inc (SHOP) Stock’s Earnings Dip Is a Chance to Buy!Source: ShutterstockShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is a Canadian e-commerce platform that rose rapidly after the pandemic. From Feb. 2020 to its peak in Nov. 2021, SHOP stock grew by 218%, but it has had a dreadful year in 2022. YTD, the stock is down just slightly above 70%. However, the trend seems to be reversing as it is up 56% from its bottom of $25.6 after beating Q3 expectations.Its top line grew at 21.6% in Q3, beating expectations by 2.3%, while its losses also beat expectations. That is great for the stock, as robust top-line growth will encourage SHOP to be valued at a higher premium.Shopify has had exceptionally robust top-line growth since its IPO, and its elevated valuation throughout 2021 was due to its YoY revenue growth of nearly 100%. With the same metric on the march higher, investors won’t mind paying more for the stock. The Bank of Canada also hints at lower interest rate hikes as the economy cools off.With those factors in mind, the outlook seems promising for Shopify going forward. I would not be surprised if the company delivered a net profit very soon, as its losses are at $158 million from $1.2 billion in Q2.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a stock many investors view negatively due to the metaverse project going poorly. The stock is down more than 65% YTD as Meta spends extravagantly on a project only a handful of people are excited about, and it’s not something many would consider among the best stocks to buy for retirement.However, I am not at all convinced that Meta will be a failed company. The metaverse may seem silly today, as it is in the very early phases of development, but there is no guarantee that it cant still turn out to be profitable a decade or so down the line. It simply might be ahead of the curve.Let’s look at a prediction from 2010:“Tens of millions of Americans will be using a social networking site far more flexible and useful and far less annoying than Facebook today. It may or may not be a vastly improved version of Facebook itself, but having a page on it will be as useful and nearly as common as having a phone. (80% of readers agree).”Twelve years later, Facebook is still the most used social media platform if you exclude YouTube. However, even if the metaverse does fail, a $700 billion-plus decline in valuation for the company seems too overdone. We’re talking about a company that owns Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger called the “Family of Apps.” All combined, it generated nearly $32 billion in operating profits in the first three quarters this year. In contrast, Meta lost a little above $9.4 billion this year from Reality Labs. That’s far from being unsustainable.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another tech stock battered by the bear market. Down 48% YTD, it has pulled off a strong recovery after introducing more revenue sources and improving its monthly active user (or MAU) count. Despite the recent surge in its price, it is still a stock with much more upside in the future due to slowing but consistent revenue growth and steady subscriber count.I argue that NFLX stock seems very oversold when comparing the stock price to pre-pandemic metrics. In Q4 2019, Netflix’s subscriber count was 167 million, and quarterly revenue was at $5.5 billion. The stock price then was around $320. Fast forward to Q3 2022, with the subscriber count at 223 million and revenue at almost $8 billion. The only thing that hasn’t changed much is NFLX’s price.Of course, one might argue that its 30%-plus top-line growth back then contributed greatly towards Netflix’s valuation. Admittedly, it has slowed down a lot. But investors should also remember the massive boost Netflix got from the pandemic. It is quite surprising that revenue isn’t plunging but still growing at a slower pace, and Netflix has retained most of its pandemic customers. The stock’s price chart says very well that investors are quickly regaining faith.Texas Instruments (TXN), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and GlobalFoundries (GFS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), and GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) are semiconductor manufacturing stocks and follow a similar trajectory. Although the past few months have been terrible for these stocks, the trend is starting to reverse, and they’re becoming very good buying opportunities.Admittedly, I was pessimistic about semiconductor stocks after the demand for GPUs fell. However, all of them have beaten their revenue expectations and continue to grow. For example, TSM’s revenue growth has surpassed even 2021 metrics, and even Warren Buffet is buying after the news.While TSM stock surges higher due to demand, I also expect GFS and TXN stocks to be great long-term bets. They could even outperform Taiwan Semiconductor due to the CHIPS act. They are both American companies that qualify for billions in subsidies.Of course, these stocks naturally move with the rest of the market and could see more downside. However, if you are looking to hold long-term, Semiconductor stocks are among the best stocks to buy for retirement. Texas Instruments, Taiwan Semiconductor, and GlobalFoundries reported YoY top-line growth at 13%, 36%, and 22%, respectively. Those are robust numbers that’ll make these stocks continue to trade at a premium.Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are considered semiconductor stocks, they do not manufacture a meaningful amount of semiconductors. Instead, they design semiconductors and manufacture them through partners such as TSMC. They produce and sell a variety of technological products.These stocks have outstanding financials and are undervalued despite the recent stock market rally. Broadcom has revenue growing at 25% YoY. The robust growth should cause AVGO stock to trade at higher levels in the long run. On the other hand, Qualcomm is even more undervalued, with a price-earnings ratio of 11x and 22% YoY quarterly revenue growth.Conversely, these stocks won’t technically qualify for the CHIPS act as they don’t manufacture their own chips. However, their growth is robust enough to make this list among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is undoubtedly among the best stocks to buy for retirement, as the Internet is incomplete without this company. As many of my colleagues have already pointed out, Alphabet owns the two most popular websites on the internet: Google.com and YouTube.com. With GOOG and GOOGL stock declining 32-plus YTD, I consider Google a low-risk, high-reward investment.GOOG and GOOGL stock trading below $100 is a once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity. Alphabet is an evergreen business that is arguably the best tech stock to buy for long-term gains. Sure, its bottom line has declined quite a lot due to the fall in advertising revenue, but the economy will inevitably roar back, and so will Alphabet’s ad sales.Gurufocus.com reinforces my view about Alphabet, rating GOOGL as “Significantly Undervalued” with a price target of $140. That’s a 42% upside. By 2026, we could be looking at nearly 100% upside on average.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another evergreen tech stock that is among the best stocks to buy for retirement. If you are a white-collar worker, you are almost guaranteed to have used a Microsoft product. You might even be reading this article on the Windows operating system. My argument is that this company is essential for most people and won’t be going under the radar anytime soon. It’s elusive at best to run a business without any Microsoft products.The company appeals to individual and corporate customers with a vast range of products. Microsoft has Bing, Edge, Windows, Office, Outlook, Skype, Teams, OneDrive, cloud services, and even games. That’s just software. It also sells many hardware products such as computers, computer accessories, Xboxes, Xbox accessories, and networking hardware. This mega-cap simply has too much potential not to be included in a retirement portfolio.In addition, the market downturn has made MSFT decline by 28% YTD and presents a very attractive buying opportunity at $240 per share. Much like Alphabet, Microsoft’s net income has also shrunk, albeit slightly less, as it does not depend too much on ad revenue. However, its top line still grew by double digits, and Microsoft plans for more layoffs to increase its profitability. Finally, the stock also has an annual dividend yield of 1.1%, which will add to any long-term gains.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is among the best stocks to buy for retirement as it lingers at $40 per share despite a promising outlook. The company is a retail pharmacy business, which much more inelastic than some of the tech companies I’ve mentioned above.The past few years have not been good for WBA stock, as it is down nearly 60% since its peak in 2015. Its share prices in 2022 are also the same as in 2001. With that in mind, it is easy to see why WBA is trading at a PE ratio of just under 8x. Moreover, its financials did outdo expectations, but the metrics are on a downtrend.Conversely, my argument for putting WBA stock on this list is due to its long-term expansion plans. The company’s management is steering Walgreens towards a healthcare business in addition to a retail one. It invested $5.2 billion in VillageMD last year, planning to offer full-service primary care with primary care physicians and pharmacists in one place. The company is planning 1,000 such locations by 2027. VillageMD itself is also planning an IPO, a company in which Walgreens Boots Alliance has a 63% stake.Furthermore, Walgreens Boots Alliance is a dividend aristocrat yielding 4.75%. Combined with its promising prospects and a low earnings multiple, I see the stock price being much higher in a few years.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a must-buy for any retirement portfolio due to the business’s relevancy. AAPL outperformed most other tech stocks and continues to beat expectations due to its products being in high demand. Not only that, the company is still hiring and expanding its workforce while most other tech companies are cutting back.Many people still have money, especially the wealthy who love Apple products, so it’s not hard to see why the company continues to be resilient. Its top and bottom line grew 8.1% and 0.8% YoY in Q3, and its fundamentals are solid.On the contrary, I do have some concerns about AAPL’s short-term value due to declining profit margins. The stock could be in for a correction once the rate hikes start to fully impact the economy and earnings take a hit. It is a well-known fact that markets bottom a few months before a recession ends; thus, if we are still in one, there could be more pain ahead. However, AAPL is still a steal at this price if you are investing for the long term.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIf you are looking for more stability, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is something you should consider in your portfolio. Don’t get me wrong; Big Blue isn’t something that will give you much upside as it’s struggling to retain its earnings and has been outperformed by the broader stock market for the past decade. What it will give you, though, is exceptional stability and a healthy dividend yield.Moreover, it is slowly starting to turn a corner by shaping the business around cloud computing, AI, and even a blockchain platform. If it continues its transition, IBM might no longer be an aging company a few years later.We are already seeing this transition pay off, as its hybrid cloud segment is becoming the driving factor of IBM’s growth. In Q3, the hybrid cloud segment had a revenue growth of 15%. In comparison, software and consulting grew at 7% and 5%, respectively. Moreover, the Q3 earnings report surpassed expectations, and IBM looks like a bargain among the best stocks to buy for retirement, considering its non-GAAP earnings multiple. These positive tailwinds can steadily carry this stock higher.Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comAs Merck (NYSE:MRK) steadily trends higher despite broader economic headwinds, it is becoming an attractive buy for retirement portfolios. The company has robust top-line growth of 13.7%, an attractive dividend yield of 2.65%, and a compelling PE ratio of 16.9x. Furthermore, it is also a pharmaceutical company, an industry with very little price elasticity. Therefore, in the case of a recession, MRK stock is unlikely to disappoint.Furthermore, Merck is partnering up with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) to develop a melanoma vaccine jointly. With more than 1.4 million Americans living with melanoma and nearly 100,000 being diagnosed yearly, this vaccine will be a great source of profit for both companies.Simply put, there is not much else to say about MRK except that it is a fairly valued stock that’ll give you stable returns for the foreseeable future. Its financials are on a solid footing, and I expect it to continue on its steady uptrend. The dividend is the icing on the cake, making MRK among the best stocks to buy for retirement.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Mechanic Working Under Vehicle in a Car ServiceSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is another solid stock for your retirement portfolio. This company is an auto parts retailer that operates 5,911 stores in the U.S. and continues to expand despite broader economic headwinds.The biggest factor positively impacting O’Reilly Automotive is that Americans are holding on to their aging vehicles for much longer. The average age of cars in the U.S. increased to 13.1 years in 2022, and that uptrend will continue as the economy cools off. As a result, business is booming for O’Reilly as more people require vehicle maintenance.In Q3, the company reported stellar earnings beating earnings-per-share estimates by 7.8%. The top line is also up 9.2% YoY. Up 18% this year, a market downturn is nowhere to be seen for ORLY. This business has almost everything going right for it, and if the company improves its profit margin in the future, we are looking at a lot of gains.Crocs (CROX)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is surging higher after a 73% decline from its peak. The company’s Q3 earnings report beat EPS by 13.7% and revenue by 4.4% and is now nothing short of a bargain. YTD, CROX is still down 28%, but I believe it will trend much higher in the long term as the business has some positive tailwinds to consider.I wrote the following about Crocs in May this year: “The stock seems oversold as its value has declined over 70% after the company announced its acquisition of HEYDUDE for $2.5 billion. Crocs remains among the most popular brands for teens despite the company’s recent downturn. Crocs’ recent earnings report was unsatisfactory due to its net income decline. However, its P/E ratio remains low, and the company’s high revenue growth can still make it profitable. Once supply chain disruptions ease, CROX stock will likely deliver a strong recovery from its current downturn.”It is now halfway through Nov. and the stock is up more than 78%, has returned to profitability, and is delivering a strong recovery from its downturn. I believe there are still more gains in the long term.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comIf Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were an e-commerce pure-play, I would not be putting it on this list of the best stocks to buy for retirement, as Shopify would be a much better pick. However, Amazon is diversified enough to remain a relevant business for decades, and investors should consider adding AMZN to their retirement portfolios.Amazon has a lot of promising segments that can drive growth once the economy roars back. This includes Amazon Web Services (or AWS), which dominates the cloud computing segment; Twitch, the most popular live streaming platform; Audible, Alexa, and a lot more. Both its top and bottom lines are making a turnaround on a quarterly basis while the stock price is at pre-pandemic levels. The stock is down 48% this year, and now is a good time to start buying if you wish to hold for the long term.Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and TJX (TJX)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockWalmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), and TJX (NYSE:TJX) are three retail stocks I’d recommend adding to your retirement portfolio for more stability. Except for COST, both WMT and TJX stocks are up this year and have resisted the volatility in the market quite well. Of course, these stocks could be in for a correction if the downturn deepens, but they are great bets for long-term resilience.Inflation is starting to cool, but without a Fed U-turn, there is still a significant risk of a recession. Thus, retail stocks shouldn’t be left out of your portfolio. For a retirement portfolio, Walmart and TJX have much more going for them than Costco. TJX and Walmart are the most undervalued of the three, with PE ratios of just under 23x, much less than Costco’s 36x. For TJX, that comes with a top-line miss this quarter, while Walmart suffers from an inventory glut.Costco is swapping hands at a much higher premium due to its higher revenue growth. It certainly has robust financials that appeal to defensive investors, but COST is starting to look a little too expensive. On the contrary, it has historically outperformed both WMT and TJX, which is why I still think Costco is among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Flowers Foods (FLO)bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display caseSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphotoFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) produces and markets packed bakery food. It has solid fundamentals and has been reporting double-digit revenue growth in the last three-quarters of this year while many other companies are slowing down.Top-line growth accelerated to 12.7%, beating expectations by 1.5%, while EPS grew 5.6%, beating forecasts. The only significant metric that is down is its profit margins, similar to most companies on this list. However, that is to be expected due to high inflation causing margin compression.Flowers Foods has been on a steady long-term uptrend for the last two decades averaging a 10.8% annual return. It is an exceptionally stable stock that closely resembles the S&amp;P500 index in gains but not so much during market downturns. In the past five years, FLO stock has gained 46% against the S&amp;P500’s 52%, but it is significantly outperforming the index YTD. In 2022, it has gained 3.3%, while the S&amp;P500 has shed 17.7%.Furthermore, this stock also has a compelling 3.1% dividend yield, making it among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Veritiv Corp (VRTV)Source: ShutterstockDespite growing 400%-plus in the last five years, 8%-plus this year, and having robust financials, Veritiv (NYSE:VRTV) trades at a very deep discount of 6 times earnings. This business-to-business provider is seeing its profits increase rapidly and reported a 142.5% YoY net income growth in Q3.Of course, packaging firms aren’t among the economy’s growth drivers, which is why VRTV stock often falls under the radar. Firms like Veritiv are expected to grow around 4% CAGR this decade. However, Veritiv offers what most investors are looking for in 2022, which is value. Per forecasts, the exceptional growth rate will likely slow down next year, but the stock will stay deeply undervalued. That makes it among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Finally, the downside risk is quite low here as it is already trading at quite a discount, but it is still one of the riskier market ideas on this list. I expect a strong upside for this company as inflation cools down and supply chain issues wane. But I won’t recommend allocating too much of your portfolio to this stock.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)Warren Buffet Stocks: a picture of warren buffett smiling.Source: Kent Sievers / Shutterstock.comWriting about the best retirement stocks to buy, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is a must. The Oracle of Omaha is arguably the best investor to follow if you are looking for long-term gains, and the best way to do it is by buying Berkshire Hathaway. The company’s portfolio is highly diversified, with almost $300 billion worth of assets under management covering almost every industry.The stock is on a long-term stable uptrend, and I see the growth continuing for the foreseeable future as Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in many essential businesses that’ll stay relevant for decades. That includes many businesses hand-picked by Warren Buffet himself.Sure, the recent market downturn has increased its losses by quite a lot. But Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on an abundance of cash at $109 billion. That is a lot of cushion going forward that the company can use for stock buybacks and covering losses. Furthermore, the top line continues to grow alongside many of the company’s businesses. Most notably, insurance contributes 27% of the company’s revenues, a very inelastic segment.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Citadel’s Tactical Trading fund gained 2.4% in September, supported by fundamental long-short and quantitative equity strategies. Griffin, who manages nearly $439 billion in client money, plans for an expansion into Asia, motivated by China President Xi Jinping’s renewed focus on the economy. Griffin said in an interview to Bloomberg on November 16:“China, given the size of its capital markets, is a center of focus for our investment team.” Ken Griffin observed that resilient growth in China could reduce the risk of a significant recession in 2023 in the world's second-largest economy. He further explained: “If we see higher growth in China, that will make the recession shallower. Seeing growth in the region accelerate only encourages us to increase the size of our commitment.” Some of the best stocks in the Ken Griffin portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 stocks from the Ken Griffin portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis.

(NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Software has been a solid long-term performer for the Strategy and a key point of differentiation versus the benchmark. But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles.We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy. We also see significant room for margin expansion. While we have trimmed our Salesforce (CRM) exposure, we maintain confidence that the stock will re-rate to a level that reflects its growth potential.”6. Humana Inc.

""He didn't say a word. He didn't say anything at all.""Using a pistol, the suspect also injured at least four people, who were being treated at area hospitals, Chesapeake Police Chief Mark Solesky told a news conference on Wednesday. He did not disclose a possible motive for the shooting, but said the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Coming on the heels of the killing of five people at a Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub on Saturday, the latest massacre prompted another round of condemnations by public officials and calls by activists for tighter gun control.U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday called the shooting ""yet another horrific and senseless act of violence,"" vowing any federal resources needed to aid in the investigation.""There are now even more tables across the country that will have empty seats this Thanksgiving,"" he said in a statement, noting a shooting earlier this month that left three University of Virginia students dead. ""We must take greater action.""Employees told media that the shooter was a manager at the cavernous Walmart Supercenter just off Battlefield Boulevard in Chesapeake, a city of about 250,000 people south of Norfolk.""The Battlefield Walmart just got shot up by one of my managers. He killed a couple of people. By the grace of God I made it out,"" another employee, Kevin Harper, told CBS.Story continuesJessie Wilczewski told WAVY-TV that she hid under a table and the shooter pointed the gun at her and told her to go home.""It didn't even look real until you could feel the pow-pow-pow. You can feel it,"" the store employee said. ""I couldn't hear it at first because I guess it was so loud. I could feel it.""Tuesday's bloodshed marked the latest spasm of gun violence in the United States, where an average of two mass shootings -- defined as an incident killing or injuring four or more people -- occur every day, according to GunViolenceArchive.org.Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, who was already facing stepped-up calls for policies to address gun violence in the wake of the University of Virginia killings, ordered flags at local, state and federal buildings to be flown at half-staff.""Heinous acts of violence have no place in our communities,"" Youngkin wrote on Twitter.It is not the first mass shooting at a Walmart, which has thousands of stores across the United States.At a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August 2019, 23 people were killed in a mass shooting near the U.S.-Mexico border in an act described as domestic terrorism by law enforcement. It was also the deadliest attack on the Hispanic community in modern times. Patrick Wood Crusius, then 21, from Allen, Texas, was arrested in the shooting and he left behind a manifesto with white nationalist and anti-immigrant themes.Walmart in a statement on Wednesday said it was ""shocked"" at the violence at the Chesapeake store and it was working closely with law enforcement.

We’re in a great position for holiday. And this compares to last year when we really didn’t have the inventory that we wanted or needed. So we feel like we’re in a much, much better position.”Even so, there are still plenty of retailers — particularly at lower income levels where inflation in food and fuel is stinging — that are looking to move excess goods this holiday season.Richard Hayne, cofounder, chairman and chief executive officer of Urban Outfitters Inc., said the company’s namesake chain started the third quarter with “heavy inventory left over from the bullwhip effect brought on by COVID-induced supply chain issues. The brand is working through this excess inventory and is planning to be much cleaner by the end of Q4.”Walmart wrestled inventories down from a 25.5 percent increase at the end of the second quarter to a 12.6 percent rise at the end of the third.And while it still has about $1 billion in goods it considers excess, that’s down from about $3 billion in July.Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said inventory has gone from stuck in the supply chain to now stacked up in the store.“We’re making improvements,” Rainey said. “Apparel and certain categories in [general merchandise] are the heavy categories, and we’ll continue to work through those.”One way or another, it’s a retail landscape with a sketchy consumer and a lot of inventory sitting around. Some of that inventory is in safer, “core” products.But no doubt, more would like to be in Macy’s position with just a small increase and an opportunity to chase goods.“Our inventory is in great shape,” said Jeff Gennette, chairman and CEO. “We have roughly 55 percent newness for holiday, 30 percentage points higher than 2019, and we are not saddled with older receipts in pandemic category overstocks.“With our strong vendor relationships and mix of private brand and licensed brands, we can chase into areas of strength that warrant it and have a flexible pricing model to quickly adjust promotions and markdowns if demand does not materialize,” Gennette said.Stocked UpSupply chain disruptions and consumer swings have many merchants sitting on a lot of inventory headed into the holiday season.Inventory at End of Most-recent Quarter (in millions)Year-over-year ChangeMacy’s Inc.$6,4034.3%American Eagle Outfitters Inc.$7987.8%Ross Stores Inc.$2,494.011.8%Gap Inc.$3,04311.8%Walmart Inc.$64,70612.6%Target Corp.$17,11714.4%Urban Outfitters Inc.$74418.6%The TJX Cos.

(NYSE:JWN) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-nordstrom-inc-100728295.html,1669198048,STORY,['JWN'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Nordstrom's shares on or after the 28th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.19 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.76 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Nordstrom stock has a trailing yield of around 3.4% on the current share price of $22.65. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Nordstrom has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Nordstrom Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Nordstrom paid out just 15% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Nordstrom paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 143%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.Story continuesNordstrom paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Nordstrom to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Nordstrom, with earnings per share up 4.7% on average over the last five years. Earnings have been growing somewhat, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Nordstrom has seen its dividend decline 3.5% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.To Sum It UpHas Nordstrom got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Nordstrom has seen its earnings per share grow steadily and paid out less than half its profit over the last year. Unfortunately, its dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Nordstrom from a dividend perspective.However if you're still interested in Nordstrom as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Nordstrom. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Nordstrom that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The Dow, which saw 27 of 30 components close higher, gained +397 points, or +1.18%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq rose an identical +1.36%, with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P closing higher (with 10 of 11 up month to date [Consumer Discresh was lower]). Even the small-cap Russell 2000, which has been fighting to keep up of late, added +1.16% for the day.Despite the overall gains, there didn’t seem to be much focus on market activity. If we want to talk retail — on the brink of holiday shopping season, as we are — we saw Best Buy BBY, fresh off its morning Q3 report, +12.75% for today. But Dollar Tree DLTR, which also beat this morning but was light on earnings forecasts, slipped -7.8% on the session. Thus, our current market appears to want to reward those companies performing strongly, but taking it from those who are doing less well.Nordstrom JWN is the latest retailer to report earnings this afternoon, posting its fourth-straight bottom-line beat with 20 cents per share outpacing the 14 cents in the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $3.55 billion in the quarter beyond the $3.51 billion analysts were looking for. These expectations had been ratcheted down on earlier guidance, so the beats don’t come as quite as much a surprise. Also, guidance looking ahead has been kept pat — instead of rising — indicating this is as good as it gets for the higher-end big-box retailer. Shares are -4.8% at this hour.We are in a holiday-shortened week, with most of the possible market catalysts focused on tomorrow morning. This includes regular Thursday morning staple Weekly Jobless Claims, along with Durable Goods, Manufacturing and Services PMI, New Home Sales and the latest Fed meeting minutes. Of these, the biggest capacity for unexpected results may come from jobless claims, which are experiencing hits from select members of Big Tech, to the tune of thousands or tens of thousands of layoffs in the past few weeks or so. Eventually these are going to show up on claims rolls.John Deere &amp; Co. DE is the final major earnings report expected ahead of Thanksgiving Day (no reports are scheduled for Thursday or Friday this week). The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated machine equipment manufacturer is expected to fetch +72% earnings growth year over year on +33% in revenue growth. Last quarter, the company broke an 11-straight-quarter earnings beat; with these metrics to overcome, it would would likely be a more meaningful beat than Nordstrom’s after the bell today.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

This compares to earnings of $0.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 42.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this department store operator would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of 1.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Nordstrom , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $3.55 billion for the quarter ended October 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.76%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Nordstrom shares have lost about 6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -17.1%.What's Next for Nordstrom?While Nordstrom has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nordstrom: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

(NYSE:MET) Looks Just Right",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metlife-inc-nyse-met-looks-110009598.html,1669201209,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PE']","[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 14x, you may consider MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 27.2x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.MetLife hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for MetLife peKeen to find out how analysts think MetLife's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For MetLife?MetLife's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 55%. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 63% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 47% each year during the coming three years according to the twelve analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that MetLife's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On MetLife's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that MetLife maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for MetLife (1 is a bit concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than MetLife. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

MetLife stock isn't showing any signs of slowing, either, as a historically bullish signal is flashing at the moment.These highs come amid historically low implied volatility (IV) for the stock, which has been a bullish combination for MET in the past. Per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been six similar instances during the past three years when the equity was within 2% of a 52-week high while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th annual percentile of of lower. MetLife stock currently sports an SVI of 24%, which sits in the 7th percentile of its 12-month range.Digging deeper, MET has averaged a 1.4% one-month return after these signals, with 83% of these returns being positive. From its current perch, this would put the equity at another record high of $77.50.An unwinding of pessimism among options traders could create even more tailwinds. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), 2.32 puts have been picked up for every call during the past 10 weeks. This ratio stands higher than all other readings from the past year, implying a much healthier-than-usual appetite for long puts of late.Echoing this, the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 1.36 stands in the 92nd percentile of its 12-month range. In other words, short-term options traders have rarely been more put-biased.]"
36,003547f1-be43-3de9-87ee-d5f85164025c,IT,2022-11-23,Gartner (IT) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gartner-great-momentum-stock-buy-170005204.html,1669136405,STORY,['IT'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Gartner (IT), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Gartner currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if IT is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this technology information and analysis company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor IT, shares are up 0.72% over the past week while the Zacks Consulting Services industry is up 0.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 14.95% compares favorably with the industry's 5.65% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Gartner have increased 16.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 5.11% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -6.17% and -14.53%, respectively.Investors should also take note of IT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, IT is averaging 518,696 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with IT.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost IT's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.08 to $9.82 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that IT is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Gartner on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These businesses are less susceptible to economic downturns, assuring stable revenue generation for the company.O has a diversified tenant base operating in 79 different industries. Apart from retail properties, its portfolio also comprises industrial and other properties. This minimizes the risks related to any particular industry, region or asset type.Realty Income’s accretive buyouts and development initiatives seem encouraging for its external growth. It anticipates incurring more than $6 billion in acquisitions in 2022.Moreover, its capital-recycling efforts highlight the company’s prudent capital management practices alongside relieving the pressure on its balance sheet.On the balance-sheet front, the company exited the third quarter of 2022 with nearly $2.5 billion of liquidity. Further, its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market.With a well-laddered debt-maturity schedule and enough financial flexibility, O is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Realty Income remains committed to that. This September, “The Monthly Dividend Company” increased its monthly cash dividend on its common stock, marking the 117th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. Given its robust financial position and a lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry, the latest dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is concerning for Realty Income. Online retailing will likely remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.A major part of O’s tenant roster comprises single-client properties, which expose it to the risks associated with tenant defaults. This could hurt the company’s rental revenues generated from that property.Also, rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 7.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

45,1d788358-c3da-3bad-8e51-66a4c1bbd208,MS,2022-11-23,Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 63%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-nyse-ms-favorite-110029023.html,1669201229,STORY,['MS'],"[If you want to know who really controls Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Morgan Stanley, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Morgan Stanley's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. With 7.2% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Morgan Stanley insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$395m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Morgan Stanley. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 22% of Morgan Stanley. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Morgan Stanley   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ken Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Citadel Investment Group, a multi-strategy hedge fund run by billionaire Ken Griffin, announced that its flagship Wellington multi-strategy fund returned 2.5% in September, bringing the year-to-date performance to about 29% at the end of September 2022. Citadel’s Tactical Trading fund gained 2.4% in September, supported by fundamental long-short and quantitative equity strategies. Griffin, who manages nearly $439 billion in client money, plans for an expansion into Asia, motivated by China President Xi Jinping’s renewed focus on the economy. Griffin said in an interview to Bloomberg on November 16:“China, given the size of its capital markets, is a center of focus for our investment team.” Ken Griffin observed that resilient growth in China could reduce the risk of a significant recession in 2023 in the world's second-largest economy. He further explained: “If we see higher growth in China, that will make the recession shallower. Seeing growth in the region accelerate only encourages us to increase the size of our commitment.” Some of the best stocks in the Ken Griffin portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 stocks from the Ken Griffin portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.5 million shares worth approximately $673 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”7. Salesforce, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), elite investors are piling into Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Software has been a solid long-term performer for the Strategy and a key point of differentiation versus the benchmark. But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles.We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy. We also see significant room for margin expansion. While we have trimmed our Salesforce (CRM) exposure, we maintain confidence that the stock will re-rate to a level that reflects its growth potential.”6. Humana Inc.

55,bee9e1a0-abb1-366f-b71d-b3f4827e0d94,PCG,2022-11-23,Biden gives PG&E $1 billion to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant open,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-gives-pg-e-1-120059251.html,1669032059,STORY,['PCGU'],"[An aerial view of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in San Luis Obispo County. (Mark Ralston / AFP via Getty Images)The case for nuclear power as a climate solution got a big boost Monday, when the Biden administration announced it's giving Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. a $1.1-billion grant to help the company keep operating California's last nuclear plant.The Diablo Canyon plant is currently scheduled to shut down in two phases, with the first reactor going offline in 2024 and the second in 2025. But Gov. Gavin Newsom has led a spirited push to keep the reactors humming five more years, saying they're badly needed to help the Golden State grapple with power shortages and worsening heat waves.The federal money doesn't guarantee Diablo Canyon will stay open longer. But it increases the likelihood of California continuing to rely on the plant, along the Central Coast in San Luis Obispo County — despite decades of anti-nuclear activism and public concerns about what would happen if an earthquake erupts along one of the seismic fault lines near the facility.PG&amp;E Chief Executive Patti Poppe noted that Diablo Canyon supplied more than 8% of California's electricity last year — and 17% of the state's climate-friendly, carbon-free electricity. She also said the plant has a strong safety record.""It is a good choice for the state of California — and for frankly the planet — that a well-performing plant like Diablo Canyon could continue to serve,"" Poppe said in an interview.The $1.1 billion in federal money comes from the infrastructure law passed by Congress and signed by President Biden last year. It should allow PG&amp;E to pay back most of the $1.4-billion loan for Diablo that state lawmakers approved at Newsom's urging.That state money is slated to help PG&amp;E cover the costs of relicensing at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as maintenance, fuel purchases and additional on-site storage for radioactive waste needed to keep the plant running past 2025.Final terms of the federal grant still need to be negotiated with PG&amp;E. Officials at the U.S. Department of Energy say the money will be distributed over four years, from 2023 through 2026. The funds are designed to cover PG&amp;E's projected losses from keeping Diablo Canyon open longer, so if the company's operating costs come in lower than expected — or its power-sales revenues are higher than expected — it won't get quite as much federal money.Story continuesIf the plant fails to secure its federal license renewal — or any of the state permits it needs to keep operating — the funding spigot will be shut off.“This is a critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation’s largest source of clean electricity,” U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a written statement.U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm speaks at the shuttered San Onofre nuclear plant in San Diego County, flanked by Edison International CEO Pedro Pizarro, left, and Rep. Mike Levin. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) celebrated the announcement, saying in a written statement that the federal investment ""will allow Diablo Canyon to continue producing carbon-free energy until 2030, giving the state the time it needs to bring additional renewable energy sources online and eventually replace the energy produced by the nuclear plant.""Feinstein had previously supported PG&amp;E's plan to shutter Diablo in 2025. But she changed her mind this year, citing the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for round-the-clock sources of clean power to complement solar and wind.""This short-term extension is necessary if California is going to meet its ambitious clean-energy goals while continuing to deliver reliable power,"" Feinstein said Monday.Erich Pica, president of anti-nuclear environmental group Friends of the Earth, described that type of reaction to the federal funding as a ""premature victory lap."" He noted that several state agencies still need to sign off on the nuclear plant's continued operation, as spelled out in the legislation signed by Newsom.Pica suspects the governor is motivated at least in part by political aspirations. Although Newsom has insisted he won't run for president in 2024, speculation continues to swirl that he's preparing for a campaign. And the current plan for Diablo to begin shutting down in 2024 ""is very conspicuously aligned with when the Democratic presidential primary is going to be,"" Pica said.Newsom ""doesn't want to see any [electric grid] reliability issues come up while he’s contemplating his future political plans,"" Pica said. ""He's doing that at the cost of billions of dollars to California ratepayers in maintaining Diablo.""The future of nuclear power has become one of America's most contentious energy debates as the climate crisis worsens.Nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island stoked deep public fears about meltdowns and radioactive fallout, with the 2011 crisis at Japan's Fukushima plant hardening those sentiments for many.But worsening wildfires, heat waves, droughts and other climate extremes linked to the burning of fossil fuels — and growing awareness that nuclear plants currently produce half the nation's carbon-free electricity — have led some to reevaluate the merits of facilities like Diablo.A recent UC Berkeley poll co-sponsored by The Times found that 44% of California voters support building more nuclear reactors in the state, with 37% opposed and 19% undecided — a significant change from sentiment in the 1980s and 1990s. The poll found that 39% of voters oppose shutting down Diablo Canyon, 33% support closure and 28% are unsure.Another UC Berkeley poll conducted in September found even greater support for keeping the plant running through 2030.""I'm just happy that the tides have shifted,"" Poppe told The Times.The governor capitalized on those shifting tides, cajoling state lawmakers into approving a $1.4-billion loan designed to keep Diablo running through 2030. The vote came during an intense heat wave, which saw state officials beg Californians to use less power during the hot evening hours — when solar panels stop generating — for a record 10 straight days.The state managed to avoid rolling blackouts. But it was less lucky two years earlier when a few hundred thousand homes and businesses lost power briefly over two evenings during a brutal heat wave. There was another close call in 2021, when a wildfire temporarily knocked out several key power lines that bring hydropower from the Pacific Northwest to California.Continuing to operate Diablo Canyon is crucial for keeping the lights on while fighting climate change, supporters say. Dozens of scientists and academics have urged Newsom to keep the Diablo reactors spinning.""Some would say it’s the righteous and right climate decision,” Newsom told The Times' editorial board earlier this year.Gov. Gavin Newsom signs an executive order — on the hood of an electric vehicle — requiring all new passenger vehicles sold in California to be zero-emission by 2035. (Associated Press)The U.S. had 93 operating nuclear reactors last year, which generated nearly one-fifth of the nation's electricity. Those plants could go a long way toward meeting President Biden's goal of 100% climate-friendly electricity by 2035.But 13 reactors have shut down since 2013, often due to competition from lower-cost energy sources such as solar, wind and natural gas. In some cases, nuclear closures have led to more business for gas-fired power plants, causing climate pollution to rise.Atomic energy supporters say it's crucial to support power plants that can generate clean electricity around the clock — hence the $6 billion set aside by Congress to rescue economically distressed facilities such as Diablo Canyon.PG&amp;E was the only company to receive nuclear rescue dollars Monday. At least one company was denied funding. But more money could flow to ailing nuclear plants during a second round of funding planned by the Department of Energy.Critics see throwing money at dying nuclear plants as a dangerous, expensive solution.Ralph Cavanagh — a top official at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council and a key architect of the 2016 deal to shut down Diablo Canyon — says other clean energy technologies and strategies can keep air conditioners humming during heat waves. Rapid growth in lithium-ion batteries, for instance, played a key role in avoiding rolling blackouts this summer.Greater funding for batteries, energy efficiency and ""demand response"" programs — which pay people to use less electricity when the power grid is most stressed — could negate the need for continued reliance on nuclear power, he said.Cavanagh doesn't put much stock in recent public polling showing growing support for California's last nuclear plant. He noted that the most recent Berkeley poll was conducted just two weeks after the state narrowly avoided rolling blackouts.The real question, Cavanagh said, is whether state regulators determine that extending Diablo's life is the best solution.""The California public is now strongly in favor of anything it thinks might shore up reliability of the Western power grid,"" he said. ""But the fact is, we don’t have an infinite amount of money.""Anti-nuclear activists still hope to persuade federal officials to force Diablo Canyon's closure in 2025.Last week, four groups — San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace, Environmental Working Group, Committee to Bridge the Gap and Friends of the Earth — sent a letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission urging the agency to deny PG&amp;E's request to reopen a license renewal proceeding that was dropped in 2016. PG&amp;E should be required to submit a new application, they wrote.Granting the company's request would ""gravely undermine key aspects of the license renewal review process that are crucial for safety,"" the groups wrote.The potential for catastrophic meltdowns — however remote — isn't the only concern animating anti-nuclear activists. The federal government has failed to build a permanent storage facility for spent nuclear fuel, meaning radioactive waste canisters are piling up at power plants across the country — including the shuttered San Onofre plant in San Diego County.How do the risks and harms of nuclear power compare with fossil fuels? To Poppe, the answer is clear.""Given the significant impacts of climate change right here in California that we experience with the extreme weather, of course we would want to be able to provide the cleanest energy that is most reliable for the people of California,"" she said.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the Was Billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann's 3G Capital Right About These 5 Stocks?.We prepared the actual contents of this article in November 2021, when we analyzed the Q3 portfolio of billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann's 3G Capital to discuss the top 10 picks of 3G Capital at that time. We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong.In this article you will see the top 10 stock picks of billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann's 3G Capital as of the third quarter of last year.To assess the performance of these stocks and the hedge fund, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months.At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. It’d be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analysts’ price targets and calls.However, in 3G Capital's defense, we should add that the 2022 market crash crushed most of these stocks. That doesn't mean the hedge fund was entirely wrong in its approach. As many elite funds have long-term holding periods, it's quite possible that the fund would end up gaining from these investments in the coming months and years, especially as analysts believe the worst is behind us and the markets could actually begin to rebound in 2023.Before jumping to the actual stock picks of the fund, let's first see our brief primer on Jorge Paulo Lemann we wrote at the time of writing this article.Story continuesJorge Paulo Lemann co-founded 3G Capital in 2004, which is a global investment management firm with offices in New York City and Rio de Janeiro, pursuing long-term value via its strategic investments. 3G Capital has been involved in famous business combinations throughout the years, and the firm’s affiliate partners include Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) since 1989, and Lojas Americanas since 1983. In 2015, 3G Capital, in collaboration with Berkshire Hathaway, helped carry out the merger between H.J. Heinz Company and Kraft Foods Group, forming The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). Similarly, in 2014, 3G Capital completed the combination of Burger King and Tim Hortons, forming Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR). Jorge Paulo Lemann is a Brazilian billionaire investment banker, who completed his Bachelor’s from Harvard University, and his career has left a significant mark in the corporate governance field. Lemann has served as a board member and director of multiple companies throughout the years, including DaimlerChrysler, Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS), Swiss Reinsurance, The Gillette Company, and Lojas Americanas. Before establishing 3G Capital in 2004, Lemann was also the co-founder and partner of GP Investimentos, a Brazilian private equity firm. From 2013 till May 2021, he was a board member of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and currently, Lemann is a controlling shareholder of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD).Top 10 Stock Picks of Billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann's 3G Capital 10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)3G Capital’s Stake Value: $7,048,000Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -28%Billionaire Bill Gates’ Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted Q3 results on October 26. EPS in the period totaled $2.27, beating estimates by $0.19. The $45.32 billion revenue was up 21.97% from the previous-year quarter, topping estimates by $1.33 billion. According to Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has room for growth even after being one of the largest global companies. Alger mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Microsoft Corporation was among the top contributors to performance during the third quarter. Microsoft is a Positive Dynamic Change beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s enterprise cloud product, Azure, is rapidly growing and accruing market share. Microsoft reported that Azure grew 51% in the second quarter. This high unit volume growth is a primary driver of the company’s higher share price, but the company’s strong operating execution has enabled margin expansion that has also helped to increase forward earnings estimates. We believe Microsoft’s subscription-based software offerings and cloud computing services have a durable growth profile because they enhance customers’ growth initiatives and help them to diminish costs. Additionally, investors appreciate Microsoft’s strong free cash flow generation and its return of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”9. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)3G Capital’s Stake Value: $11,378,000Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -2.3%Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU), a Chinese tech company offering a digital wealth management and brokerage platform, is one of Lemann’s top stock picks from the third quarter. 3G Capital holds 125,000 shares in Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU), worth $11.37 million, representing 2.47% of the firm’s Q3 portfolio.Bocom analyst Jingyi Zhang on November 1 downgraded Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) to Neutral from Buy with a $53.30 price target.Here is what Tao Value has to say about Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Futu is a new “Opportunistic” position. It is an HK based online brokerage &amp; wealth management platform with deep roots in technology. Futu sits in the confluence of 3 strong favorable forces of Meteorology, Topography &amp; Commander, yet was underpriced at the time of our entry. In terms of Meteorology, there is a huge addressable market of Chinese domestic middle to upper classes’ wealth being deployed to overseas assets allocation in the next decade. Additionally, the incumbents being disrupted are extremely weak in their digital transformation. On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid &amp; reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing &amp; execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end &amp; UX) &amp; other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”8. Block (NYSE:SQ)3G Capital’s Stake Value: $21,586,000Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -70%UBS analyst Rayna Kumar initiated coverage of Block (NYSE:SQ), a California-based financial services and digital payments company, with a Buy rating and a $322 price target on November 17. The analyst expects the company to exceed short-term gross profit estimates, and according to Kumar, acquisition of the financial technology company, Afterpay Limited (OTC:AFTPY) will prove extremely beneficial for Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ). According to the database of elite hedge funds maintained by Insider Monkey, 98 funds were bullish on Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) as of Q3, with a total stake value of $8.88 billion. The leading stakeholder in the company is Catherine Wood’s ARK Investment Management, holding a $1.46 billion position in Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ). Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“We established a position in leading Financial Technology provider Square during the quarter. Through one integrated system, SQ is a hybrid of two businesses: its Seller Business (charging small and medium-sized businesses about 3% for transaction payment processing, plus other services such as instant funds access, and software for everything from customer engagement to payroll), and its Cash App (originally for person-to-person cash transfers and now a growing digital financial services provider for consumers).The combined business has grown gross profit at a 37% CAGR over the past five years to $2.7 billion (due to pass through costs, gross profit is more reflective of top-line growth) and we believe that the company has an enormous long-term runway, as it has less than a 2% share of a more than $160 billion market. It is our view that the company’s Cash App (which has grown from nothing in 2015 to $1.2 billion gross profit last year) has a particularly large opportunity with its powerful ecosystem of digital financial services including digital wallets, direct deposits, stock trading, bitcoin trading, and business and tax services, which are all relatively new. The vast majority of Cash App’s more than 36 million users are younger and, importantly, are willing to replace their bank and other financial services accounts with the app.We estimate that the company can grow its gross profit more than 30% and EBITDA more than 50% annually for the foreseeable future, and while most of the company’s current profit is from its Seller Business, we believe most of Square’s future value will be from its Cash App business.”7. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)3G Capital’s Stake Value: $24,194,000Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -60%Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is a company offering data storage and data analytics services by means of a cloud-based software. Lemann owns 80,000 Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) shares as of the third quarter, worth $24.1 million, accounting for 5.26% of his Q3 portfolio. Credit Suisse analyst Phil Winslow on November 16 initiated coverage of Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) with an Outperform rating and a $455 price target.Brad Gerstner’s Altimeter Capital Management is the leading stakeholder in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) as of September, with over 21 million shares worth $6.36 billion. Overall, 73 hedge funds were long Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), with the total stake value amounting to $14.56 billion. Here is what RiverPark Funds has to say about Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We also established a position in Snowflake during the quarter. Snowflake offers cloud-based data storage and analytics, generally termed “data warehouse-as-a-service.” The data warehousing market—created by the massive, growing amount of user, customer, and account data and the need to search and analyze it—has historically stored its data on physical servers located on-premises. The cloud data platform market—storing data off-premises on cloud servers—is a relatively new $70 billion+ market. Significantly, incremental warehouse data capacity and renewals are expected to be driven by and to the cloud, with more than 75% of databases in the cloud by 2022.Snowflake requires absolutely no infrastructure management from its users, is fully scalable for each customer, runs on Amazon, Microsoft, or Google cloud platforms, and most critically, Snowflake helps companies analyze their data. The company also has a unique, customer-aligned billing model based on usage. All of which has led to Snowflake being among the leaders of this highly fragmented market, posting 124% revenue growth last year. SNOW’s growth comes from the combination of more customers—which grew 73% last year—and customers buying more services—the company boasts an amazing 150%+ net customer retention. The company’s growing scale has also led to increasing gross margin and operating leverage, up 1,100 basis points and 8,200 basis points, respectively, over the past two years. The company has guided to FCF break-even this year, and with the company’s capital expenditure-light model—Snowflake uses the public cloud for hosting—we expect FCF to grow much faster than revenue growth, which we forecast to grow comfortably more than 50% per year for the next several years. Additionally, we have great confidence in the SNOW management team, which previously had an enormously successful run guiding one of our other core Cloud software holdings ServiceNow.”6. DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH)3G Capital’s Stake Value: $24,718,000Performance of the stock over the past 12 months as of November 22: -73%Jorge Paulo Lemann owns 120,000 shares in DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), an online food ordering and delivery platform, valued at $24.71 million, representing 5.37% of his Q3 portfolio. One of the leading DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) stakeholders as of September is Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management, with 9.45 million shares worth $1.94 billion. DoorDash, Inc.

Seeing growth in the region accelerate only encourages us to increase the size of our commitment.” Some of the best stocks in the Ken Griffin portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc.

The decision was largely cheered by Wall Street, with Disney's stock gaining more than 6% on Monday to cut its loss to 37% for the year to date.The move is effective immediately.During his first tenure from 2005 to 2020, Disney's annualised shareholder returns were more than 14%, well above its rival Comcast Corp and the broader stock market, and in total in that period the stock rose more than 400%.Yet analysts and some investors say that a returning CEO repeating their past success is not a given, and the decision to once again hand them the reins may be a sign that a company's culture is sputtering.""From a governance perspective it's a big red flag,"" said Brian Frank, whose Frank Funds has owned Disney on and off in the past and currently does not have a position in the company, viewing its valuation as too high. ""This is one of the highest- quality companies in the world with the best brands in the world but it shows to me that they're bad at succession planning.""Disney did not return a request for comment for this story.GAME-CHANGER OR DUD?Overall, the stock performance of companies led by CEOs who returned for another stint in their former position - so-called boomerang CEOs - was 10.1% lower during their tenures than companies led by chief executives who had not had the job before, according to a 2020 study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review by Christopher Bingham, Bradley Hendricks, Travis Howell, and Kalin Kolev.Chief among the factors for the poor performance of repeat CEOs were if the executive was a company founder, if they worked in a dynamic or fast-changing industry, and if the company had neglected succession planning, the study found.Story continuesShares of Xerox fell 60% in the year after Paul Allaire returned as CEO in 2000 as the company was unable to adapt to new digital technologies, the study found. Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble Co, meanwhile, rose about 3% during A.G. Lafley's two-year second stint as CEO, while the broad S&amp;P 500 index rose about 26% over the same time.Xerox declined comment and P&amp;G did not respond to a request for comment.Yet there are reasons to think that Disney may have made the right decision in bringing back Iger, Bingham said.""There might be more reason for optimism relative to some of these other boomerang CEOs as Iger was not the founder, was not gone for too long, and is coming back in with a plan to help succession,"" he said in an email to Reuters.Apple Inc's Steve Jobs is perhaps the best-case scenario of a chief executive returning to their previous company. Jobs famously resumed his position as CEO in 1997 when Apple was near collapse and remade it into the world's most valued company by the time he stepped down again in 2011.Howard Schultz, who built the Starbucks Corp franchise, was also successful in his second stint. Shares rose more than 1,000% in his tenure between 2008 and 2017.Starbucks did not comment on this story, but directed Reuters to its earnings results that topped expectations after Schultz’s third term as CEO.“I think this is a game-changer,"" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, about Disney. Link has owned the stock in the past and is bullish on the name. ""This reminds me very much of Starbucks 2.0 or 3.0 with Howard Schultz returning to Starbucks,” Link said. “I think the only thing is not great at is finding a successor.”While Wall Street is cheering Iger's return, Disney's long-term success will rest on whether he can successfully turn the company's streaming business profitable while managing the decline of its traditional television business and a likely slowdown in its parks division if the economy falls into a recession, said David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones.""Iger may have dodged a bullet because the time period when Chapek was CEO was not ideal with the pandemic shutdown of the parks and the shutdown of movie production,"" Heger said. ""But it's not an enviable position to come back in to because there are so many different challenges across the business and industry.""(Reporting by David Randall in New York Editing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis)]"

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Parker-Hannifin is:14% = US$1.3b ÷ US$8.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.14.Does Parker-Hannifin Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Parker-Hannifin has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Machinery industry average (13%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Parker-Hannifin by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesParker-Hannifin's Debt And Its 14% ROEParker-Hannifin does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.59. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Parker-Hannifin may not be the best stock to buy.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Parker-Hannifin and Nordson are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PH has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.07, while NDSN has a forward P/E of 23.47. We also note that PH has a PEG ratio of 1.36. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NDSN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.81.Another notable valuation metric for PH is its P/B ratio of 4.50. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: e.l.f. Beauty ELF, CECO Environmental CECO, CalMaine Foods CALM, Applied Industrial Technologies AIT and Archer Daniels Midland ADM.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street Tends to Rise in Thanksgiving Week: 5 Growth PicksIt's been a topsy-turvy ride for Wall Street of late, with investors keeping an eye on the Fed's policy moves and the latest earnings results. But the present Thanksgiving week should be bullish for the stock market.The broader S&amp;P 500, in reality, has advanced 0.54% on average during Thanksgiving week for the last 50 years compared with an average gain of just 0.16% in other weeks, per a yahoo finance article.The article further stated that during Thanksgiving week, the stock market struggled to gain direction on Mondays and Tuesdays. However, the stock market did gain considerably the day before Thanksgiving (Thursday) and the day after. After all, consumers splurge during the holiday season, which subsequently bodes well for the economy vis-à-vis the stock market.Talking about seasonal trends, the stock market tends to do well in the November to January period. Since 1936, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 4.5% in the said period, way more than the average three months gain of 2.9%, according to Bank of America's quantitative analysts, citing a MarketWatch article.Similarly, stocks tend to jack up after midterm elections. In 17 out of 19 midterms, since 1946, in the six months following an election, the stock market has given better returns compared to the six-month period leading up to it, as mentioned in a Schwab article. Americans already voted on Nov 8. Since then, till now, the S&amp;P 500 has gained around 5%.Story continuesBut it's not just seasonal trends, the stock market is expected to perform well on signs of inflation cooling down last month. Stubbornly high inflation for most of the year led the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, eventually squeezing consumer outlays, increasing borrowing costs, and impacting economic growth. However, the consumer price index rose 7.7% year over year in October, less than September's annual rise of 8.2%, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Additionally, the producer price index rose 8% last month compared to September's year-over-year increase of 8.4%, indicating that inflation is waning, and that may compel the Fed to take a less aggressive monetary policy stance.Banking on such positive trends, investors should place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks. We have highlighted five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

80,d5f8d7d9-10b6-3f43-94a6-d0460b6b6db1,ADM,2022-11-23,Buy These 5 Corporate Giants Flying High in Disappointing 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-corporate-giants-flying-130601542.html,1669122361,STORY,['ADM'],"[Less than six weeks of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September’s data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Year over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.Story continuesAs peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Zacks Rank #1 Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.Zacks Rank #2 McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of XOM has jumped 81.3% year to date.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MRK has advanced 37.8% year to date.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Leggett &amp; Platt is:23% = US$363m ÷ US$1.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.Does Leggett &amp; Platt Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Leggett &amp; Platt has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Consumer Durables industry average (23%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesLeggett &amp; Platt's Debt And Its 23% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Leggett &amp; Platt, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.37. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

93,1368ea17-158c-3313-bc2e-16568a368bd3,PKG,2022-11-23,Packaging Corporation of America's (NYSE:PKG) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 98% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/packaging-corporation-americas-nyse-pkg-154810803.html,1669132090,STORY,['PKG'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America Is Packaging Corporation of America Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$784.9mUS$951.5mUS$1.00bUS$1.05bUS$1.09bUS$1.12bUS$1.16bUS$1.19bUS$1.21bUS$1.24bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x2Est @ 5.55%Est @ 4.48%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.4%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$739US$843US$837US$824US$804US$781US$756US$730US$704US$677(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.7bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$16bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$131, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Packaging Corporation of America as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.831. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Packaging Corporation of America, there are three pertinent factors you should further research:Risks: Take risks, for example - Packaging Corporation of America has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does PKG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Reddit Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore.Reddit, an online platform, caught the attention of investors last year with the infamous short squeeze of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). In January 2021, shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) began skyrocketing, with traders from Reddit's WallStreetBets forum leading the onslaught. The rally sent the stock up 1600% before it fell down to regular levels again. While the rally itself was short-lived, it left a significant mark on Wall Street, with elite hedge funds like Melvin Capital being gutted to the point it had to be bailed out by two other firms. And even though the online traders did not overthrow traditional investing strategies as a whole, they still managed to put Reddit and its investors on the map of the investing world.Since then, meme stocks and Reddit stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have become an area of interest for investors and hedge funds alike. Traditional and institutional investors began realizing that they could benefit from Reddit stocks as well. Mudrick Capital Management, an investment advising company, initially benefitted tremendously from a Reddit-driven rally in AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) in July 2021. According to an article published by Bloomberg at that time, Mudrick bought up the company's bonds, providing $100 million in financing in exchange for about 22 million shares. These shares surged by as much as 839%, allowing Mudrick to profit significantly.According to an article published by the Wall Street Journal in August 2021, institutions like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs began tracking retail trading trends last year because of amateur investors dominating the markets at the time. This year as well, investors and hedge funds are keeping an eye on retail investors and their moves in the market to be able to monitor an unpredictable market to the best of their ability.Story continuesPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 Reddit stocks that are too cheap to ignore.Our MethodologyWe have selected stocks that have been trending on Reddit throughout 2022, ensuring that their share prices are mostly under the $30 mark.

Iger, popularly known as Bob Iger, as CEO, effective immediately.Bob Iger replaces Bob Chapek, following the latter’s two-year stint. The reappointment of Bob Iger as the CEO has bought a spree of excitement among investors as share prices have been surging ever since the news broke out on Nov 20 Shares jumped 6.3% to close at $97.58 on Nov 21.The lingering impact of the COVID, raging inflation and rising interest rates do not bode well for Disney’s consumer-oriented businesses. Shares have declined more than 37% year-to-date.Disney has been struggling in its streaming division with the increased cost of production and delayed releases lately.However, with Bob Iger taking charge once again, investors are expected to gain back their lost confidence in the company’s prospects.Bob Iger had actively been involved in launching the launch of Disney+ in 2019. His expertise and experience of more than four decades are likely to help the company create an efficient and cost-effective structure for the streaming platform.Where is Disney’s Streaming Division Heading To?Disney has been heavily investing in its streaming services to launch new movies and shows to gain traction. This has aided subscriber growth as Disney+ added more than 12 million global subscribers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.However, Disney’s direct-to-consumer division reported an operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, that doubled year-over-year. This has been attributed to macroeconomic factors like inflation, which have spiked up the cost of production for the company, as well as adverse foreign exchange impact that decreased Disney+’s ARPU by 5%.The Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteDisney+ also faces significant competition from Netflix NFLX, which has a strong pipeline of content and has reached 223 million subscribers worldwide to date. A saturated streaming market with the presence of services from the likes of Apple AAPL and Comcast CMCSA is creating headwind for Disney+.Streaming market leader, Netflix, reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 subscriber numbers. The streaming giant gained 2.41 million paid subscribers globally, higher than its estimate of gaining one million users. Netflix added 4.38 million paid subscribers in the year-ago quarter.Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+, continues to gain recognition with its critically acclaimed and popular shows like Ted Lasso.Comcast’s Peacock had more than 15 million paid subscribers in the United States at the end of third-quarter 2022. Moreover, Peacock had approximately 14 million bundled and free users, totaling around 30 million monthly active accounts.Nevertheless, Disney is focusing on the realignment of cost, including meaningful rationalization of marketing spending and optimization of content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement.The company expects Disney+ to reach profitability by 2024. It is also counting on releases such as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Avatar: The Way of Water to fuel its subscriber acquisition.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also about to launch a cheaper, ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+ to attract even more viewers and diversify its revenue stream. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The ad-supported version will launch on Dec 8 for $7.99 a month, while its basic ad-free subscription jumps to $10.99.ESPN+, the sports streaming platform of Disney, has also been taking steps to boost its top line.It renewed the Major League Baseball sports rights deal through 2028 and entered a long-term partnership with the National Football League, where it has agreed on a five-year rights deal with the NFL to broadcast the league’s Monday night Wild Card playoff game through the 2025 season.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Net income was $17 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.26. Comparable store sales for Q3 decreased 17%.More from Footwear NewsEarnings Wrap: Burlington Stores, Caleres &amp; Dick's Sporting Goods Report Latest Results + MoreTourist Dollars &amp; Designer Shoes Catapulted Ross Stores Stock in Q3 -- And Consumers Can Expect Lots of Deals This Holiday SeasonMacy's Shares Rise After Better-Than-Expected Q3 EarningsThe weaker than expected results came during what has been a generally strong quarter for other off-price companies. TJX Companies, which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, topped profit estimates in the third quarter. Ross Stores Inc. last week raised its guidance given its third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments. Experts previously told FN that the off-price sector was poised to have a strong holiday season, thanks to unusually high inventories across retail and a surge of deal-hungry consumers.This juxtaposition was not lost on Burlington CEO Michael O’Sullivan, who described Burlington’s results this year as “disappointing” and the company as an “outlier within off-price.”“As an off-price retailer, we should be able to drive stronger performance than this,” he said in a Tuesday call with investors.O’Sullivan said a pullback on higher pricing and more aggressive markdowns to clear through slow-moving products in Q3 contributed to the weaker sales and profits. To lift sales, Burlington increased its assortment of recognizable key brands and sold some reserve inventory for Q4 during Q3 instead. According to O’Sullivan, these measures should have been implemented earlier.“We should have responded more aggressively and more rapidly,” he said.O’Sullivan also noted Burlington’s high exposure to lower-income consumers, who have born the brunt of inflation’s impact. He also noted Burlington’s transition to carry more off-price goods, which has involved key investments in its buying capabilities over the last few years.Story continuesMoving forward, the company reaffirmed its conservative 2022 outlook but expressed optimism for trends to pick up in 2023, as the economy slows and consumers ramp up their focus on value. A slowdown in promotional trends across full-price retail could also bolster off price players like Burlington, who rely on selling goods for less than regular retailers.To drive growth, a focus on picking up sales is crucial, O’Sullivan said.“We have to drive sales,” he said. “The only way to do that in our business is to continue to improve our ability to deliver value to the customer. I realize 2022 has not been a good advertisement for our ability to do that, but we’ll learn from the mistakes that we’ve made this year.”]"

106,fc9523cc-bb7f-3ac8-843c-7249c36ec62b,NRG,2022-11-23,What Makes NRG (NRG) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-nrg-nrg-buy-stock-170005004.html,1669136405,STORY,['NRG'],"[NRG Energy (NRG) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for NRG basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for NRG imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for NRGThis power company is expected to earn $11.57 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 50.9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for NRG. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 22.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of NRG to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After all, who doesn’t love the thrill of getting paid?In a highly-volatile 2022, dividends have been a precious item for investors, helping to cushion the impact of drawdowns in other positions.And when seeking dividend-paying stocks, many turn to the Dividend Aristocrats.Dividend Aristocrats have consistently paid and increased their dividends for a minimum of 25 consecutive years, putting their well-established and successful business natures on full display.Three rookies that have just recently joined the club – International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Caterpillar CAT, and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE – could all be considerations for investors seeking income.The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.International Business MachinesInternational Business Machines is an information technology (IT) company operating through five segments: software, consulting, infrastructure, financing, and others. 2022 marked the 27th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend.IBM’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 4.5% paired with a payout ratio of 74% of its earnings. As we can see in the chart below, the company’s yield easily outmatches its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has consistently impressed with its quarterly results as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in three consecutive quarters.Just in its latest release, IBM posted a 1.7% EPS beat paired with a 2.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillarCaterpillar is the world’s largest construction-equipment manufacturer. The company designs, develops, engineers, manufactures, markets, and sells machinery, engines, financial products, and insurance to customers. 2022 marked the company’s 29th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts.Story continuesCAT’s annual dividend currently yields 2.1% paired with a solid 9% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.The company’s payout ratio sits at a sustainable 38% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company’s earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNextEra EnergyNextEra Energy is a public utility holding company engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. The company has upped its dividend payout for 28 consecutive years.NEE’s annual dividend currently comes in at 2%, below that of the Zacks Utilities sector by a fair margin. Still, the company’s 11.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, NEE’s growth profile is hard to ignore; earnings are forecasted to climb more than 13% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and an additional 8.3% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 19.5% and 30% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, NEE shares have been notably strong over the last five years, up more than 140% and easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhen structuring a portfolio, many investors blend in dividend-paying stocks for obvious reasons, including limiting drawdowns in other positions, creating a passive income stream, and the ability to maximize return through dividend reinvestment.And when it comes to dividend-paying stocks, Dividend Aristocrats are common targets, as they’ve upped their dividend payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years.All three stocks above – International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Caterpillar CAT, and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE – belong to the elite Dividend Aristocrat group, making them suitable considerations for investors seeking income.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""As governments, civil society and multilateral institutions adapt to what appears to be a new era of uncertainty and instability, so too will businesses and markets navigate sanctions, increased protectionism, government interventions, alternative payment systems and reputational risk.""S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence identifies the key five defining geopolitical and global macroeconomic themes:A number of unresolved conflicts, including Russia-Ukraine, will be sources of persistent risk in 2023, filtering into the global economic outlook. The invasion of Ukraine has hastened a confrontation with a host of global security risks to be wrestled with in 2023. Economic and security spheres will become increasingly interdependent in 2023 and beyond, as countries use financial levers including tariffs, export restrictions, and sanctions to advance national security priorities.With energy security back atop the agenda following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, countries will be balancing 2023 fiscal priorities against a new impetus to accelerate their energy transitions. In the year ahead, energy security will remain at the top of the agenda, leaving countries to balance pressing resource priorities, such as food and energy, with their energy transition ambitions.An expected easing in supply chain disruptions in the first half of 2023 remains vulnerable to labor and resource shortages including critical technologies and critical minerals. As the acute shock of the COVID-19 virus pandemic recedes, and amid cost-of-living and recessionary worries, we expect relative easing in supply chain disruptions into the first half of 2023.Labor markets are in transition as demand overruns supply, tilting power and income shares towards workers across major markets. Labor-market tightness across major markets is expected to persist but ease slightly where recessions take hold in 2023, with any slowing in wage growth to be limited.The risk environment will continue to underpin the economic outlook for 2023. Recessions now appear likely in Europe and North America, while Asia Pacific (APAC) and other emerging markets are likely to skirt recession.Story continuesTo request a copy of the A World Rebalancing report, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence At S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

""However, we also continue to monitor for signals of faster-than-expected growth in inventory. Currently, there are no clear signs; inventories have advanced as anticipated. But any indication of faster than projected growth in the overall stock of new vehicles could mean that auto consumers are feeling the pressure of the current economic headwinds and retreating from the market.""As a result, October's SAAR boost is likely to be an anomaly compared to the remainder of the year, Hopson said, adding that there are expectations of volatility in the monthly results starting in early 2023.Story continuesMarket share of battery-electric vehicles is expected to reach 5.9% in November. However, outside of the large coastal cities, retail registrations of EVs have yet to take hold, according to analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility.The top-eight EV markets in the US are all in coastal states and represent 50.5% of total EV registrations so far in 2022 (through August). The greater Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas alone account for nearly one-third of total share of the US EV market. Meanwhile the Heartland states' market share of EV sales is barely half of what they contribute to overall vehicle registrations.""BEV market share control on the two coasts is attributed to their higher mix of early adopters compared to buyers in middle America,"" said Tom Libby, associate director of Loyalty Solutions and Industry Analysis at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Their demographic profile is more in sync with the traditional BEV buyer than the middle-American profile.""But Libby sees potential for EV acceptance in top heartland markets: ""More acceptance and much broader consumer awareness is resulting in a natural progression of adoption from the coasts to the Heartland."" (For more on this analysis of EVs in the Heartland, please see this special report.)Supporting the EV advancement, product reveals surrounding the Los Angeles Auto Show last week continue to reflect the OEM focus.According to Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence at S&amp;P Global Mobility, ""As auto shows at their best highlight what people will be driving in coming years, the reveals during the  Los Angeles Auto Show reflect the continuing push toward electric and electrified vehicles.""Of note, Fiat announced it will bring a version of the European 500 EV to the U.S. starting in early 2024, reviving the 500e nameplate. Toyota's reveal of the 2023 Prius hybrid included a Prime trim that will double the hatchback's EV-only range, while the automaker also showed a rendering of the bZ (""Beyond Zero"") electric-vehicle concept, previewing a forthcoming compact SUV.

The firm also noted food retailers including Aldi, Lidl, BJ's, Walmart and Kroger have announced Thanksgiving promotions, with Aldi slashing up to 30% of prices to return costs to 2019 levels, while Lidl is offering a $30 10-person meal promotion.Story continuesAdditionally, with inflation in the ""Food at Home"" component of the government's broader measure of consumer prices higher than the ""Food Away from Home"" category, some Americans this year may also turn to dining out this Thanksgiving rather than gathering at home, which is traditionally more commonplace for this holiday.Based on the government's Consumer Price Index for September and October, the rate of inflation for food at home outpaced dining out during both months. Bank of America noted the relative cost of eating out this year is more favorable this year, something that has occurred in only four of the last 28 years.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

With private networks, 5G can deliver these benefits with ultra-high capacity and low latency for numerous industrial sensors, actuators, and controllers in standard and safety control applications, both in mmWave and conventional sub-6GHz spectrum. 5G offers the promise of being a viable technology to augment, and even replace, traditional wired industrial network connections - a game changer in terms of cost, flexibility, reconfigurability, sustainability, and time-to-market for industrial operations around the world.The manufacturing industry needs to be flexible to ever-changing market demands. For example, they needed to retool their industrial operations to meet shifting demand during the pandemic: switching from soda to sanitizer, clothing to medical masks, or automotive parts to ventilators. The lesson is that agility, efficiency, resiliency, and sustainability are important aspects of smart manufacturing.Industrial Private 5G is an enabler of digital transformation in smart manufacturing to help deliver business outcomes, such as sustainability and agility by supporting key application use cases:Connected worker applications increase visibility and intelligence through mobile digital tools, such as analytics, digital twins, and augmented reality (AR).Mobile asset applications increase agility and efficiency with autonomous vehicles, such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMR).Untethered fixed industrial asset applications improve sustainability by reducing the need for wired infrastructure to connect static equipment, static equipment with rotating parts (slip-ring replacement) and nomadic equipment (operational while static, non-operational while mobile). Untethered fixed industrial assets also increase agility by reducing the time to retool industrial operations to respond to changing market conditions.Story continuesCan industrial Private 5G help to enable these application uses cases within manufacturing and process operations? To address this question, Rockwell Automation (industry leader in industrial automation) collaborated with Ericsson (industry leader in cellular networking infrastructure), Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (industry leader in 5G technology), and Verizon (leading network service provider). The research collaboration evaluated industrial Private 5G technology with EtherNet/IP™ connectivity, the core industrial communications technology from Rockwell Automation. The key learning objective was to ensure that EtherNet/IP networks are ready for industrial Private 5G, and to confirm that industrial Private 5G is ready for demanding EtherNet/IP applications.The illustration above, is a simplified representation of the testbed developed, illustrating an untethered fixed industrial asset application use case, consisting of:Rockwell Automation standard and safety control. One area controller with a GuardLogix® safety controller. Twelve distributed areas with FLEX 5000® standard and safety I/O, representing skids, machines or equipment. Note, the purpose of the safety controller in each distributed area was to collect testbed telemetry data only.Ericsson radio access network (RAN) infrastructure. Composed of a mmWave base station using 28 GHz (n261) and LTE band 2 using Release 15, and Private 5G core (3GPP Release-15, non-standalone (NSA), on-premise).Qualcomm Mobile Test Platform (MTP). A mobile test platform for data collection and traffic flow analysis, used as an industrial 5G to Ethernet adapter, referred to as user equipment (UE).Verizon's thought leadership in industrial networking innovation with 5G was an important contribution towards defining requirements, target feature sets and scope of the testbed, including a roadmap of future validation requirements.Tests were run according to a well-established test plan provided by Rockwell Automation with strict success criteria of zero faults. It outlined a series of test cases to establish reliable EtherNet/IP standard and safety (CIP Safety™) I/O connections from the GuardLogix area controller on the left, with a range of requested packet interval (RPI) settings, over the 5G RAN to the FLEX 5000 standard and safety I/O in areas 1 through 12 on the right. RPI is the rate at which the controller and the I/O exchange data.The successful test results demonstrated that the current state of industrial Private 5G (3GPP Release-15, NSA, on-premise, mmWave spectrum) has low enough latency and jitter to support RPI settings that are better than the Rockwell Automation default settings for EtherNet/IP standard and safety I/O connections. These RPI settings will support many untethered fixed industrial asset applications (skids, machines, or equipment) that use EtherNet/IP standard and safety I/O communications.The outcomes of the learning objective emphasized:EtherNet/IP is ready for industrial Private 5G.The current state of industrial Private 5G is ready for EtherNet/IP standard and safety I/O applications.Industrial Private 5G can help to enable business outcomes such as increased sustainability and improved agility within industrial operations.The research collaboration will continue, with plans to evaluate EtherNet/IP time synchronization (CIP Sync™) and distributed motion (CIP Motion™) applications over 3GPP Release 16 standalone (SA) industrial Private 5G. The results of an initial proof-of-concept test were promising.In summary, thanks to the collaboration between Rockwell Automation, Ericsson, Qualcomm Technologies, and Verizon, we are able to verify that real 5G enabled industrial automation test cases work as promised. Industrial operations can thus take advantage of the 5G standard today to meet their high-performance wireless connectivity and business assurance needs as they evolve toward smart manufacturing.Qualcomm, Tuesday, November 22, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.qualcomm.com/company/sustainabilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727810/Heres-How-Industrial-Private-5G-Helps-Enable-Sustainable-and-Agile-Industrial-Operations]"

Imago is evaluating its lead pipeline candidate, bomedemstat (IMG-7289), an oral LSD1 inhibitor, in multiple mid-stage clinical studies for treating bone marrow diseases like essential thrombocythemia (ET), myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera (PV).Shares of Imago have surged 50.1% in the year against the industry’s 19.7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer the terms of the acquisition, Merck, through a subsidiary, will initiate a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding stock of Imago BioSciences. After the Merck subsidiary completes the tender offer, it will merge with IMGO. The transaction, expected to be completed by first-quarter 2023, is also subject to customary closing conditions and clearance from the regulatory authorities.Imago currently lacks a steady stream of revenues due to a lack of approved drugs. An acquisition by a big pharma giant like Merck, which has high reserves of cash flow, would allow the company to advance the development of its pipeline. Once the pipeline candidates are approved for marketing, Imago will have access to Merck’s larger and well-established commercial supply chain and network distribution.Once the acquisition is completed, Merck will add bomedemstat to its pipeline. Merck believes adding of an LSD1 inhibitor like bomedemstat, which offers a new mechanism for treating blood cancers, will enable it to strengthen its hematology pipeline.Imago BioSciences, Inc.

Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September’s data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Year over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.Story continuesAs peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Zacks Rank #1 Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.Zacks Rank #2 McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of XOM has jumped 81.3% year to date.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MRK has advanced 37.8% year to date.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

139,da68f91b-6289-3a6d-a560-75f11464b67d,SO,2022-11-23,Southern Company The (SO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-company-trending-stock-facts-140002413.html,1669125602,STORY,['SO'],"[Southern Co. (SO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this power company have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, which Southern Co. falls in, has gained 8.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Southern Co. is expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share, indicating a change of -33.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.77 indicates a change of +4.7% from what Southern Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Southern Co.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Southern Co. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.07 billion and $28.22 billion estimates indicate +17.1% and +4.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySouthern Co. reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24.08%. The EPS surprise was -1.5%.Over the last four quarters, Southern Co. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Southern Co. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Southern Co. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new facility is anticipated to be commissioned in 2023.Benefits of the ExpansionThe company had set foot in Huntsville six years back with its Defense Headquarters. Since it began its operations in the region, the company has grown its employee base in the area by more than 700%, thus exemplifying strong work base strength to meet the growing demand.With an already manufacturing unit in Huntsville, the new giant facility solidifies Aerojet Rocketdyne’s position in the region. Moreover, the recent expansion plan could be prudent as the location boasts engineering expertise strength, which will assist in meeting the nation’s defense production needs.Also, the facility is strategically located in proximity to its government and other allied customers. This may assist the company in winning multiple orders involving rocket and missile propulsion products.Such additions to the manufacturing capacity should boost the stock’s probable defense contracts, thereby bolstering its future revenues.Peer MovesThe defense landscape continuously evolves to meet the current warfare needs. Defense companies strive to provide innovative solutions and products to their customers to ensure a continuous inflow of orders from customers. Moreover, companies get into expansion strategies by building facilities to invest in new capabilities and ease their operations.Apart from AJRD, defense majors that have invested in expansion strategies are as follows:In July 2022, Northrop Grumman NOC announced the construction of a new 113,000-square-foot facility in West Virginia. The facility will increase the company’s capacity within the defense industrial base to ensure the delivery of current and future weapons to meet warfighter needs.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 2.9%. NOC shares have returned 45.4% in the past year.In October 2022, Lockheed Martin LMT announced the opening of a new All-Up Round III facility at Camden Operations in Arkansas.

(NYSE:NKE) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.34 on the 28th of December, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.3% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for NIKE NIKE's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, prior to this announcement, NIKE's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 37.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendNIKE Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.36 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.36. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.We Could See NIKE's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. NIKE has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.6% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.We Really Like NIKE's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 9.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.7%. This estimate has changed +6.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.78 indicates a change of +17.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.55 billion and $30.08 billion estimates indicate +8.6% and +9.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After all, who doesn’t love the thrill of getting paid?In a highly-volatile 2022, dividends have been a precious item for investors, helping to cushion the impact of drawdowns in other positions.And when seeking dividend-paying stocks, many turn to the Dividend Aristocrats.Dividend Aristocrats have consistently paid and increased their dividends for a minimum of 25 consecutive years, putting their well-established and successful business natures on full display.Three rookies that have just recently joined the club – International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Caterpillar CAT, and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE – could all be considerations for investors seeking income.The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.International Business MachinesInternational Business Machines is an information technology (IT) company operating through five segments: software, consulting, infrastructure, financing, and others. 2022 marked the 27th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend.IBM’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 4.5% paired with a payout ratio of 74% of its earnings. As we can see in the chart below, the company’s yield easily outmatches its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has consistently impressed with its quarterly results as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in three consecutive quarters.Just in its latest release, IBM posted a 1.7% EPS beat paired with a 2.7% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillarCaterpillar is the world’s largest construction-equipment manufacturer. The company designs, develops, engineers, manufactures, markets, and sells machinery, engines, financial products, and insurance to customers. 2022 marked the company’s 29th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts.Story continuesCAT’s annual dividend currently yields 2.1% paired with a solid 9% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.The company’s payout ratio sits at a sustainable 38% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company’s earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNextEra EnergyNextEra Energy is a public utility holding company engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. The company has upped its dividend payout for 28 consecutive years.NEE’s annual dividend currently comes in at 2%, below that of the Zacks Utilities sector by a fair margin. Still, the company’s 11.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, NEE’s growth profile is hard to ignore; earnings are forecasted to climb more than 13% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and an additional 8.3% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 19.5% and 30% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, NEE shares have been notably strong over the last five years, up more than 140% and easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhen structuring a portfolio, many investors blend in dividend-paying stocks for obvious reasons, including limiting drawdowns in other positions, creating a passive income stream, and the ability to maximize return through dividend reinvestment.And when it comes to dividend-paying stocks, Dividend Aristocrats are common targets, as they’ve upped their dividend payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years.All three stocks above – International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Caterpillar CAT, and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE – belong to the elite Dividend Aristocrat group, making them suitable considerations for investors seeking income.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

154,d0cbcd4c-aa5d-381e-bd8a-6edb99e0223d,IBM,2022-11-23,What Do You Really Own in the Ownership Economy?,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/really-own-ownership-economy-180700658.html,1669140420,STORY,['IBM'],"[The blockchain is the future. That’s what we’re told anyway. If you’ve heard of the blockchain, you’ve probably also heard its proponents talking about the utopian ideal of decentralized ownership.Decentralized ownership goes way beyond monkey jpegs: Some companies are predicting – and promising – ownership of everything from houses to television and media networks, all on the blockchain.While the future seems exciting, promises like these and the utopian picture many people paint bring me to one central question: What do you actually own in the ownership economy?The answer is more complicated than you might think.Nick Ducoff is a partner at G20 Ventures, a co-founder of ON_Discourse and a founding member of OurNextDAO.NFTsMany people assume owning a non-fungible token means you own the associated asset – in reality, all you can prove you own in many cases is the tokenID and contract address. The legal right to control the item may or may not be intrinsically part of the NFT.Copyright law introduces additional complexity: Transferring ownership does not inherently transfer copyright. U.S. copyright law has stringent requirements for transferring copyright, which are not guaranteed to be met by smart contracts.When purchasing an NFT, many people assume they’re buying the work it represents. The reality is a little more complex. In fact, when you purchase an NFT, what you actually own is the token’s metadata (including its tokenID and the contract address) – not necessarily the work itself.Furthermore, the token doesn’t actually reside in your wallet, but rather the token’s ledger is updated to reflect that your wallet owns one. This introduces a number of issues related to ownership and copyright.See also: What You Own When You Own an NFT | OpinionPhysical objects and ownershipSay you buy an NFT associated with a physical object. What you have definitely purchased is the tokenID and contract address connected to that physical item. Other assets, like the physical object itself and whether you have the legal right to control the item, may or may not be intrinsically part of the NFT.Story continuesBuying an NFT representing a physical object doesn’t guarantee that you will receive the goods. Purchasing the NFT doesn’t trigger a process wherein a robot fulfills and ships an order from a warehouse, for example. There’s a human in the loop.And if the order isn’t fulfilled, the blockchain remains immutable. You can’t get a chargeback as you could with a purchase you made using a credit card. You’re just SOL (no pun intended).Copyright confusionIt gets even more complicated when the NFT is connected to a digital creative work, in part because of rampant confusion about the relationship between NFTs and copyright law – and specifically U.S. copyright law, which sets a high bar for selling copyright.If you purchase an NFT of a digital creative work – let’s say a piece of visual art that someone else created – you have, once again, definitely purchased the tokenID and contract address for the artwork. What’s murkier is figuring out who has the ability to create (and profit from) derivatives or copies of that art.Part of the confusion comes from the fact that, under U.S. copyright law, there is a difference between transferring a copy of something (like a piece of art) and transferring copyright (as in, the right to make other copies of that art). Transferring copyright requires that the transfer occurs in writing, with a signature from the copyright owner – something smart contracts can make surprisingly difficult.Let’s say, as an example, that Person A creates a piece of digital art. Person B buys an NFT, acquiring full ownership of the copyright as part of the original contract. At some point, Person B decides to sell the NFT.What happens when Person C buys it? Does copyright automatically transfer to them? Not necessarily! If the smart contract does not specifically include mention of copyright transfer, Person B might still legally hold the copyright – even if Person C now has the NFT.And what happens if Person B created a ton of derivative material around their NFT before they sold it? Do those revenue streams go with the NFT to Person C, or do they remain with Person B, the copyright holder?There’s no crystal clear answer to those questions, and yet the legal and financial ramifications of those answers are significant.Read more: The End of the 'Centralization Era' in Crypto | OpinionLegal ramificationsThe promise of NFTs is that of a form of true digital ownership entirely counter to the current model of licensing and streaming (in which buying something like a song, book, or movie online does not mean you truly own that digital item, much less its copyright).However, the legal landscape of copyright and ownership – especially where digital assets are concerned – has not yet adjusted to NFTs and other Web3-related assets. Nor do all NFT sellers seem to fully abide by the ethos of true digital ownership.One article on NFTs and digital property in the Indiana Law Journal notes that while Axie Infinity, for example, sells “axies … on the grounds that they are owned and may be resold for profit,” Axie’s actual license asserts that the company still has copyright control. As the author points out, the inconsistencies between what buyers are told and what’s in the licensing agreement make for an unstable market and legal environment. The legal issues here are complex and thorny.Vanishingly few existing NFT projects have been released with explicit copyright terms baked into the smart contract and, as in the case of Axie, there can be conflicts between what the buyer thinks they’re getting and the licensing terms. The potential for expensive, complicated legal issues down the line is real, and it’s likely that many such cases will be litigated in court in the coming years.What this means in a practical sense now is that when you purchase an NFT, it’s entirely possible that the only things you actually own are the tokenID and contract address. Everything else, unless explicitly spelled out, is very much a gray area.Governance tokensA governance token makes you a decision-maker – but does it make you an owner of that organization? It’s unclear how governance tokens define the relationship of rights and accountability between token holders and organizations. Governance tokens might be considered securities or equity, but that definition remains murky for many token holders.Bad actors can manipulate governance tokens and technical loopholes to cause significant financial damage.When you receive a governance token, you also gain the right to vote on governance questions – holding the token makes you a decision-maker within the organization that issued it. But does it make you an owner?In a more typical corporate organization, if you purchased shares of a company in the form of securities or were issued them as stock options, you might be considered a shareholder, depending on the organization’s structure and your connection to it.Shareholders have certain rights based on state law and common law from years of court precedent, especially in Delaware. While governance tokens are not equity in a literal sense, they are often regarded as being similar to more traditionally understood forms of equity.However, in the Web3 space, there are no widespread, commonly agreed upon mechanisms for holding people accountable the way there are in a company with shareholders, a board of directors and management teams.Much of the excitement about Web3 is about doing away with unnecessary hierarchy – but in this case, what’s important isn’t that hierarchy. It’s the relationship between ownership (like stock) and accountability.See also: The Pitfalls of 'Community-as-Company' | OpinionShares vs. governance tokensTo take just one example, let’s say you own one IBM share. That means you own one share’s worth of IBM and are a shareholder (and likely a shareholder who expects the value to increase).The more shares you own, the more weight your voice will carry when it comes time for IBM to make decisions. Also, you get one share of dividends. There are also systems in place to ensure IBM’s actions are held accountable to its shareholders.However, if what you own is a governance token, there are no such guarantees of accountability, no clear indication of whether you can expect your token to be exchangeable for value, and no well-defined sense of what holding that token really means.This leads to another set of questions, the answers to which are often equally unclear, such as:Is a governance token a security?Is it a claim on the treasury?What liquidity is available, and what will continue to be available?Does owning a token confer governance of the specific product/project, the whole organization or both?What happens if the organization is “wrapped” – that is, if there’s an LLC or corporate structure on top?Is a governance token transferable?Market manipulationQuestions about governance tokens and what you own are already complex, and the fun doesn’t stop there. It’s also possible for bad actors to manipulate governance tokens and decentralized structures in incredibly harmful ways.Mango Markets, for example, experienced a painful market manipulation. Exploiters found loopholes in the smart contract that allowed them to dramatically increase the value of their collateral and siphon money from the Mango Markets treasury in the form of loans – to the tune of more than $100 million.Not only that, but one of the exploiters went on to offer to settle bad debt using the stolen funds and used stolen tokens to vote for their own proposal.While they lacked sufficient tokens to pass the proposal, this type of market manipulation and exploitation makes it imperative to answer questions about what you truly own when you own a governance token.So, what do you own?As you think through these issues – and these are just a handful of examples from an increasingly complex landscape – you might find yourself wondering whether the ownership economy is actually a mirage.What do you actually own? In too many cases, there is no clear answer to this question, and there’s plenty of ambiguity when answers do exist.The ownership economy is not currently what it’s made out to be. Rather than a utopia of decentralized ownership, we see increasingly complex legal questions with increasingly high financial stakes.ReversibilityFortunately, there are ways we can start addressing that complexity. Reversibility, for example, is something to consider.Right now, the market has a major caveat emptor hanging over it – and while buyers should be aware of what they’re purchasing, too few have real access to the information they need. Although the blockchain’s immutability is one of its selling points, there are proposals for reversibility that work with the blockchain while offering recourse to consumers.One such proposal focuses on ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, and suggests a short reversal dispute period during which decentralized panels of judges determine whether or not a transaction should be reversed.Information disclosureAnother element to think about is ensuring more information is available for buyers. It should be possible to list information in the transaction to spell out exactly what it is you’re getting when you make a purchase. Easy access to the rights and licensing information associated with a token, for example, will help buyers understand exactly what their token enables them to do.The ownership economy is a promising space. But right now, those promises are not being fulfilled. Legal and market realities are clashing and high-profile scandals are drawing attention to shortcomings in the system. What’s presented as utopia looks more like a pipe dream, if the headlines are anything to go by.However, it’s not too late to get closer to that utopian ideal. It will take work, and likely quite a lot of legal wrangling, but there are opportunities to ensure everyone who enters the ownership economy knows exactly what they own.]"

Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September’s data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Year over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.Story continuesAs peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Zacks Rank #1 Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.Zacks Rank #2 McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of XOM has jumped 81.3% year to date.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MRK has advanced 37.8% year to date.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

""(2) Though our latest model update leads us to reduce [near term] EPS estimates, we still find ourselves slightly above consensus for Q4-2024E EPS.

Tesla stock was up 1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley echoed Michaeli's sentiment, which comes amid ongoing concerns about CEO Elon Musk being distracted by running Twitter.“There must be some form of sentiment ‘circuit breaker’ around the Twitter situation to calm investor concerns around Tesla,” Jonas wrote in a new note.In the past month alone, Tesla's stock has shed 20% — compared to a 6.6% rally in the S&amp;P 500.""This is a very nervous few months ahead for Tesla investors as they remain the ones that have been punched again and again by the Musk Twitter antics and the stock now is deep in the investor penalty box until deliveries hit in early January and we get a better sense of the 2023 delivery/production trajectory,"" warned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.Story continuesIves — a long-time Tesla bull — removed the stock from the Wedbush best ideas list earlier this month.A modified Tesla Model X drives into the tunnel entrance before an unveiling event for the Boring Co.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Marathon Refining MPC, Stellantis STLA and RWE AG RWEOY.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:The World Cup: Global Week AheadIn this Global Week Ahead, the most important day for U.S. retailers is here.Shopper's Black Friday comes after Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving Day.In currency markets, questions are rife on whether ""king dollar"" is set to decline, finally.In terms of macro data events, global purchasing managers data (PMIs) will shine a light on the health of key actors in the world economy.As for monetary policy? On Monday, Mainland China's PBoC could step up some of its promised support.Finally, the World Cup soccer tournament kicks off in Qatar.Next are Reuter's five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) On Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) Offers Monetary Policy Steps. The Chinese central bank's pledge to step up supportive policy measures should be on display on Monday, when key loan prime rates are set.Stocks and industrial metal markets are cheering signs of pro-growth initiatives, from help for the beleaguered property market to, crucially, an easing of choking zero-COVID policies.The COVID outlook remains murky. Noises from Beijing are that ""life-saving"" measures are essential, which argues against making too much of a two-day reduction in quarantine times.Other regional central banks will also be setting rates.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is tipped for a super-sized 75 basis point hike on Wednesday, while the Bank of Korea is seen tightening again, but possibly only by a quarter of a point.Story continues(2) The IMF says the Global Economy is in Poor Shape. PMIs for NOV come out. The International Monetary Fund says the global economic outlook is even gloomier than it was a month ago.Is the pessimism justified?Preliminary readings of business activity in November from a number of economies could answer the question in the coming days.Manufacturing PMIs for October pointed to a deepening contraction in global industry, with developed markets leading the decline.In most European countries, PMIs are below the 50 marker that separates expansion from contraction -- France was an exception.Britain is already facing a lengthy recession. Euro zone economic growth has held up better than expected and labor markets remain relatively robust.But the risk of recession is still elevated for a region grappling with an energy shock and higher costs for anything from financing to wages.(3) Has the Huge U.S. Dollar Move in 2022 Topped? The rise of the U.S. dollar has been the dominant trading theme of 2022, thanks to the Federal Reserve's quest to raise interest rates to quell inflation, giving the currency an edge over its peers among investors, who have been starved of any kind of yield for at least a decade.October's inflation report delivered evidence that consumer price pressures have slowed for the past four straight months from June's 41-year peak of 9.1%.The dollar index, meanwhile, peaked at a 20-year high of 114.78 in September and has been falling ever since.Now, it's heading for its biggest quarterly loss since the second quarter of 2017, having shed 4.5% in value.The time may be fast approaching for dollar bears to emerge from hibernation.(4) ""Black Friday"" is Here on Nov. 25th.With concerns that the U.S. economy may be on the verge of a recession, a key test of consumer demand arrives on Nov. 25, when retailers launch ""Black Friday"" sales - a day traditionally marked by long lines of shoppers eager to pounce on discounts.Soaring inflation and surging interest rates could test buying appetite.October U.S. retail sales increased more than expected, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, suggesting the consumer may be on more solid footing heading into year-end. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.Retailers have offered mixed results in the most recent earnings season. Just this week, Walmart lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices, while Target forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.(5) The Soccer World Cup Gets Underway in Qatar. The football World Cup is finally kicking off on Sunday - an event marred by controversy since Qatar was awarded hosting rights 12 years ago, including allegations of corruption and human rights violations.Qatar has much riding on the tournament passing off smoothly - hoping to affirm Doha's place on the global stage and for an economic boost.Higher consumption, government spending and services exports are all positives for the Gulf state that has seen its growth outlook trail some of its peers in a region buffeted by high crude prices.But it remains to be seen how long these effects might last, according to analysts.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks  Here are three Zacks #1 Ranked stocks that also show nice Zacks VGM scores.(1) Marathon Refining: This is a $120 a share Oil and Gas Refining and Marketing company, with a market cap of $56.4B. I see a Zacks Value score of A, a Zacks Growth score of B, and a Zacks Momentum score of A.(2) Stellantis: This is a $15 a share Foreign Auto company, with a market cap of $46.2B.

169,2d1ec148-5655-3523-96db-6998e07573df,ROST,2022-11-23,Ross Stores (ROST) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-rost-great-momentum-170005330.html,1669136405,STORY,['ROST'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ross Stores (ROST), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ross Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ROST that show why this discount retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ROST, shares are up 11.87% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry is up 0.8% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 28.95% compares favorably with the industry's 12.05% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Ross Stores have risen 29.14%, and are up 1.02% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -6.17% and -14.53%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ROST's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ROST is currently averaging 3,471,428 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ROST.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ROST's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.99 to $4.23 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ROST is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Ross Stores on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ANF posted third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines declined year over year. However, both metrics surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company remains impressed with the improvement in sales trends amid a tough global macroeconomic landscape due to the strength of its brands. Although net sales dipped year over year, the metric remained flat on a constant-currency basis. The company highlighted that average unit retail improved for the tenth straight quarter.Management is cautious but remains encouraged about the holiday season amid the dynamic environment. In its earnings release, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch stated that it has sufficient inventory on hand to cater to holiday season demand. ANF also curtailed expenditures where necessary. Apart from this, it remains on track with its 2025 Always Forward plan.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureAbercrombie reported adjusted earnings of 1 cent per share in the third quarter compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents. Our estimate for the bottom line was a loss of 8 cents a share.

Our estimates for Hollister and Abercrombie sales were $450.5 million and $380.6 million, respectively.Story continuesMarginsThe gross margin contracted 450 bps to 59.2%. The decline can be attributed to 370 bps of escalated raw material and freight costs and 60 bps of an unfavorable currency impact.Operating expenses, excluding other operating income, remained almost in line with the year-ago period. Increased inflation and digital fulfillment expenses were offset by lower marketing and incentive-based compensation.As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 57.2% rose 140 bps from 55.8% in the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating income was $21 million compared with $79 million in the year-ago period.Other FinancialsAbercrombie ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $257.3 million, long-term net borrowings of $296.5 million and stockholders’ equity of $646.2 million, excluding non-controlling interests.The company had liquidity of $617 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter, which included cash and equivalents and borrowing available under the ABL Facility.

It closed one Hollister and Abercrombie store each. As of Oct 29, 2022, its total store base was 751, including 541 stores in the United States and 210 stores internationally.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, management envisions a net sales decline of 2-4% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 reported level of $1.2 billion. The sales view includes a 300-bps impact of adverse currency rates. The company anticipates an operating margin in the 5-7% band.For fiscal 2022, ANF now expects net sales to dip 2-3% from the year-ago period’s reported figure of $3.7 billion. Earlier, management forecast net sales to decline in the mid-single digits. The sales outlook assumes a negative impact of 250 bps of currency movements compared with the 200-bps impact expected before.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch expects an operating margin of 2-3% now compared with the prior range of 1-3%.

DLTR has reported third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein sales and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year. The results have benefited from the continued demand for the company’s products, offset by inflationary pressures and an unfavorable product mix due to the demand shift toward low-margin consumable goods.The company remains optimistic about its fiscal 2022 top-line performance. Hence, it has raised the fiscal 2022 sales view. Despite the strong sales trends across both banners, the company expects the increased demand for consumables and inflationary costs to affect margins and the bottom line in the near term. Consequently, it has provided a bleak earnings view for fiscal 2022.Shares of DLTR declined 1.9% in the pre-market trading session on Nov 22 despite top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The company likely witnessed soft performance due to ongoing cost pressures and a soft earnings view for fiscal 2022. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 17.6% year to date against the industry's decline of 7.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Quarter in DetailDollar Tree’s earnings improved 25% year over year to $1.20 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 and our estimate of $1.14. Bottom-line growth can be attributed to robust top-line growth, as well as improved margins.Consolidated net sales advanced 8.1% year over year to $6,939.9 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,839 million ad our estimate of $6,833.7 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 6.5% year over year. For the Dollar Tree banner, comps were up 8.6%, while the same for the Family Dollar banner improved 4.1%. After adjusting for the impacts of currency fluctuations, comps for the Dollar Tree banner rose 8.5%.Comps at Dollar Tree benefited from a double-digit increase in average ticket, partly negated by a decline in traffic. Comps at Family Dollar were aided by increases in both ticket and traffic.The gross profit increased 17.5% year over year to $2,071.5 million, while the gross margin expanded 240 bps to 29.9%. Gains from improved initial mark-on, and leverage on distribution and occupancy costs aided the gross margin. This was partly negated by higher markdowns and shrink, inflationary cost pressures, and unfavorable product mix related to a shift toward lower-margin consumable products.

QuoteSelling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 170 bps to 24.4%.

Excluding certain items, profit will be about $2.60 a share. Analysts estimated sales of $3.02 billion and earnings of $2.39 a share.The outlook helped reassure investors after a rocky stretch for the chip business, which is coping with a slowdown in technology spending and the fallout from new rules on exports to China. Semiconductors used in vehicles and factory equipment have remained a bright spot, even as some of the industry’s largest companies, including Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., warn of a slowdown.While orders did decelerate in the first half of the fourth quarter, they leveled out at what the company considers normal levels and have stayed that way into the current period, Chief Financial Officer Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said in an interview.“We take stabilizing orders as a good sign,” he said. “For right now, for the current quarter and a little bit ahead, we feel good.”The company’s automotive business is benefiting from that industry’s migration to more battery-powered vehicles. Analog Devices makes semiconductors that control those batteries. It’s also a major supplier of the systems that move video signals around cars, meaning it’s getting more orders as cars increasingly become equipped with cameras as part of driver-assistance packages.By region, China and Asia are show the biggest amount of weakness due to the worsening economy, he said. Europe and North America have held up relatively well. Analog Devices gets about 20% of its sales from China.Story continuesAnalog Devices shares rose more than 5% in New York trading at midday. They had fallen 9.4% this year through Monday’s close, though that’s a better performance than the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, which is down 32%.Based in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Analog Devices specializes in analog and embedded computing components, a sector led by Texas Instruments Inc.Analog chips convert real-world things -- like sound and pressure -- into electronic signals. And the rush to add automation to factory equipment and buildings stirred new demand in recent years. The move toward battery-powered cars has also fueled the market.Automotive revenue rose 49% from a year earlier, Analog Devices reported. Industrial-related sales were up 40%, and its consumer division -- its smallest unit – an increase of 19%.Revenue was $3.25 billion in the period, which ended Oct. 29. That yielded a profit of $2.73 a share, excluding some items.

Between airport traffic, parking, security lines and delays, the inconveniences can seem endless.For people with disabilities, the process can be even more complicated and intimidating.The Arc of Central Alabama, an organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families, worked with Southwest Airlines - with support from Regions Bank - to host a program recently to make air travel less daunting.The Arc's Wings for All program welcomed a group of their younger clients, ranging in age from three to 18 years, and their families at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport for a mock-travel experience.""The Wings for All program is a life-changing event for so many families.""Paula BedranThe event helps further the organization's mission to support inclusion and participation for people with disabilities. And that important mission is shared by Regions, as well.Kathy Lovell, Regions Disability Services and Outreach manager, said, ""Air travel is an important part of life. Everyone looks forward to going on vacation or visit family and friends.""""This is a trial run that gives these young people some confidence. When a real trip is planned, they'll better understand all the steps involved and will have a very positive experience to recall,"" she said.The participants were ticketed and went through the normal check-in process, including TSA security screenings. They boarded the plane, were served drinks and snacks (very important!) and were provided the usual safety information by flight attendants.""""We tried to make the process as close to a real flight experience as possible,"" said Ashton Johnson, director of development at the Arc of Central Alabama.A lucky few even got to enter the cockpit and sit next to the pilot in the co-pilot seat.""The Wings for All program is a life-changing event for so many families,"" said Paula Bedran, who participated in the event with her son, Mason. ""It helps families understand what challenges may occur at an airport, so that they can plan and pack accordingly for their actual trip.

183,6f96fbe8-eb67-3f9e-a7b3-509b627d690b,RF,2022-11-23,Investing in Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) five years ago would have delivered you a 72% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-regions-financial-nyse-rf-150630040.html,1669129590,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC']","[Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) share price is 45% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 6.4% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Regions Financial In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Regions Financial achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 11.07 also suggests market apprehension.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Regions Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Regions Financial the TSR over the last 5 years was 72%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Regions Financial shares lost 3.3% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Regions Financial's dividend track record.

We’re in a great position for holiday. And this compares to last year when we really didn’t have the inventory that we wanted or needed. So we feel like we’re in a much, much better position.”Even so, there are still plenty of retailers — particularly at lower income levels where inflation in food and fuel is stinging — that are looking to move excess goods this holiday season.Richard Hayne, cofounder, chairman and chief executive officer of Urban Outfitters Inc., said the company’s namesake chain started the third quarter with “heavy inventory left over from the bullwhip effect brought on by COVID-induced supply chain issues. The brand is working through this excess inventory and is planning to be much cleaner by the end of Q4.”Walmart wrestled inventories down from a 25.5 percent increase at the end of the second quarter to a 12.6 percent rise at the end of the third.And while it still has about $1 billion in goods it considers excess, that’s down from about $3 billion in July.Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said inventory has gone from stuck in the supply chain to now stacked up in the store.“We’re making improvements,” Rainey said. “Apparel and certain categories in [general merchandise] are the heavy categories, and we’ll continue to work through those.”One way or another, it’s a retail landscape with a sketchy consumer and a lot of inventory sitting around. Some of that inventory is in safer, “core” products.But no doubt, more would like to be in Macy’s position with just a small increase and an opportunity to chase goods.“Our inventory is in great shape,” said Jeff Gennette, chairman and CEO. “We have roughly 55 percent newness for holiday, 30 percentage points higher than 2019, and we are not saddled with older receipts in pandemic category overstocks.“With our strong vendor relationships and mix of private brand and licensed brands, we can chase into areas of strength that warrant it and have a flexible pricing model to quickly adjust promotions and markdowns if demand does not materialize,” Gennette said.Stocked UpSupply chain disruptions and consumer swings have many merchants sitting on a lot of inventory headed into the holiday season.Inventory at End of Most-recent Quarter (in millions)Year-over-year ChangeMacy’s Inc.$6,4034.3%American Eagle Outfitters Inc.$7987.8%Ross Stores Inc.$2,494.011.8%Gap Inc.$3,04311.8%Walmart Inc.$64,70612.6%Target Corp.$17,11714.4%Urban Outfitters Inc.$74418.6%The TJX Cos.

As a result, founders of software firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) have become billionaires, with software integration playing a crucial role in the manner in which another technology giant, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), operates and maintains a product ecosystem.However, while Apple maintains strict control over its software and is notorious for cracking down on jailbreaking applications which let its users make unapproved modifications to their gadgets, other companies often make their software open source by providing the software code to repositories such as GitHub.Given its vast nature, the exact size and growth of the software industry are hard to pin down. Still, some estimates are available which lay down the size and growth of the entire industry, the open-source services software segment, and the open-source segment itself.For instance, renowned accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluates the industry in the aftermath of the disruption ushered in by the pandemic. PwC outlined in 2020 that the pandemic stands to shrink the global software market to an expected peak growth rate of 7% from an earlier estimate of 9%. Highlighting that the slight downward revision is an indicator of the sector's resilience, PwC also expects the sector's earnings per share (EPS) growth to outperform the Standard &amp; Poor 500 (S&amp;P 500) benchmark index growth. The sector's resilience is due to the uptick in enterprise computing in the wake of the pandemic, which saw companies shift to remote working patterns.Story continuesData from ReserchandMarkets shows that the open-source software services market is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.75% to sit at roughly $67 billion by 2026. A report from MarketandMarkets, for the open-source services market, lists down a CAGR of 23.6% for this segment, mirroring the conclusion reached by ResearchandMarkets. Through this growth rate, the research firm believes that the segment will grow from $8.9 billion in 2016 to sit at roughly $33 billion by the end of next year.Finally, a report from Grand View Research studies the entire software market. Its research suggests that the global business software and services market was worth roughly $390 billion in 2020 and was expected to demonstrate a CAGR of 11.6% through 2028.Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn order to determine the largest open-source software companies in the world, we have chosen to look at their contributions to the internet software hosting service provider GitHub. These contributions are made by employees with official email addresses.

Intense competition though remains a concern.Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player have gained 20.6% against the industry’s decline of 16.6% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 18% in the same time frame.With a market capitalization of $33.32 billion, AmerisourceBergen is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies, focused on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. ABC’s earnings are anticipated to improve 8.2% over the next five years. It beat on earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 2.51%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Driving Growth?It is worth mentioning that AmerisourceBergen made a strategic evaluation of its reporting structure to represent its expanded international presence following the June 2021 buyout of Alliance Healthcare. As a result, starting the first quarter of fiscal 2022, ABC realigned its reporting structure under two reportable segments, namely U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions.Per the segment realignment, U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Proforma), MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group and ICS 3PL. The segment benefits from increasing volume and an expanding customer base. Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the segment in the coming quarters.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, revenues at this segment totaled $54.8 billion, reflecting a rise of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis on the back of higher specialty product sales and overall market growth. However, lower revenues from commercial COVID-19 treatments partially offset this upside. Segmental operating income was $578.4 million, up 14% year over year. Higher gross profit (which included fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments and a gross profit on sales from specialty physician practices) contributed to the upside.Story continuesIn September, AmerisourceBergen signed a definitive agreement to acquire Germany-based PharmaLex Holding GmbH for €1.28 billion ($1.3 billion) in cash. PharmaLex is a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry owned by funds advised by AUCTUS Capital Partners AG. It has a global reach, with a significant footprint in Europe and the United States and a growing presence in other parts of the world. The acquisition of this Germany-based company will enhance ABC’s global portfolio of solutions to support manufacturer partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey.In January, ABC collaborated with TrakCel, the leading innovator of cellular orchestration solutions, to launch an integrated technology platform for accelerating patient access to prescribed cell and gene therapies and providing complete visibility throughout the treatment process.The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare strongly drove AmerisourceBergen’s international segment revenues in fiscal 2022.Adjusted EPS is estimated to be $11.30-$11.60 for fiscal 2023, reflecting 2-5% growth from the fiscal 2022-level. ABC estimates revenue growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2023.What’s Hurting the Stock?AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related healthcare services market. The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and regulatory challenges. ABC encounters additional competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies. Increased competition will affect its business.AmerisourceBergen Corporation PriceAmerisourceBergen Corporation PriceAmerisourceBergen Corporation price | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteEstimate TrendAmerisourceBergen has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023.

SWAV is well-poised for growth, backed by its research and development (R&amp;D) efforts, and a focus on clinical studies.Shares of this presently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player have gained 34.4% against the industry’s decline of 29.2% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 18.3% in the same time frame.With a market capitalization of $9.03 billion, this medical device company is committed to developing and commercializing products created to change the way calcified cardiovascular disease is treated. ShockWave Medical’s earnings yield of 1.15% compares favorably with the industry’s (8.48%). Earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 146.10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Driving Its Performance?ShockWave Medical invests in R&amp;D efforts to accelerate its IVL Technology, thus broadening and enhancing its existing product offerings. In the third quarter of 2022, SWAV incurred R&amp;D expenses of $20.2 million, up 46.9% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.For 2022, Shockwave Medical expects revenues in the range of $483-$488 million (up from the previously guided band of $465-$475 million), implying growth of 104-106% from the prior-year period’s level.SWAV believes in its ability to rapidly develop innovative products owing to the dynamic product innovation process. The versatility and leveraging ability of its core technology and management philosophy are tailwinds that continue to improve the R&amp;D process. Shockwave Medical recruited and retained engineers and scientists with substantial expertise to develop medical devices. SWAV’s pipeline of products in various stages of development is anticipated to provide additional commercial opportunities.Since its inception, ShockWave Medical has committed to generating clinical data to show the safety and effectiveness of its IVL Technology. These initial studies consistently highlighted low rates of complications irrespective of the type of vessel being examined. Apart from getting regulatory approvals or clearances, data from SWAV’s clinical studies strengthen its ability to drive the adoption of Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) Technology throughout multiple therapies in the existing and new market segments.Story continuesShockWave Medical’s past studies guided optimal IVL procedure technique and enriched the design of its IVL System and products in development. Management is optimistic about the continued clinical acceptance and penetration of IVL, as demonstrated by its strong results in the quarter under review as well as a higher outlook for revenues in 2022.This apart, SWAV has ongoing clinical programs for several products and indications. On being successful, these will enable it to expand the commercialization of its products into new geographies and indications.Shockwave Medical received regulatory approval for the Shockwave C2 Coronary IVL Catheter in Japan earlier in 2022. Besides, SWAV announced the introduction and global availability of the Shockwave M5+ peripheral IVL catheter post the receipt of the CE mark and the FDA clearance.What’s the Downside?Limited commercialization expertise and approved or cleared products pose a challenge to Shockwave Medical in evaluating its current business and determining its future financial performance and growth.ShockWave Medical, Inc.

However, adjusted earnings declined 1.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Currency-adjusted EPS came in at $1.31 in the quarter.Our model projected an adjusted EPS of $1.29 for the second quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization and restructuring expenses, acquisition-related costs and certain medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP EPS was 32 cents, down 67% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.59 billion, up 2% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency) and down 3% on a reported basis. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%.The fiscal second-quarter revenues compares to our own estimate of $7.99 billion.The Q2 organic revenues, according to the company, reflect slower supply recovery and lower-than-anticipated underlying market procedure volumes in certain businesses and the pricing impact of volume-based procurement in China. These were partially offset by strength in certain product lines, including Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVR), Cardiac Pacing, Core Spine in the United States and Diabetes in International.Q2 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (54% of total revenues) were up 2% on a reported basis (up 1% on an organic basis) to $4.07 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.16 billion (28% of total revenues), down 13% on a reported basis (up 3% on an organic basis).Emerging market revenues (18% of total revenues) amounted to $1.36 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 4% organically).Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.Story continuesIn the fiscal second quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 4.4% at CER to $2.77 billion, with all three divisions returning to organic growth this quarter, including a high-single-digit increase in Structural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA) and low-single-digit increases in Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF) and Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV).Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Medtronic PLC Quote CRHF sales totaled $1.43 billion, up 3.5% year over year at CER. Revenues from SHA were up 8.1% at CER to $757 million. CPV revenues were up 1.7% at CER to $584 million.For the Cardiovascular segment, we projected $2.92 billion in revenues for the fiscal second quarter.In Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2.07 billion, down 3.5% year over year at CER. A low-double-digit decline in Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal (RGR) was partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Surgical Innovations (SI). Excluding the impact of COVID-led strong ventilator sales in the prior year, Medical Surgical revenues dropped 1% at CER.Our model estimated Medical Surgical revenues of $2.32 billion for the second quarter.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.19 billion were up 5% year over year at CER, driven by a high-single-digit increase in Specialty Therapies, a mid-single-digit increase in Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies (CST)and Neuromodulation revenues remaining unchanged on a year-over-year basis, all organically.For the Neuroscience segment, we too projected fiscal second-quarter revenues of $2.19 billion.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 3% at CER to $556 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenue declined in low-double digits in Q2, offset by mid-teens growth organic growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-double-digit growth organic growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by high-teens growth of insulin pumps, low-twenties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products and high-single-digit growth in consumable sales.Our model projected Diabetes revenues of $553.9 million in Q2.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 66.6% on a 5.6% fall in gross profit to $5.05 billion.Research and development expenses were unchanged year over year at $676 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses inched up 0.1% to $2.62 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 308 bps year over year to 23.2%.GuidanceMedtronic issued a fiscal 2023 second-half revenue-growth guidance.Second-half revenue growth is expected in the range of 3.5-4% on an organic basis, accelerating over the first half. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of November, revenue growth in the fiscal year 2023 would be affected by $1.74-$1.84 billion compared with the previous range of $1.4-$1.5 billion impact.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 worldwide revenues is pegged at $31.52 billion.The company updated its fiscal 2023 financial guidance for EPS.Full-year adjusted EPS projection has been updated in the range of $5.25 to $5.30 (a reduction from earlier $5.53 to $5.65), including an estimated 18 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.52.Our TakeMedtronic recorded an earnings beat and a revenue miss for the fiscal second quarter. Barring Medical Surgical group, the company reported year-over-year sales growth in each of its reporting segments organically. The company’s second-half sales outlook for fiscal 2023 assumes considerable organic growth from the year-ago period’s levels, instilling optimism.However, a substantial decline in Medical Surgical revenues is a concern. Contraction of both margins raises apprehension too. Macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK, all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

200,a334cb1a-3e6f-363e-916e-475f74f93cef,MCK,2022-11-23,Here's Why You Should Hold on to Abiomed (ABMD) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-abiomed-abmd-150503537.html,1669129503,STORY,"['ABMD', 'AMN', 'MCK', 'SWAV']","[Abiomed, Inc. ABMD is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by strength in its Impella product line. The optimism led by robust second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance along with positive tidings on the regulatory front are expected to contribute further. Headwinds from third-party reimbursement and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 14.8% against 26.9% decline of the industry and 17.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global provider of medical products designed to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart has a market capitalization of $16.98 billion. The company projects 25% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 15.6% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Impella: Abiomed’s flagship product line, Impella, has continued to be a growth driver, raising our optimism. The company is focused on achieving its Abiomed 2.0 goals, which will drive the rollout of its remote interface technology with SmartAssist and Impella Connect. Abiomed continues to invest in its pipeline of advanced technologies, including the XR Sheath, Impella ECP, Impella Connect, Impella BTR and new AI algorithms.Regulatory Approvals: Abiomed has been riding on a suite of regulatory approvals of late, which raises our optimism. In October, Abiomed announced that Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist has received the FDA’s pre-market approval (PMA) as safe and effective to treat acute right heart failure for up to 14 days.The same month, Abiomed announced that the FDA had accepted and closed the post-approval study reports related to the PMA for Impella heart pumps.Strong Q2 Results: Abiomed’s solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings buoy optimism. The company saw a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines, and continued strength in its global Impella revenues. Abiomed’s robust geographical performance is also encouraging.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: Abiomed faces competition from other companies offering circulatory care products, which is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. It competes with companies that have greater resources and experience than Abiomed. The company’s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to distinguish its company and products from its competitors and their products.Third-Party Reimbursement: Abiomed depends on third-party reimbursement to its customers for market acceptance of its products. Sales of medical devices largely depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is McKesson (MCK). MCK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 14.35, which compares to its industry's average of 16.96.

MCK's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 21.45. Over the past year, MCK's P/CF has been as high as 24.50 and as low as -10.53, with a median of 20.69.Story continuesThese are just a handful of the figures considered in McKesson's great Value grade.

MMSI recently announced the U.S. commercial release of its PreludeSYNC EZ Radial Compression Device. It complements the company’s radial portfolio of products that includes the Prelude IDeal, Merit Medical’s thin-walled hydrophilic sheath introducer with improved kink and compression resistance.The new device is the latest addition to Merit Medical’s product suite to advance transradial access for endovascular patient care.The latest launch is expected to solidify Merit Medical’s foothold in the domestic cardiovascular space.Significance of the ReleasePer Merit Medical’s estimates, the rate of radial artery access use in the United States is presently registering a significant rise. The benefits from this process include fewer bleeding complications, improved patient comfort and decreased procedure costs, unlike femoral procedures or those performed through the femoral artery in the groin.The PreludeSYNC EZ Radial Compression Device has been designed for optimal clinical performance, as it aids in achieving access site patent hemostasis (the prevention of bleeding) following radial artery access procedures.The device is equipped with an exclusive cinch-style wristband that supports controlled and precise two-handed placement. This is a key feature that differentiates it from other radial compression devices currently available in the market. Besides, a large window provides clear visibility that has been designed to further help with precise placement. The device has been engineered for the benefit of both patient and clinician as it provides a simplified alternative to the two-strap compression band currently on the market.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Verified Market Research published on BCC Research, the global radial artery compression devices market was valued at $357.31 million in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $633.71 million by 2027 at a CAGR of approximately 7.4%. Factors like the rapid growth in the elderly population leading to the subsequent increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and widespread unhealthy lifestyle choices are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest launch is expected to provide a significant boost to Merit Medical’s business in the niche space.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Merit Medical announced its third-quarter 2022 results, where it registered better-than-expected performance and saw a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. Merit Medical also recorded revenue growth in the Cardiovascular segment and across the majority of its product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Solid product sales were also promising. Robust performances in the United States and outside were impressive.In September, Merit Medical announced the U.S. commercial release of the TEMNO Elite Soft Tissue Biopsy System, the latest addition to its comprehensive portfolio of biopsy devices.The same month, Merit Medical announced the U.S. commercial release of the Prelude Roadster Guide Sheath. Following the release, the Prelude Roadster becomes the latest addition to the Merit Vascular-Peripheral Access portfolio, which includes introducers and other products like access kits, vessel dilators and accessories.Price PerformanceMerit Medical stock has gained 3.2% over the past year against the industry’s 12.7% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 17.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Merit Medical carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

203,d5f8d7d9-10b6-3f43-94a6-d0460b6b6db1,MCK,2022-11-23,Buy These 5 Corporate Giants Flying High in Disappointing 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-corporate-giants-flying-130601542.html,1669122361,STORY,"['MPC', 'ADM', 'XOM', 'MCK', 'MRK']","[Less than six weeks of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been complicated further by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Demand has remained rock solid owing to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus given in the last two pandemic-ridden years.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.3%, 17.1% and 29.5%, respectively. Despite these headwinds, several corporate bigwigs have flourished this year with more upside left. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, McKesson Corp. MCK, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) in October rose 0.4% month over month and 7.7% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a month-over-month rise of 0.5% and a year-over-year gain of 7.9%Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% month over month and 6.3% year over year. The consensus estimate was for a rise of 0.5% month over month and 6.5% year over year.On Nov 15, the Department of Labor reported that the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of a 0.5% rise. September’s data was revised downward from 0.4% to 0.2%.Year over year, PPI rose 8%, dropping from the 8.4% rise in September. Core PPI increased 0.2% in October compared with the consensus estimate of 0.4%. Year over year, core PPI rose 5.4% in October.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3% gain. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with market expectations.Story continuesAs peak inflation seems behind us, the Fed is likely to relax its tighter monetary control. The central bank is expected to reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. This will help the overall equity market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) that have popped year to date. These stocks have solid growth potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Zacks Rank #1 Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the last 30 days. The stock price of ADM has surged 42.2% year to date.Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Zacks Rank #1 Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3 % over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has soared 88% year to date.McKesson provides pharmaceuticals and medical supplies in the United States and internationally. The strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instill optimism.Strong adjusted operating profit growth across the key segments of MCK is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. McKesson played a crucial role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the United States and abroad via the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.Zacks Rank #2 McKesson has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of MCK has climbed 48.3% year to date.Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business.At the same time, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. With the reopening of the global economy, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.Zacks Rank #2 Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of XOM has jumped 81.3% year to date.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, should be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth.Zacks Rank #2 Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MRK has advanced 37.8% year to date.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

They left impressed.Cummins Corporate Responsibility Director Travis Meek said he was aware of oysters' amazing ability to filter out pollutants but until he saw the project first-hand, he didn't fully appreciate its other environmental benefits.""Louisiana is losing shoreline at a rate of 75 square kilometers per year, which is faster than anywhere on earth,"" said Meek, who oversees Cummins Water Works. ""While the reefs are only one of many needed solutions, they significantly slow the rate of erosion where they've been built.""Cummins Water Works is the company initiative to address the global water crisis by partnering with leading water experts and investing and engaging in sustainable, large scale, high impact water projects.The Wabash River watershed, which includes Cummins' headquarters in Columbus, Indiana, is the single largest contributor of excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous from fertilizer to the Mississippi River Basin.These excess nutrients not only pollute drinking water systems in the Midwest, but also contribute to an extensive dead zone, roughly the size of Massachusetts, in the Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana-Texas coastline.The Nature Conservancy is working with farmers in the Midwest on the benefits of sustainable farming practices like no-till farming to reduce the runoff of excess nutrients. A team of Cummins employees recently worked with the environmental group to reintroduce mussels in parts of the upper watershed to help clean and filter water before it reaches the gulf.Story continuesOyster reefs do much the same thing, serving as one of nature's most efficient filtration systems, according to Seth Blitch, The Nature Conservancy's Conservation Director in Louisiana. Blitch led the Cummins' team on their tour of the project.He said a healthy, one-acre reef can filter approximately 24 million gallons of water each day. Oyster reefs can also serve as natural buffers against rising sea levels from climate change as well as storm events.The reefs are constructed using wire baskets called gabions filled with limestone placed close to the shoreline to ensure the bulk of any erosion from wave action doesn't get far.Over time, oysters cluster on the baskets and fuse together, creating rock-like reefs that provide habitat for other marine life. The reefs also dampen wave energy that would otherwise cause erosion.The Nature Conservancy has so far restored over seven miles of oyster reefs. Phase III of the project, which extends the reef for about a mile, was constructed in July and August. Blitch said The Nature Conservancy was able to significantly expand the scope of its original plan with Cummins' support.Brian Mormino, Cummins' Executive Director - Technical &amp; Environmental Systems, said the trip left him with a renewed appreciation for the knowledge and dedication of The Nature Conservancy, and the complexity of the challenge moving forward.""It's one thing to know about a challenge and another to see it,"" Mormino said. ""I think the trip strengthened our commitment to what we're doing, and our desire to do more.""Cummins Inc., Tuesday, November 22, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727815/Putting-Oyster-Power-To-Work-To-Help-the-US-Gulf-Coast]"

The underperformance reflects a lower-than-expected oil price, to go with higher expenses.However, FANG’s bottom line was significantly above the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $2.94 per share, backed by the positive effects of surging natural gas realizations.Revenues of $2.4 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3% and increased 27.6% from the year-ago quarter’s sales of $1.9 billion.In more news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, FANG’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 75 cents per share to its common shareholders of record on Nov 17. The payout will be made on Nov 25. In addition to the regular dividend, FANG declared a special dividend of $1.51 per share.The company also executed $472 million of share repurchases during the third quarter of 2022 at $120.50 apiece.Diamondback Energy, Inc.

An increase in trading volumes, product expansion through prudent acquisitions and the increased adoption of a greater number of crypto assets are expected to benefit Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE, CME Group CME, Cboe Global Markets CBOE, Nasdaq NDAQ and MarketAxess Holdings MKTX. Increasing focus on accelerating their non-trading revenue base, which includes market technology, listing and information revenues, infuses dynamism in the business profile of the industry players. However, alterations in investment patterns, and priorities and compliance with regulations pose challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry comprises companies that operate electronic marketplaces, which facilitate the buying and selling stocks, stock options, bonds or commodity contracts. They facilitate trading across a diverse range of products in multiple asset classes and geographies. They generate revenues from fees received from the listed companies on their exchanges. They also provide a range of data and listing services to global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, investments, risk management, desktops, and connectivity solutions, as well as corporate and ETF listing services, on the cash equity exchanges of the industry players. The industry is witnessing increased adoption of crypto assets. Yet, the players have to comply with a number of regulations, posing challenges.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Securities and Exchanges IndustryVolatility Fueling Trading Volume: The players in the industry are largely dependent on product and service portfolios for revenues. Major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services plus trading, and clearing systems services. Other revenue sources include data products and financial indexes, along with information and public company services. The maximization of transaction and clearing fees, and the lowering of transaction-based expenses drive profits. Sustainable trading volume growth, driven by trading volatility, fuels transaction and clearing fees (a major component of the top line of industry players). Increasing focus on accelerating the non-trading revenue base, which includes market technology, listing and information revenues, infuses dynamism in the business profiles of the industry participants.Mergers and acquisitions:  The industry continues to witness mergers and acquisitions with companies evaluating opportunities to supplement their internal growth story by forging strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies. These enable them to penetrate untapped markets, offer new products or services, and enhance the value of their platforms and existing trade-related operations. Additionally, strategic buyouts lead to a diversified product portfolio (the primary growth catalyst) and help industry participants maintain their domestic market share, as well as fortify their global footprint.Continuous Investment in Technology: Industry players continue to invest heavily in technological development. Focus on building a strategic economic market model via technological advancements and upgrades of products and services will help all exchanges to stay afloat amid changing industry dynamics. In recent years, the players have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machine learning, automation and algorithms designed to improve trading decisions, while reducing trading inefficiencies, cyber threats and human errors, thus accelerating trading frequency. Players are also investing in automating non-trading operations that play an important part in revenue generation for the companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

Iger, popularly known as Bob Iger, as CEO, effective immediately.Bob Iger replaces Bob Chapek, following the latter’s two-year stint. The reappointment of Bob Iger as the CEO has bought a spree of excitement among investors as share prices have been surging ever since the news broke out on Nov 20 Shares jumped 6.3% to close at $97.58 on Nov 21.The lingering impact of the COVID, raging inflation and rising interest rates do not bode well for Disney’s consumer-oriented businesses. Shares have declined more than 37% year-to-date.Disney has been struggling in its streaming division with the increased cost of production and delayed releases lately.However, with Bob Iger taking charge once again, investors are expected to gain back their lost confidence in the company’s prospects.Bob Iger had actively been involved in launching the launch of Disney+ in 2019. His expertise and experience of more than four decades are likely to help the company create an efficient and cost-effective structure for the streaming platform.Where is Disney’s Streaming Division Heading To?Disney has been heavily investing in its streaming services to launch new movies and shows to gain traction. This has aided subscriber growth as Disney+ added more than 12 million global subscribers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.However, Disney’s direct-to-consumer division reported an operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, that doubled year-over-year. This has been attributed to macroeconomic factors like inflation, which have spiked up the cost of production for the company, as well as adverse foreign exchange impact that decreased Disney+’s ARPU by 5%.The Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteDisney+ also faces significant competition from Netflix NFLX, which has a strong pipeline of content and has reached 223 million subscribers worldwide to date. A saturated streaming market with the presence of services from the likes of Apple AAPL and Comcast CMCSA is creating headwind for Disney+.Streaming market leader, Netflix, reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 subscriber numbers. The streaming giant gained 2.41 million paid subscribers globally, higher than its estimate of gaining one million users. Netflix added 4.38 million paid subscribers in the year-ago quarter.Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+, continues to gain recognition with its critically acclaimed and popular shows like Ted Lasso.Comcast’s Peacock had more than 15 million paid subscribers in the United States at the end of third-quarter 2022. Moreover, Peacock had approximately 14 million bundled and free users, totaling around 30 million monthly active accounts.Nevertheless, Disney is focusing on the realignment of cost, including meaningful rationalization of marketing spending and optimization of content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement.The company expects Disney+ to reach profitability by 2024. It is also counting on releases such as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Avatar: The Way of Water to fuel its subscriber acquisition.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also about to launch a cheaper, ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+ to attract even more viewers and diversify its revenue stream. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The ad-supported version will launch on Dec 8 for $7.99 a month, while its basic ad-free subscription jumps to $10.99.ESPN+, the sports streaming platform of Disney, has also been taking steps to boost its top line.It renewed the Major League Baseball sports rights deal through 2028 and entered a long-term partnership with the National Football League, where it has agreed on a five-year rights deal with the NFL to broadcast the league’s Monday night Wild Card playoff game through the 2025 season.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip this part and jump ahead to 5 Biggest Open Source Companies in the World.The advent of the modern-day computing era has seen an unexpected and unprecedented boom in the use of electronic devices. The proliferation of the personal computer and the smartphone have resulted in billions of users having access to computing devices. These devices, made up of physical hardware and virtual software, have generated billions in revenue for technology companies. As a result, founders of software firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) have become billionaires, with software integration playing a crucial role in the manner in which another technology giant, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), operates and maintains a product ecosystem.However, while Apple maintains strict control over its software and is notorious for cracking down on jailbreaking applications which let its users make unapproved modifications to their gadgets, other companies often make their software open source by providing the software code to repositories such as GitHub.Given its vast nature, the exact size and growth of the software industry are hard to pin down. Still, some estimates are available which lay down the size and growth of the entire industry, the open-source services software segment, and the open-source segment itself.For instance, renowned accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluates the industry in the aftermath of the disruption ushered in by the pandemic. PwC outlined in 2020 that the pandemic stands to shrink the global software market to an expected peak growth rate of 7% from an earlier estimate of 9%. Highlighting that the slight downward revision is an indicator of the sector's resilience, PwC also expects the sector's earnings per share (EPS) growth to outperform the Standard &amp; Poor 500 (S&amp;P 500) benchmark index growth. The sector's resilience is due to the uptick in enterprise computing in the wake of the pandemic, which saw companies shift to remote working patterns.Story continuesData from ReserchandMarkets shows that the open-source software services market is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.75% to sit at roughly $67 billion by 2026. A report from MarketandMarkets, for the open-source services market, lists down a CAGR of 23.6% for this segment, mirroring the conclusion reached by ResearchandMarkets. Through this growth rate, the research firm believes that the segment will grow from $8.9 billion in 2016 to sit at roughly $33 billion by the end of next year.Finally, a report from Grand View Research studies the entire software market. Its research suggests that the global business software and services market was worth roughly $390 billion in 2020 and was expected to demonstrate a CAGR of 11.6% through 2028.Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn order to determine the largest open-source software companies in the world, we have chosen to look at their contributions to the internet software hosting service provider GitHub. These contributions are made by employees with official email addresses. While other approaches which evaluate the firms based either on their market capitalization or revenues are tempting, in our opinion, the true metric is GitHub contributions, since they form the backbone of the open source space.

Tied to some of the most innovative firms in the business ecosystem, these securities might fly higher once broader conditions normalize. Of course, that’s a tricky matter at the moment.Unfortunately, millionaire-maker tech stocks suffer disproportionately in the present environment. With the Federal Reserve committed to attacking inflation through benchmark interest rate hikes, the money stock shrunk in response. However, this action also kills incentives for expansionary initiatives which technology firms thrive on.Still, another, more positive narrative rings true. Given the macroeconomic headwinds, millionaire-maker tech stocks find themselves on discount. If you have contrarianism running through your veins, these ideas may draw intrigue.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMUMicron Technology$58.58EVTCEvertec$32.76SMTCSemtech$29.49CCRDCoreCard$30.34UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.43SPRSSurge Components$3.15MNDOMIND C.T.I.$2.19Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comAs one of the top producers of computer memory and data storage solutions, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) commands exceptional relevance. At the same time, MU stock dropped nearly 39% in equity value on a year-to-date basis. Here’s the thing: the volatility isn’t exactly what you would call unwarranted.With demand for computers and consumer electronics weakening, memory sales dropped significantly. Of course, this dynamic hurt Micron but it wasn’t an exclusive headwind. At the same time, management is getting ahead of the demand fallout, scaling back production of its chip wafers. In addition, Micro aims to cut capital expenses.What that leaves us with is an undervalued investment. Currently, MU shares trade at 7.6-times trailing earnings, below the industry median price-earnings ratio of 17.3 times. Also, its Shiller PE ratio is 12 times, well below the industry median of 27.4 times. Combined with Micron’s excellent profit margins, MU has the makings of one of the millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy.Story continuesEvertec (EVTC)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockBased in Puerto Rico, Evertec (NYSE:EVTC) is a leading electronic transactions and technology company. The company provides services across three key areas: merchant acquiring, payment processing, and business solutions. In addition, Evertec notes that it owns and operates the largest debit network in the Caribbean.Unfortunately, the dour environment for the global economy negatively affected EVTC. Since the beginning of this year, shares gave up more than 34% of their equity value. Further, the company posted mixed results for its third quarter, beating revenue expectations but also missing the earnings target. Still, forward-looking investors may have a discount on their hands.Fundamentally, Evertec enjoys excellent profit margins. For instance, its net margin of 41% beats out over 97% of its competitors. As well, the company enjoys a solid balance sheet. On top of this, the market prices EVTC at 9-times TTM earnings, which is comparatively undervalued.In fact, Gurufocus.com notes that EVTC features eight good signs and no negatives, a rarity. Therefore, it belongs on your list of millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy.Semtech (SMTC)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Camarillo, California, Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC) is a supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms for consumer, enterprise computing, communications, and industrial end markets. Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned weaknesses in the global economy – particularly in the tech space – SMTC suffered sharp losses.How sharp? We’re talking about an erosion of 67% of equity value since the beginning of the year, an absolute beatdown. Unfortunately, Semtech didn’t help its own cause out, downgrading expectations for its fiscal Q3. What made the matter particularly painful was that in Q2, the company did very well, generating record revenue and earnings.Still, the organization, which specializes in applications for the Internet of Things, offers great value for contrarians. Similar to Evertec, Gurufocus.com notes that Semtech features five good signs with no blights. Again, it’s a rarity, reflecting the all-around fiscal resilience undergirding SMTC. Not surprisingly, then, the company deserves a look as one of the millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy.CoreCard (CCRD)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Norcross, Georgia, CoreCard (NYSE:CCRD) is a leading issuer-processor and provider of card management and transaction processing systems. It offers an array of account management and system of record solutions to support the complex requirements of the evolving global financial services industry. Sadly, the challenge with this narrative is that the global economy is also evolving but not in the right direction.As you might expect, CCRD feels the heat. Since the start of this year, shares gave up 26% of equity value. Still, it’s wrong to overlook the company based on this performance metric. For instance, over the trailing month, CCRD gained a staggering 31%. Part of the reason could be the value proposition, with CoreCard trading at an attractive multiple.Per data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices CCRD at 16-times TTM earnings, below the sector median of 25.6 times. As well, CoreCard features a strong balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio of 12 times. That’s better than nearly 66% of the competition.Finally, the investment resource identifies five good signs with CoreCard, with no negatives. Thus, it’s well worth considering for millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy.United Microelectronics (UMC)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockA leading global semiconductor foundry company, United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) undergirds various industries and innovations. Per its website, UMC in part provides diversified process technology solutions to power the IoT and wearable world. Additionally, the company plays a pivotal role in the mobile and wireless communication sectors.Obviously, UMC does not represent an island to itself. With global macroeconomic pressures hurting many other millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy, I’m afraid UMC offers no exception in terms of volatility. Since the beginning of this year, shares plunged nearly 36%. Nevertheless, near-term momentum strengthened conspicuously, with UMC gaining almost 27% of equity value.What drives this sentiment spike? Quite possibly, investors are getting word that UMC is criminally undervalued. Despite its stable balance sheet and strong growth and outstanding profitability metrics, the market prices UMC at only 9.7-times forward earnings, below the industry median of 15.3 times. However, this discount won’t last, making UMC one of the millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy now.Surge Components (SPRS)light bulb on abstract technology backgroundSource: Thitichaya Yajampa / Shutterstock.comBased out of Deer Park, New York, Surge Components (OTCMKTS:SPRS) specializes in technological components. From electronic switches to capacitors (electrolytic, film, and ceramic) to discrete semiconductors, Surge undergirds the needs of various industries and applications. Still, as an unsung hero, the underlying narrative presents great risks.Since the Jan. opener, SPRS dropped about 16% in equity value. Structurally, SPRS being traded over the counter creates challenges for prospective investors. With an average share volume of 6,680, liquidity will be a concern. Also, at the time of writing,  Surge features a market capitalization of less than $18 million. Of course, such nano-cap plays provide incredible upside in the context of millionaire-maker tech stocks. Still, you should recognize the dangers.Despite some flaws, however, Gurufocus.com notes that the company features six good signs and no negatives. Therefore, SPRS represents a hidden gem among speculative millionaire-maker tech stocks to buy. Perhaps most notably, Surge commands a stable balance sheet, backed by a cash-to-debt ratio of 5 times.Mind C.T.I. (MNDO)A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustrationSource: whiteMocca / ShutterstockBased in Israel, Mind C.T.I. (NASDAQ:MNDO) is a global provider of billing and customer care solutions for voice, data, video, and content services. Trading hands for a little over two bucks, MNDO presents significant risks. For instance, since the start of the year, MNDO gave up 31% of its equity value. While other millionaire-maker tech stocks flourished in the trailing month, MNDO only gained less than 2%.However, for the patient speculator, MNDO deserves a second look. Broadly speaking, the company slips well under the radar. Simultaneously, though, this quality enables traders to take moonshots smartly. One of the strongest attributes undergirding Mind is its balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.7 times (above nearly 70% of the competition), MNDO can weather economic turbulence.Additionally, the company enjoys outstanding profit margins. For example, its net margin stands at 25%, beating out over 94% of its rivals. Enticingly, the market prices MNDO at only 8-times trailing earnings, below the sector median of 25.6 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip this part and see the top 5 entries in this list by clicking 5 Most Profitable Franchises in the World.Franchises are all around us. From your early morning coffee to late-night fast food indulgences, most of the money you spend go to the companies operating through the franchise model. For starters, a franchise is a business in which an individual uses rights to use the brand name, services, products, and logo to operate at different locations in return for some conditions and an annual license fee. A franchiser is a company that sells the rights of the brands to the individual known as the franchisee.Franchises are one of the many ways businesses expand into new regions and international markets. By licensing to local individuals, franchisers take advantage by integrating their business principles and practices with local history, culture, religion, and customs. On the other hand, entrepreneurs take advantage of brand’s reputation and loyalty by becoming a franchisee. It has been reported that consumers prefer a proven and standard quality product over new brands. On the same lines, consumers expect that the same quality products are offered by brands all over the world irrespective of the region. Hence the correct transfer of knowledge and business knowledge is necessary for the franchiser.Franchises seem to be a lucrative source of income, but they come at a high price. Usually, there is an initial investment that is required in order to open the business. This includes franchise fees and other set-up costs. This can range from $24,000 in the case of Century 21 Real Estate to $118 million in the case of Marriott Hotel. Other than the initial investment, there are annual licensing fee, and royalty that are paid by the franchisee over the tenure of the business.The franchise industry is dominated by fast food or quick-service restaurants. The booming quick service restaurant (QSR) industry in the United States generated a revenue of $255.8 billion in 2020. Major players in the QSR industry include big household names such as McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD), Burger King Worldwide Inc (NYSE: BKW), and brands of Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell.Story continuesThe measurement of profitability of a franchise is an important aspect when venturing into a franchise business. But the profitability cannot be calculated as an exact science. The success of a franchise can not be solely determined from the sales or revenue it generate. The profitability needs to include many factors like the growth in the number of franchises of the brand, the success of franchises (measured through number of franchises being operational after a year), and the company's financial statements. Moreover, brand recognition is also a major factor. This is the reason why Chick-fil-A makes more than Dunkin' in sales but does not have the same brand recognition outside of the US as Dunkin' does.20 Most Profitable Franchises in the WorldOur MethodologyIn order to compile the list for the most 20 profitable franchises in the world, we have taken the rankings from the report published by Franchise Direct which used Franchise Disclosure Documents and press releases to rank the companies based on parameters like sales revenue, number of locations, location growth, age, franchising tenure, and corporate citizenship. Although we have mentioned annual sales of all the companies, annual sales is not the sole parameter in ranking. For example, annual sales generated by single franchise of Marriott International Inc. (NYSE:MAR) is the highest but it has relatively higher initial and operating costs reducing the profits earned by franchise owner.All data points are as of September 2021.Most Profitable Franchises in the World20.

248,2ef7d0f1-ba27-36f9-b6ec-8d4c7096e700,PCAR,2022-11-23,Dillard's and Match Group have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dillards-match-group-highlighted-zacks-132501742.html,1669123501,STORY,"['MTCH', 'TSLA', 'DDS', 'PCAR', 'HOG']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 22, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Dillard's DDS as the Bull of the Day and Match Group MTCH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla TSLA, Harley-Davidson HOG and PACCAR PCAR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Dillard's maintains its Zacks #1 Rank status after another strong earnings report where analysts boosted estimates for the current quarter and next year.We'll go over the details of the report from November 10 right after we check in with the solid analysis from my colleague Brian Hayes last month. Here's what Bryan observed...Dillard's is a long-term market winner within the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The stock has held up extraordinarily well this year while the general market continues to hover in bear territory. Stocks that are able to show resilience during bear markets and weather the volatility tend to lead the upside once the market turns the corner.DDS sports the highest-possible 'A' rating in our Zacks Value Style Score category, indicating an increased likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher. Dillard's is trading at just a 7.53 forward P/E. The powerful combination of relative undervaluation and positive earnings estimate revisions should serve bullish DDS investors well into the future.Recent Earnings and Future EstimatesDDS has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters. Back in August, the company reported Q2 EPS of $9.3/share, a +222.92% surprise over the $2.88 consensus estimate. Dillard's has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of +214.96%. When a company is consistently exceeding estimates by this wide of a margin, it typically creates a 'tailwind' and boosts price momentum.Sales for the second quarter of $1.59 billion also topped estimates by 2.23%. DDS has surpassed revenue estimates in each of the last four quarters.In the past 60 days, analysts have raised their full-year EPS projections by +38.34%. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $36.23 per share. Revenues are anticipated to climb 4.79% to $6.8 billion.(end of analysis from Bryan Hayes)Q3 Delivers a 125% Earnings BeatWell, they did it again. Dillard's bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and advanced year over year. This marked the seventh straight quarter of a top and bottom-line beat. Results gained from the continued momentum in consumer demand.Since Dillard's is a core luxury department store in Texas and other energy-rich states, I'm betting that the bull market in oil has a bit to do with it. DDS currently operates 249 full-line Dillard's stores, and 28 clearance stores in 29 states.Adjusted earnings of $10.96 per share significantly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.87. The bottom line rose 11.7% from the year-ago quarter's $9.81 per share.Total revenues of $1,544 million increased 4.3% from the prior-year quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,490 million. However, the figure came below our estimate of $2,100.7 million.Total retail sales (excluding CDI Contractors, LLC) advanced 3% year over year to $1,499 million. Comparable store sales rose 3% year over year. The company witnessed robust sales in cosmetics, men's apparel and accessories, home and furniture, and shoes. On the flip side, juniors' and children's apparel was the weakest performing category.In response to this report, analysts of course had to raise FY'23 (ends in January) EPS by 14% due to the big $6 beat. But they also raised next year's EPS consensus by 10% to $25.10.Story continuesWhile we wait to see if analysts are more optimistic about next year's earnings outlook, the stock remains attractive on a price-to-sales basis trading at under 1 times revenue.Bear of the Day:Match Groupis the $13 billion host extraordinaire for the world's foremost dating websites and operates a portfolio of more than 45 brands. Its biggest and best known outlets are Tinder, Match.com, PlentyOfFish, Meetic and OkCupid.The Dallas, TX-based company offers dating products in 42 languages in more than 190 countries and will cross sales of $3 billion this year, up over 6.9%.The company is currently enjoying moderate growth, driven by robust momentum at Tinder and solid performances from Meetic, Match, Pairs as well as PlentyOfFish.Match came out with quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share recently, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.64 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -9.38%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this media and internet company would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.89, delivering a surprise of 28.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates only two times.Match Group, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $809.55 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.08%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $801.84 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.Revenues of $810 million increased 1% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.14%.Excluding forex, the top line increased 10% year over year to $883 million, driven by 9% growth in revenue per payer (RPP).Quarter in DetailIn the third quarter, the number of total payers increased 2% to 16.5 million. The number of total payers from America and Europe decreased by 0.9% and 1.31%, respectively, whereas the Asia Pacific (APAC) saw an increase of 11% on a year-over-year basis.Total RPP was flat over the prior year's quarter at $16.02. Region-wise, RPP increased 6.07% in America and decreased 14.5% in APAC, while remaining unchanged in Europe year-over-year.America's RPP increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and a la carte purchases at Tinder and Hinge. Europe's RPP was unfavorably impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound, while APAC and Other's RPPs were unfavorably impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen and Turkish lira.Direct revenues from the Americas were up 4.9% to $413.8 million. Direct revenues from Europe and APAC decreased 1.35% to $214.7 million and 4.72 to $166.5 million, respectively.Direct revenues from Tinder grew 6% from the prior-year quarter, driven by 7% Payers growth to 11.1 million, partially offset by an RPP decline of 1%.Direct revenues from All Other Brands collectively declined 5% year over year, along with an 8% Payers decline, which was offset by 3% RRP growth. Within All Other Brands, Hinge Direct Revenue grew nearly 40% year-over-year in the third quarter 2022.Match, Meetic, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish, saw both direct revenue and payers decline 15% year-over-year basis. APAC-based businesses, Pairs and Hyperconnect, saw direct revenue decline 15% year-over-year basis.Bottom line on MTCH: While we want to support people being able to find love online, we have to be wary of investing in the portals for it.Additional content:The Investment Case for Tesla (TSLA): Buy the Latest Dip?Tesla has been one of the most amazing growth stocks since its market debut in 2010, outperforming major tech titans and auto giants. While the electric vehicle (EV) bigwig had its share of ups and downs, it generated mind-boggling returns for patient investors.Indeed, its pricey valuation has never made sense but Tesla fans have always believed in Elon Musk's vision. From a shaky startup, Tesla has come a long way on the back of its soaring popularity of e-mobility, exciting products, aggressive expansion efforts and legions of loyal fans. After running into losses for years, Tesla notched up its first full-year profit in 2020. Ever since, TSLA has managed to be in the black, proving its skeptics wrong.Over the last five years, shares of the company have skyrocketed more than 2,300%. But the stellar run on the bourses hit a pause this year, as is the case with many exciting and high-flying growth stocks. Logistical issues surfaced as a thorn in Tesla's narrative. An ultra-hawkish Fed is further spoiling the momentum. Year to date, Tesla has plummeted roughly 50%, making even its most steady supporters jittery. On Friday, the stock sank to a 52-week low of $176.55, ending the session a tad higher at $180.19.Does the recent dip represent a buying opportunity? Before we look at Tesla's outlook and valuation to see if it is indeed a good time to buy its shares, let's check out what has been ailing the stock's performance lately.Q3 Sales Miss, Twitter Hangover &amp; Other Pain PointsTesla reported third-quarter earnings last month, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.Top-line growth was underwhelming, with sales missing expectations by 4% on revenues of $21.45 billion. A record 343,830 deliveries during the quarter slightly missed expectations as well. Shedding light on logistical challenges, management notified in a press release, ""As our production volumes continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistics weeks."" Of course, investors are discouraged by the sales miss and logistics concerns.Markets aren't reacting too well to Musk's takeover of Twitter. Tesla investors fear that Twitter could be a distraction for the entrepreneur. Musk's selling of TSLA shares to fund Twitter is not going down well with its shareholders. Earlier this month, Musk liquidated more Tesla shares following his Twitter acquisition. He sold 19.5 million shares worth close to $4 billion, bringing the total value of Tesla shares sold by Musk to roughly $20 billion so far this year. A big concern of TSLA shareholders is that Musk will be spread too thin across all his responsibilities because of the Twitter takeover. Speculations are rife that the widely-hailed Tesla CEO doesn't have enough time on his hands to navigate both companies properly.The stock was also hurt by the recent price cuts for its EVs in China. Tesla slashed the prices of Model 3/Y cars by as much as 9% in China during late October amid signs of softening demand and rising competition in the world's largest car market. Tesla is hardly immune to the supply-chain issues, and economic uncertainty and aggressive rate hikes are making matters worse for the automaker.Long-Term Prospects Still StrongThe world is doubling down on EV adoption with government subsidies, policy changes and infrastructure buildup. And Tesla has gradually established itself as a leader in the e-mobility space. This should be the perfect backdrop for solid growth into the foreseeable future. Tesla has a 5-year expected EPS growth rate of 31.4%, higher than the industry's 18.7%.Robust demand for Models 3 and Y, production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin), and introduction of models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support delivery growth. Musk expects deliveries to surge at 30% annualized rate for the foreseeable future. It's also worth noting that Tesla boasts an energy business with the potential to grow faster than its vehicles business. Tesla's energy generation and storage revenues are on a massive growth trajectory, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products.Valuation &amp; Growth EstimatesDespite the massive sell-off this year, Tesla shares are still overvalued. TSLA has a P/E ratio of 34.95, above the industry average of 28.41. While the premium may be a factor, Tesla has never really been a value stock. Also, valuation is starting to become reasonable as the company is consistently improving its business model. Although expensive at 34.95X P/E, the value is the lowest level the shares have traded this year so far. TSLA's P/S of 5.10 is also much lower than its decade-high 18.73 and near-the-median 4.06.While there could be better buying opportunities ahead, Tesla is trading at a far better valuation than it has in the past. Also, electric vehicles still represent a relatively small portion of the auto industry market and the space still has massive scope to grow.Year over year, TSLA's 2022 EPS is now expected to rise 79.2% to $4.05. Earnings in 2023 are expected to jump another 30.5% to $5.29 per share. The top line is expected to climb 54% this year. Estimates point to another 39% ascent to $115.11 billion in 2023, more than quadrupling pre-pandemic sales of $24.57 billion registered in 2019.Final WordsAs Tesla's shares have slumped in the red year to date, long-term investors are therefore presented with an opportunity to buy the dips at a level not seen in some time. TSLA's valuation multiples fell extensively, perhaps enticing investors with a long-term horizon. Further, Tesla has a strong growth profile, with revenue and earnings projected to soar by double-digit percentages in its current year and next. We believe Tesla is a solid long-term investment option at current price levels based on its market leadership, progressively broadening global operations and new product developments that promise to take it to dizzy heights in the coming years.However, near-term headwinds persist. Tesla faces problems related to raw material procurement and logistics. The strong U.S. dollar also doesn't help a company that generates a significant percentage of sales overseas and a substantial ramp-up in production in the country. Commodity inflation has been shrinking the automotive gross margins of Tesla for the past two quarters. Persistent rate hikes and fears of a potential recession may create better opportunities, as the shares could get beaten down further. Considering all the tailwinds and headwinds, it would be a good idea to take a wait-and-see approach on Tesla.

249,124f8a49-c884-3c22-8084-1c7f01686948,NTAP,2022-11-23,NetApp (NTAP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netapp-ntap-earnings-expected-grow-150003831.html,1669129203,STORY,['NTAP'],"[The market expects NetApp (NTAP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.01% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp?For NetApp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NetApp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of +9.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NetApp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.NetApp (NTAP)NetApp provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. The Sunnyvale, CA-based company’s product line comprises two storage platforms - FAS storage platform and E-Series platform. The company’s all-flash storage portfolio comprises NVMe-based storage systems and new cloud-based services in order to provide hybrid storage architecture.NTAP boasts a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of NetApp are trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.2X, as well as a PEG Ratio of 1.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 13.4X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 2.4X.Many value investors pay close attention to a company's earnings as well. For NTAP, one analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $5.48 per share for 2023. Per share NTAP boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.6%.With strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding NTAP to their portfolios.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of small-cap companies and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Small-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Small-cap stocks are companies that have a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion. Over the years, these companies have shown significant growth upside when compared with larger corporations. In addition to this, small-cap companies in the US have delivered strong risk-adjusted returns to shareholders than the large firms in the last 40 years, as reported by Edinburgh-based investment management company Baillie Gifford. The report also mentioned that International Smaller Companies Strategy Composite delivered an annualized return of 22.8% from its inception in 2019 to December 2021, compared with an 18.7% return of the MSCI World All Cap index during the same period.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, small-cap shares are more appealing to investors as they are at the cheapest level relative to their larger counterparts. Another reason for small caps to be favorable among investors is that these companies are domestically-focused and can benefit largely from strong domestic economic growth. The report referred to Wisdom Tree’s data and mentioned that the Russell 2000 index of small-caps is trading at 11.9 times earnings over the next 12 months, falling from its historic 20-year average of 17.2.Another report published by Schroders earlier this year shed light on the overall performance of small-cap companies. The report cited the data from RBC US Equity Strategy and mentioned that earnings per share growth forecasts for small-cap companies were higher than the large-cap companies in the US. In 2014, Russell 2000 Index was projected to show a 17.80% growth in its EPS, compared with a 12% growth for the S&amp;P 500.Over the years, small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap companies when dividends reinvested are included. Julius Baer, a Zurich-based private banking company, referred to the Credit Suisse Global Investments 2018 report, mentioning that the dollar invested in a small-cap company in 1926 would have been seven times more in value by the end of 2018 than the one invested in a large company, including reinvested dividends.Story continuesIn addition to small-cap companies, investors are also focusing on dividend stocks as they provide regular income to them in times of financial volatility. Dividend Aristocrats like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR) are popular among investors as they have raised their dividends for over 25 years.

257,500a8eb9-56d5-35c4-9f6b-7ba75ace47bd,PNR,2022-11-23,Strong Demand to Aid Pentair (PNR) Despite Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-demand-aid-pentair-pnr-175105081.html,1669139465,STORY,"['PNR', 'TWI', 'HUBB']","[Pentair plc PNR is poised well to gain solid demand for swimming pools. Focus on expanding digital transformation, innovation, technology and brand building, acquisitions in the pool as well as residential and commercial water treatment will continue to stoke growth. However, lower expected volumes due to the ongoing correction in inventory, as well as cost inflation and supply-chain disruptions will likely dent the company’s performance in the near term.Low Volumes to Impact 2022 ResultsDuring the first half of 2022, Pentair’s inventory levels had built up in order to support market demand and accommodate the ongoing supply-chain challenges. However, in the third quarter of 2022, it saw the normalization of inventory levels within residential distributor channels. This is expected to impact volume levels for the next few quarters. PNR has also been witnessing inflationary increases in the price of raw materials such as metals, resins and electronics as well as increased logistics costs. Even though pricing actions and productivity improvements will offset these increases, supply-chain challenges and inflationary cost pressure are likely to dent Pentair’s margins in the near term.Pentair now expects the adjusted earnings per share to be around $3.65 in 2022, down from the prior guidance between $3.70 and $3.76. The guidance was lowered to account for increased foreign currency headwinds, higher interest rates and inventory correction. The guidance nevertheless projects a 7% increase from 2021.Results to Improve in 2023The company expects revenues in 2023 to be higher year over year reflecting the contribution from Manitowoc Ice, benefits from pricing actions, and the diversity of its portfolio to offset the ongoing challenges in the residential business and challenges along with foreign currency impact. All these factors, as well as reduced manufacturing inefficiencies, and expected benefits from the Transformation program will help offset higher costs and higher interest rates and lead to year-over-year growth in the company’s earnings per share.Story continuesStrong Pool Demand to Aid GrowthPentair has been witnessing strong demand as consumers are enhancing their at-home quality of life by investing in pools. The emergence of Airbnb and Vrbo has also contributed to the rise in demand for homes with pools. PNR estimates that the pool industry in North America is catering to a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools, with the average age of these pools approaching 25 years.Around 60% of the industrial demand is for repairing, 20% for major remodeling and 20% for new pools. Pentair is poised well to gain from these demand trends in the long term. Also, given that half of the installed pools lack any form of automation, the growing preference for more autonomous and energy-efficient pools will benefit the company as well.Transformation Program to Drive MarginsDuring second-quarter 2021, Pentair launched a Transformation program to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion. The program, structured in multiple phases, is expected to drive operational efficiency, streamline processes, and reduce complexity while meeting financial objectives. It will also utilize automation to increase productivity. The company is projecting at least 300 basis points of margin expansion by 2025 through the program.Innovation, Acquisitions to Expand Water Treatment SolutionsPentair is investing in digital transformation, innovation and technology as well as acquisitions in the high-growth areas of pool, residential and commercial water treatment, which is commendable. In the Water Treatment business, Pentair is investing in innovative components, such as flat-connected valves for water softeners. Within Water Treatment, the company believes that there are opportunities to rapidly expand its $50 million end-to-end residential services business.This July, Pentair completed the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice which enables the company to enhance and deliver total water management offerings to an expanded network of channel partners and customers. The buyout will expand the company’s commercial water solutions platform and drive growth in the food service industry. The acquisition is likely to be accretive to current-year earnings.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPentair’s shares have declined 42.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s loss of 52.7%.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderPentair currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Industrial Products sector are Hubbell HUBB, OI Glass OI and Titan International TWI.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) shareholders have enjoyed a 93% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 45% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Norfolk Southern managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Norfolk Southern's TSR for the last 5 years was 112%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Norfolk Southern shares lost 8.5% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Norfolk Southern better, we need to consider many other factors.

While you might think the pandemic was the catalyst for Coca-Cola's decision to retire certain brands, it wasn't.Dollar Tree, Dollar General and Family Dollar: Comparing the Discount Chains in Four CategoriesImportant: How To Guard Your Wealth From a Potential Banking Crisis With GoldThe company's plans to tighten up its portfolio were already in motion before the pandemic reared its head in early 2020. However, supply chain issues and altered customer shopping behavior that resulted from the pandemic encouraged Coca-Cola leaders to fast-track those plans.The decision to discontinue certain products is nothing new for Coca-Cola. The company has axed many of its products over the years. In memory, here are 10 Coca-Cola products you can't buy anymore -- some of which were recently removed from the beverage titan's lineup and others that you may have forgotten about.Shutterstock.comTaBTaB, introduced in 1963 as the company's first diet soft drink, was one of the products on Coca-Cola's 2020 hit list. The saccharine-laced beverage's marketing campaign was initially targeted at women and, as a result, TaB reached peak popularity in the 1980s. In the decades that followed, the brand managed to hold onto a much smaller, but impressively loyal, following -- mostly comprised of consumers who remember TaB as a beloved cultural icon.Take Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Shutterstock.comOdwallaWhile juice and smoothie brand Odwalla wasn't originally created by the Coca-Cola company, it had been part of its product lineup since 2001. However, less than two decades later, Coca-Cola added it to its list of discontinued brands. According to CNN, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said that the pandemic wasn't the cause of Odwalla's demise. Instead, the company had noted that health-conscious consumers were simply less interested in smoothies.Story continuesiStock.comZico Coconut WaterLike Odwalla, the Zico brand was not a Coca-Cola original. However, Zico enjoyed a less successful run. Coca-Cola acquired the brand less than a decade ago in 2013. Coca-Cola's decision to cull Zico from its portfolio may have had something to do with its competitor Vita Coco, which has often been recognized as the No. 1 selling coconut water in the U.S. Vita-Coco experienced sales spikes at Costco, Amazon and Walmart following the onset of the pandemic, while Zico remained in Coca-Cola's underperforming category.360b / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola LifeFirst released in Argentina and Chile in 2013, this stevia-sweetened drink containing 89 calories soon made its way to the U.K. in 2014. Within the same year, Coca-Cola Life was rolled out in the U.S. to an enthusiastic market, but by 2016, Bernstein analysts reported the novelty had worn off. Still, Coca-Cola held on to the product, until 2020, when it announced that Coke Life would join its list of underperforming -- aka discontinued -- products.kokkai / Getty ImagesCoca-Cola BlaKIf coffee plus Coke sounds like an intriguing combo, you might've liked Coca-Cola Blak. But the flavor of coke sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, aspartame and acesulfame potassium combined with coffee extract was not for everyone. When the beverage first launched in the U.S. in 2006, Anderson Cooper was guest hosting on ""Live with Regis and Kelly"" and he and Kelly tried it on-air. Cooper spit it out but Kelly liked it, describing it as tasting like a Coke Slurpee from 7-11. In September 2007, Coca-Cola announced it was pulling the hybrid beverage from the U.S. market as soon as the concentrate supplies ran out.OlegDoroshin / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola C2In 2004, Coca-Cola launched C2 to a target market of 20- to 40-year-old males who wanted a unique beverage that tasted like Coke without the calorie and carb load. To get that combination, Coca-Cola couldn't get rid of all the carbs and calories in C2 -- only half. Sadly, the beverage flopped because while it did retain the full flavor of Coke, it didn't live up to the zero-carb, zero-calorie male expectation. About a year later, Coca-Cola did get it right when it introduced current fan-favorite Coke Zero.ablokhin / Getty Images/iStockphotoOK SodaIn 1993, Coca-Cola created OK soda to grab the attention of Generation X -- those born from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s -- based on the assumption that the generation was cynical and disillusioned. The company named the product OK because their research found that while Coke was the second most recognizable word in the world, OK was the first. Plus, the word OK helped the soda underpromise instead of making it seem like the next great thing, which fit in perfectly with its marketing strategy to less-than-trusting Gen Xers. Even though the soda had a national media campaign, the company only tested it in select markets to bolster demand. Unfortunately, sales didn't live up to the hype and OK soda was sent to the chopping block in 1995.Shutterstock.comDiet Coke LimeIn 2018, Diet Coke Lime fans were befuddled when they could no longer find the beverage at their favorite grocery store. The demise of the iconic brand's lime-flavored diet soda was the precursor to the company's release of its new-and-improved lineup of Diet Coke beverages, created to attract millennials, which included exciting new flavors, such as twisted mango, zesty blood orange, feisty cherry and ginger lime.Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comDiet Coke Feisty CherryWhile Diet Coke Feisty Cherry was part of the new-and-improved Diet Coke campaign in 2018, it didn't stand the test of time like the beverage company hoped it would. While it definitely had appeal -- Taste of Home described its flavor as having a more authentic bold cherry taste than the classic cherry Diet Coke -- Coca-Cola decided to opt out and added it to its discontinued list in 2020.Mejini Neskah / Shutterstock.comNew CokeIn 1985, in an attempt to re-energize its brand, Coca-Cola announced the unthinkable: It was changing its formula for its original Coca-Cola for the first time in 99 years. Often referred to as New Coke, the reformulated beverage was met with outrage from consumers who wanted their old Coke back. And 79 days later, Coca-Cola gave consumers their wish. To resolve the situation, Coca-Cola Classic -- aka original Coke -- was sold alongside New Coke, which later was rebranded as Coke II before it was discontinued. But that wasn't the end of New Coke. In 2019, as a result of Coca-Cola's partnership with Netflix's ""Stranger Things,"" which featured New Coke throughout its season three episodes, the beverage company released a limited run of 12-ounce cans of New Coke that were available as part of a bundle from CokeStore.com/1985.More From GOBankingRatesThe 15 Biggest Bank Failures in US HistoryFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tipsTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Coca-Cola Products You Can’t Buy Anymore]"

273,fff147a7-eae5-3105-968d-4e44f448edd5,INTU,2022-11-23,Earnings Preview: Intuit (INTU) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-intuit-intu-q1-150003214.html,1669129203,STORY,['INTU'],"[The market expects Intuit (INTU) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 29, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.5 billion, up 24.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.92% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuit?For Intuit, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuit will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intuit would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.10, delivering a surprise of +12.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Intuit doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The lackluster performance towards the beginning of the year is mainly related to the lingering effects of the pandemic, which has hurt a number of players. Estimates have been increasing since May, as the pandemic recedes. Some companies were however positively impacted by the pandemic and the rush-to-digitize trend that it gave rise to. The diversity of players in this group leads to some dissonance. Being the backbone of the digital economy, it’s hard to see this industry doing badly over the long term. Overall, some of these long-term trends are playing out this year even as concerns of a slowing economy in 2023 looms large. The negative economic indicators, inflation and geopolitical tensions affect most players but some are better equipped than others to deal with the situation. Despite the beating that the industry has taken this year, valuation still looks rich. But this may be just the time to find beaten-down stocks with better staying power or strong long-term potential. Our picks are NetEase (NTES), RingCentral (RNG) and Verisign (VRSN).About The IndustryThe Internet Software &amp; Services industry is a relatively small industry, primarily involved in enabling platforms, networks, solutions and services for online businesses and facilitating customer interaction and use of Internet based services.Top Themes Driving the IndustryThe overall impact of COVID has been mixed for the industry. Although it necessitated work from home for employees, the industry, being by nature tech-centric, had relatively fewer issues with this. On the other hand, business continuity concerns accelerated the shift to cloud-based working for many companies, while service providers, both work-related and otherwise, also moved to Internet-based channels. Another big segment that did humongous amounts of online business was retail. All of these moves were positive for the industry (in terms of revenue) and partially offset the negative impact of declining business at brick-and-mortar players. At least some of the positives will outlive the pandemic. In other cases, the return to physical operations is still ongoing, and hindered by new strains of the virus, inflation and other concerns.Story continues The geopolitical tensions in Europe have a bearing on oil prices and certain supply chains, and therefore, also on large segments of the economy. And most experts fear that the Fed’s actions to contain inflation are pushing us into a recession. Since any improvement in the general level of economic growth improves prospects for the industry, the current environment is contributing to a negative outlook for 2023.  The higher volume of business being operated through the cloud and the increasing demand for enabling software and services involves infrastructure buildout, which increases costs for players. This causes great fluctuations in profitability as new infrastructure is depreciated and fresh debt is serviced. So even for those players that have seen revenue growth accelerate as a result of the pandemic, profitability has remained a challenge. The current inflationary conditions are also a concern. The level of technology adoption by businesses and the proliferation of connected consumer devices that might help people connect and do business online also impacts growth. The high penetration of mobile devices among users and the pandemic-driven necessity is driving more businesses to adopt technology that they earlier stayed away from because of the cost involved. This is positive for the industry.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Improving ProspectsThe Zacks Internet – Software &amp; Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks classified industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that the industry is currently in recovery mode.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is because the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate is improving. The aggregate estimate revisions reflect increased analyst optimism since May and the group’s aggregate earnings are now down just 1.6% over the past year. The 2023 estimate is however still down 35%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry's Stock Market Performance Remains PoorThe past year’s performance of the Zacks Internet – Software &amp; Services Industry shows that it has lagged the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector, as well as the S&amp;P 500 during this period. But while the discount to the S&amp;P 500 is substantial, especially in the last few months, it has traded closer to the sector, which hasn’t had a great run in the face of current macro concerns.The aggregate share price of the industry dropped 50.3% over the past year compared to the broader sector’s decline of 33.6% and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 16.9%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationWhile many of the players are still making losses, the industry as a whole continues to generate profits. Therefore, on the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, we see that the industry is currently trading at a 30.7X multiple, well below its median level of 52.6X over the past year. The S&amp;P 500’s P/E is however just 17.7X (median value over the past year is 17.9X). The industry is also overvalued compared to the sector’s forward-12-month P/E of 21.1X (at its median level over the past year).The industry has traded in the annual range of 75.1X to 29.0X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks Worth ConsideringNetEase, Inc.

(RNG): Belmont, CA-based RingCentral provides software-as-a-service solutions that enable North American businesses to communicate, collaborate and connect. The company offers business cloud communications and contact center solutions. It caters to a enterprises, SMBs, professionals and others across a broad range of industries including financial services, education, healthcare, legal services, real estate, retail, technology, insurance, construction, hospitality, and state and local government.RingCentral is growing on the back of a several megatrends, including the pandemic-induced shift to hybrid work, the increasing adoption of mobility solutions by businesses and the increasingly distributed workforces, all of which are leading to the increased need for unified communications and contact center solutions. When these are cloud-enabled, the whole thing is better integrated, more secure, more efficient and cost efficient. With an ecosystem of over 75,000 developers, over 150 pre-built telephony apps and over 330 pre-built apps as unified communications and contact center solutions, it is no surprise that Gartner has RingCentral in the leadership quadrant of its latest report. The company is already generating a recurring revenue run rate of $2 billion and looks set to easily eclipse that next year.All this doesn’t of course doesn’t mean that the company is not seeing the economic slowdown and labor cost inflation that the rest of the market is seeing. Management has been rationalizing the workforce to align it with the changing market scenario. But it doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a rapidly expanding market the world over with a very low (single-digit) penetration rate, according to Synergy Research. Additionally, Synergy estimates that RingCentral is the leader in UCaaS with over 20% market share based on paid seats, which is double the second and third place vendors. So, there is tremendous scope for growth.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company are down 83.5% over the past year. Its 2022 estimate is up 4 cents (2.1%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate is up 28 cents (11.2%) during the same time period.Price and Consensus: RNGZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVeriSign, Inc.

The steady nature of the business that is tied to digital transformation leads to relatively steady cash flows. However, like every other company, rising costs, the broader economic slowdown and weaker business in China are also weighing on it.

282,b6e4b325-6ced-38bc-b958-bfe47922e4d8,SRE,2022-11-23,Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) investors will be pleased with their respectable 56% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempras-nyse-sre-investors-pleased-142449461.html,1669127089,STORY,['SRE'],"[The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Sempra (NYSE:SRE) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 33% over five years, which is below the market return. However, more recent buyers should be happy with the increase of 27% over the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Sempra There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Sempra managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.7% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Sempra has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Sempra, it has a TSR of 56% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Sempra has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 31% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 9%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Sempra (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

283,5e719595-1082-331f-99dc-bcf824198ba1,SRE,2022-11-23,7 Utility Stocks to Buy Heading Into December 2022,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-utility-stocks-buy-heading-200412741.html,1668888252,STORY,"['SRE', 'GNE-PA', 'YORW', 'OTTR', 'DUK', 'CIG-C']","[With macroeconomic pressures weighing heavily on market sentiment, investors should play it (relatively) safe with utility stocks to buy. Fundamentally, these energy and resource service providers represent an indelible demand structure. No matter how advanced we become as a society, humans have basic needs that must be fulfilled.Moreover, utility stocks to buy essentially tie into monopolistic business structures. Unlike other sectors, the barrier to entry in this field is incredibly steep. Un7less people at scale plan on living off grid, they must pay whatever company covers their area. In other words, the utilities enjoy a hostage audience.Another factor that keeps the lights on for utility stocks to buy centers on the trade-down effect. Typically, consumers facing financial pressures will trade down products or services to increasingly cheaper alternatives. However, in most cases, no alternatives exist for utilities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s awfully cynical but that’s the deal. So, below are seven utility stocks to buy.DUKDuke Energy$96.79DDominion Energy$59.16SRESempra Energy$157.84YORWYork Water$44.66OTTROtter Tail$55.97GNEGenie Energy$9.90CIGEnergy Company of Minas Gerais$1.92Duke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is an electric power and natural gas holding firm. Its electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. On a year-to-date basis, DUK gave up nearly 8% of equity value. Though not good, on a relative basis, it’s certainly not bad.Fundamentally, Duke benefits from migration trends. For instance, its home state of North Carolina represents an attractive region for young people. More recently, a local newspaper noted that millennials have begun flocking to Raleigh. While Duke will always make money, it’s also positioned to advantage demographic growth.Story continuesAs well, investors should consider DUK as one of the utility stocks to buy for its passive income. Per Dividend.com, the company offers a forward yield of 4.21%. This ranks higher than the sector average yield of 3.75%. Additionally, the company features 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will not give up easily.Dominion Energy (D)The logo for Dominion Energy (D) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Felix Mizioznikov / Shutterstock.comA power and energy firm located in Richmond, Virginia, Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) also benefits from millennial migration trends. Per its public profile, the company provides electricity services to parts of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and supplies natural gas to parts of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.Now, it’s possible to have lengthy discussions about each of these states and what they offer for millennials seeking lower costs of living. However, I’m going to point out Utah. For one thing, Utah attracts young people for more reasonable housing costs. In addition, the state provides a robust environment for businesses, perfect for the burgeoning gig economy.Similar to Duke above, Dominion ranks among the utility stocks to buy because of its passive income potential. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 4.57%. Again, that’s noticeably higher than the sector average. In addition, the payout ratio is 61.41%, which while on the high side is still reasonable in terms of sustainability.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comLife isn’t fair and Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) (perhaps more so than any other utility stocks to buy) drives this point home. Based in San Diego, California, Sempra covers the lucrative Southern California market. As you probably, the Golden State represents the economic engine of the U.S., pumping out a GDP of $3.3 trillion.Why is this important for SRE stock? Well, no matter what experts (and politicians) say about people rushing for the exits to the safe haven of Arizona, Texas or what have you, California represents a coastal state with warm-water ports. Therefore, this state will always be relevant and frankly, will always be the most important to the U.S.Logically, then, this dynamic gives Sempra incredible leverage. The company’s core consumer base (generally speaking) are wealthier than average. So, folks have no choice but to pay up. No one said you have to like it but it’s just the harsh reality.York Water (YORW)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comAn investor-owned, public utility company operating in Pennsylvania, York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) serves an estimated population of 190,000 through approximately 66,000 service connections across 48 municipalities. Certainly, it’s not the sexiest name among utility stocks to buy (not that this sector appeals in that manner). However, for slow-and-steady reliability, few investments rank above YORW.Indeed, York Water offers a small piece of American history. Per its public profile, the company carries the distinction of the oldest investor-owned utility in the nation. It also has the longest record of consecutive dividends since 1816. You know who served as POTUS at the time? James Monroe, the fifth president and the last from the Founding Fathers.That’s neither here nor there other than to say that management surely wants to keep this prestigious status alive. Currently, York Water features a forward yield of 1.77%. Though lower than the sector average, its payout ratio of 54.52% makes the dividends more sustainable than others.Otter Tail (OTTR)electricity pylons and lines at duskSource: snvv18870020330 / Shutterstock.comFor the final three ideas among utility stocks to buy, I’m going to take the path less traveled, beginning with Otter Tail (NASDAQ:OTTR). Based out of Minnesota, Otter Tail is an energy firm which serves at least 423 towns at retail and delivers power to about 14 municipal utilities. Since the start of the year, OTTR dropped over 21% of equity value, making it a risky idea.However, contrarians might see an upside opportunity with OTTR. Mainly, the company enjoys solid income-statement-related metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.6%, ranked higher than 63% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at nearly 20%, which ranks better than almost 85% against its peers.If that wasn’t enough, OTTR trades at 7.9-times trailing-12-month earnings and 12-times forward earnings. Both metrics rate as conspicuously undervalued relative to the industry. Finally, Otter provides a forward yield of just under 3% against a relatively low payout ratio of 43.57%.Genie Energy (GNE)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Newark, New Jersey, Genie Energy (NYSE:GNE) is a domestic retail provider of green and conventional electricity and natural gas supply. As well, it provides on-site and community solar energy solutions, with a focus on deregulated markets across the nation. Thanks to its relevant fundamentals, GNE skyrocketed so far this year, gaining over 71% of equity value.To be fair, the enormous upside mobility of GNE might not make it everyone’s cup of tea. Let’s face it – utility stocks to buy don’t own a reputation for high-flying share performance. At the same time, the company enjoys stout financials. For instance, Genie carries zero debt on its books. That could come in handy should we encounter choppier-than-expected economic waves.As well, GNE benefits from strong income-related performances. Both its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate and net margins rank among the underlying sector’s elite firms. Also, the company provides a forward yield of 3.1%.Energy Company of Minas Gerais (CIG)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA Brazilian power firm, Energy Company of Minas Gerais (NYSE:CIG) almost certainly does not represent everyone’s cup of tea. For one thing, when faced with global recessionary pressures, it’s probably best for investors to seek shelter at home. Another factor to consider focuses on the CIG’s price point. Trading hands at less than $2 a share, CIG represents one of the speculative ideas among utility stocks to buy.However, those that don’t mind taking some potshots can take comfort in Energy Company’s financial profile. Primarily, CIG benefits from a strong sales trek, as evidenced by its three-year revenue growth rate of nearly 19%. This ranks above 89% of the competition. Further, the energy specialist’s return on equity pings at 14.45%, reflecting a quality business.Unlike the other utility stocks to buy on this list, Energy Company presently does not pay a dividend. Still, if you want to roll the dice on a low-price utility, CIG might be your opportunity.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned +17.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, to which GE belongs, has gained 11.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share, indicating a change of +21.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.8%. This estimate has changed -5.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.27 indicates a change of +68% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GE is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of GE, the consensus sales estimate of $21.88 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.8%. The $75.86 billion and $81.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $19.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.26%. The EPS surprise was -25.53%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

New deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings will likely be major tailwinds.Story continuesMoreover, using advanced technology, market-leading health analytics, modern care delivery and data-driven population health approaches are likely to lend Optum a long runway for growth. The improvement of the domestic economy is likely to support UNH’s commercial business recovery. This will boost the number of people served with domestic commercial benefit insurance offerings.Rising memberships are likely to help its premium collection and service fees. Our estimate suggests 2022 premiums to rise 12.9% while service revenues are expected to jump 10.7%. Also, improving efficiency will play a major role in improving margins. Our estimate for the UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio of 82% indicates a significant improvement from 2021 actuals.UNH’s balance sheet strength will allow it to continue taking expansionary steps. It exited the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of around $42.5 billion, way above the short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt of $3.2 billion. During the first nine months of 2022, UnitedHealth generated operating cash flows of $30.7 billion, which increased from the prior-year comparable period’s $19.1 billion.RisksHowever, there are a few factors that might impede the stock’s growth.Increasing costs might eat into its profits. We expect its total operating costs and expenses to increase 11.5% in 2022, on the back of higher medical costs and costs of products sold. Also, membership from international business is declining, which might strain the membership growth prospects of UnitedHealth. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Elevance Health Inc. ELV, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN and Inventiva S.A. IVA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Elevance Health’s full-year earnings is currently pegged at $29.01 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 11.7%.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Estée Lauder Companies hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Estée Lauder Companies will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Estée Lauder Companies' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 27%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 18% in total. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been mostly respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Estée Lauder Companies' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Estée Lauder Companies' P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.We've established that Estée Lauder Companies maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Plus, you should also learn about these   2 warning signs we've spotted with Estée Lauder Companies.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20x).Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The red, plum and pink-beige shades were released to directly benefit the HIV and AIDS charity drive (with none other than RuPaul fronting the posters), and MAC has been donating 100% of the retail price (minus VAT) to LGBTQ+ communities ever since.They say it's more like donating to charity and getting a free lipstick in return, rather than buying a standard lippie. To date, hundreds of millions of pounds has been donated worldwide by the makeup brand.Somewhere along the way however, in the glitz of celebrity campaign collaborations (with the likes of Lady Gaga, Elton John, and Debbie Harry), the charity message got lost - as many as 85% of MAC customers are unaware of what Viva Glam is.Now the brand wants to reclaim that message by foregoing a celebrity face this World AIDS Day and instead extending their charitable pledge across all of their lipsticks - not just Viva Glam shades - on December 1.Continue reading here.M·A·C Cosmetics, Tuesday, November 22, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from M·A·C Cosmetics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: M·A·C CosmeticsWebsite: profiles/mac-cosmeticsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: M·A·C CosmeticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727728/How-a-Lipstick-Can-Change-a-Life]"

This is especially true as the holiday-shortened week is usually a bullish feast for stock investors, even with low volumes, as consumer spending is expected to rise.Consumer spending is likely to reach $125 billion, up 10% year over year, this Thanksgiving weekend despite higher inflation and higher interest rates. This would propel the economy and stocks higher.To tap the trend, investors could reap solid gains by investing in stocks of the industries likely to benefit the most this week. Some of these are Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, Dillard's DDS, American Airlines Group AAL, Canadian National Railway CNI and MakeMyTrip Limited MMYT.These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a Growth Score of B or better.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Solid Historical TrendsWhile elevated inflation, Fed’s aggressive rate hike and recession fears have been playing foul on the stock market, higher consumer spending should provide a boost to the stocks this week. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the Thanksgiving week has returned modest gains for stocks dating back to 1945.Researchers say that since then, the entire week of Thanksgiving has averaged a 60-basis-point gain for the S&amp;P 500, with the best returns coming on Wednesday before the holiday and Black Friday and the only decline on average on Monday at the start of the week.Per researchers, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 0.54% on average during the week over the past 50 years, with 68% of the returns coming in positive.Bright SpotsAccording to the National Retail Federation, a record 166.3 million people are planning to shop from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday this year. This represents 8 million more people than last year and is the highest estimate since NRF began tracking this data in 2017.Story continuesAmericans will spend $125 billion, up 10% from last year. About 89% of consumers expect to shop in the period beginning Thanksgiving Day and ending Cyber Monday, despite concerns of  inflation and rising interest rates.Black Friday continues to be the most popular shopping day, with 69% planning to splurge, followed by 38% on Cyber Monday. Among the 114.9 million Black Friday shoppers, 67% say they expect to head to stores, up from 64% in 2021.Online search (43%) remains the most popular source of gift inspiration, followed by friends and family (35%), and within a retail store (31%). The top five gift categories that consumers plan to give are clothing (55%), followed by gift cards at 45%, toys at 37%, books/music/movies/video games at 33%, and food/candy at 31%.Travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA) expects 2022 to be the third-busiest Thanksgiving travel season in the United States over the last two decades.About 54.6 million people will travel 50 miles or more from home this Thanksgiving.

Of them, 49 million (up 0.4% from the last year) will go on road trips, 4.5 million (up 8%) will fly, and the remaining 1.4 million (up 23%) will travel by train, bus or cruise.However, Americans are bracing for a costly Thanksgiving this year, with double-digit percent increases in the price of turkey, potatoes, stuffing, canned pumpkin and other staples. The average cost of serving 10 people for Thanksgiving is expected to be $64.05 (or less than $6.50 per person), up 20% from last year’s average of $53.31, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual Thanksgiving dinner cost survey.

Given this backdrop, Federal Realty FRT is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets in the United States.This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) properties are located in the first ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, mainly in the key coastal markets from Washington DC to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The strong demographics and infill nature of its properties allow Federal Realty to enjoy high occupancy.The company has a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including TJX Companies, Kroger and CVS Corporation. This minimizes the risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues.Federal Realty’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Moreover, Federal Realty’s expansion efforts into the premium markets and initiatives to redevelop and reposition its assets seem encouraging.On the balance-sheet front, Federal Realty exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $ $146.2 million. In October 2022, it increased the borrowing capacity of its revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion, giving it enough financial flexibility.Further, its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market. With strong balance-sheet strength, FRT is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Analysts seem bullish about the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved marginally upward over the past week, indicating a favorable outlook for FRT.Shares of Federal Realty have gained 19.8% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry’s growth of 17.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is concerning for Federal Realty. Online retailing will likely remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.A slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings amid an inflationary environment and interest rate hikes could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters.Also, rising interest rates might increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regency Centers’ current-year FFO per share is currently pegged at $3.97.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory Outlet Centers’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has presently stands at $1.80.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Assets Trust’s 2022 FFO per share is pegged at $2.26, presently.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) and The Walt Disney Company (DIS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;AbbVie’s shares have handily outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+35.9% vs. +13.4%) on the back of favorable outlook for its cancer drugs and pipeline of drugs. The company has successfully expanded the labels of its cancer drugs, Imbruvica and Venclexta. It has several new drugs in its portfolio, which have the potential to drive revenues once Humira loses U.S. exclusivity in 2023.Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by the approval in new indications. It has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential.However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth once Humira generics enter the U.S. market. Increasing competition from newer therapies is hurting Imbruvica’s sales. Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressures is affecting sales of the aesthetics franchise.(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PepsiCo have modestly outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+12.6% vs. +11.1%). The company’s revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year in the third quarter. This marked the 17th straight quarter of sales beat.PepsiCo benefits from the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit by delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. It raised its revenue view for 2022.However, PepsiCo witnessed margin pressures in the third quarter driven by impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. PEP anticipates incremental input cost inflation for the balance of 2022. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Walt Disney shares have reacted favorably to the leadership change announcement, but the stock has otherwise been laggard (down -38.6% vs. -18.3% for the S&amp;P 500 index). The company’s profitability was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney’s leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results reflected strength in Disney+ and revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses. The company benefits from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks. Per capita spending increased 6% year over year, while occupancy at domestic hotels was 90% in the fiscal fourth quarter.(You can read the full research report on The Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Caterpillar Inc.

305,fdf46dcd-9647-3934-89f2-8f4885a44fd0,PEP,2022-11-23,The 25 Best Stocks to Buy for Retirement,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-best-stocks-buy-retirement-205410966.html,1668891250,STORY,"['MCD', 'GOOGL', 'CROX', 'TXN', 'NFLX', 'WBA', 'SHOP', 'META', 'PEP']","[The stock market is on a long-term downtrend as interest rates rise and inflation remains high despite a slight cool-off. Many retirement portfolios that invest in indexes such as S&amp;P500 are down at least 17% year-to-date. That is even more awful when you add inflation to the equation.Of course, no stock is immune to the downturn we currently face. Still, some stocks on the market are highly resistant to recessionary and inflationary pressures, and they have the historical performance to back that claim. There are also some highly oversold stocks with little room for more downside. Buying them now could pay dividends for decades, as market downturns have always been the best time to buy any stock.Buying when everyone is selling pays off in the long run. It isn’t a coincidence that most well-known and respected investors are contrarians. Thus, if you are looking for a retirement portfolio that you wish to hold for the long term, now is the time to buy these discounted stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI believe the following 25 are among the best stocks to buy for retirement:McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)GlobalF0undries (NASDAQ:GFS)Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)Merck (NYSE:MRK)O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY)Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)Walmart (NYSE:WMT)Costco (NASDAQ:COST)TJX (NYSE:TJX)Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO)Veritiv Corp. (NYSE:VRTV)Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B)McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a very recession-resistant stock and is one of the few stocks to have increased in value during the great recession. Even in 2020, MCD recovered very quickly despite being a restaurant chain, one of the worst affected sectors of the economy. Simply put, McDonald’s thrives in an environment of economic uncertainty. It is a solid business in a consistent long-term uptrend, making it a perfect stock if you wish to avoid volatility.Story continuesIt is also a business that will stay relevant for a lifetime. My colleague Larry Ramer notes the following:“…MCD has become such a core part of American culture — and consequently a magnet for lovers of American culture in much of the rest of the world — that its business is sure to thrive for decades to come.”Moreover, the financials are stable, and McDonald’s has an annual dividend yield of 2.2%, strengthening the argument to buy it for the long term.There is also a misconception that McDonald’s being a consumer discretionary business will make it vulnerable to economic turmoil. I’m afraid I have to disagree since previous recessions have proved quite the opposite. As higher-income customers start feeling the pinch, they start eating more at McDonald’s, causing the business to thrive.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockIf you want something more diversified, look into PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The company’s diversification strategy makes it a very stable business. Not only that, PepsiCo is diversified into many consumer staples brands, making its revenue sources very inelastic and resistant to economic downturns. Like McDonald’s, PepsiCo is on a solid footing and will remain relevant for decades. The company’s financials will reflect just that as it is on a stable, long-term uptrend, with revenue reaching $83.6 billion TTM in the last quarter, up 8.8% year-on-year. Moreover, PepsiCo has an annual dividend yield of 2.56% and reported a net income growth of 21.5%. With robust top-line and bottom-line growth, PEP is undoubtedly among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Needless to say, PEP stock won’t give you multibagger returns, but it will certainly protect your assets and counteract inflation. It’s the perfect asset to hold if you simply wish to ride out the storm.Shopify (SHOP)Shopify Inc (SHOP) Stock’s Earnings Dip Is a Chance to Buy!Source: ShutterstockShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is a Canadian e-commerce platform that rose rapidly after the pandemic. From Feb. 2020 to its peak in Nov. 2021, SHOP stock grew by 218%, but it has had a dreadful year in 2022. YTD, the stock is down just slightly above 70%. However, the trend seems to be reversing as it is up 56% from its bottom of $25.6 after beating Q3 expectations.Its top line grew at 21.6% in Q3, beating expectations by 2.3%, while its losses also beat expectations. That is great for the stock, as robust top-line growth will encourage SHOP to be valued at a higher premium.Shopify has had exceptionally robust top-line growth since its IPO, and its elevated valuation throughout 2021 was due to its YoY revenue growth of nearly 100%. With the same metric on the march higher, investors won’t mind paying more for the stock. The Bank of Canada also hints at lower interest rate hikes as the economy cools off.With those factors in mind, the outlook seems promising for Shopify going forward. I would not be surprised if the company delivered a net profit very soon, as its losses are at $158 million from $1.2 billion in Q2.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a stock many investors view negatively due to the metaverse project going poorly. The stock is down more than 65% YTD as Meta spends extravagantly on a project only a handful of people are excited about, and it’s not something many would consider among the best stocks to buy for retirement.However, I am not at all convinced that Meta will be a failed company. The metaverse may seem silly today, as it is in the very early phases of development, but there is no guarantee that it cant still turn out to be profitable a decade or so down the line. It simply might be ahead of the curve.Let’s look at a prediction from 2010:“Tens of millions of Americans will be using a social networking site far more flexible and useful and far less annoying than Facebook today. It may or may not be a vastly improved version of Facebook itself, but having a page on it will be as useful and nearly as common as having a phone. (80% of readers agree).”Twelve years later, Facebook is still the most used social media platform if you exclude YouTube. However, even if the metaverse does fail, a $700 billion-plus decline in valuation for the company seems too overdone. We’re talking about a company that owns Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger called the “Family of Apps.” All combined, it generated nearly $32 billion in operating profits in the first three quarters this year. In contrast, Meta lost a little above $9.4 billion this year from Reality Labs. That’s far from being unsustainable.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another tech stock battered by the bear market. Down 48% YTD, it has pulled off a strong recovery after introducing more revenue sources and improving its monthly active user (or MAU) count. Despite the recent surge in its price, it is still a stock with much more upside in the future due to slowing but consistent revenue growth and steady subscriber count.I argue that NFLX stock seems very oversold when comparing the stock price to pre-pandemic metrics. In Q4 2019, Netflix’s subscriber count was 167 million, and quarterly revenue was at $5.5 billion. The stock price then was around $320. Fast forward to Q3 2022, with the subscriber count at 223 million and revenue at almost $8 billion. The only thing that hasn’t changed much is NFLX’s price.Of course, one might argue that its 30%-plus top-line growth back then contributed greatly towards Netflix’s valuation. Admittedly, it has slowed down a lot. But investors should also remember the massive boost Netflix got from the pandemic. It is quite surprising that revenue isn’t plunging but still growing at a slower pace, and Netflix has retained most of its pandemic customers. The stock’s price chart says very well that investors are quickly regaining faith.Texas Instruments (TXN), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and GlobalFoundries (GFS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), and GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) are semiconductor manufacturing stocks and follow a similar trajectory. Although the past few months have been terrible for these stocks, the trend is starting to reverse, and they’re becoming very good buying opportunities.Admittedly, I was pessimistic about semiconductor stocks after the demand for GPUs fell. However, all of them have beaten their revenue expectations and continue to grow. For example, TSM’s revenue growth has surpassed even 2021 metrics, and even Warren Buffet is buying after the news.While TSM stock surges higher due to demand, I also expect GFS and TXN stocks to be great long-term bets. They could even outperform Taiwan Semiconductor due to the CHIPS act. They are both American companies that qualify for billions in subsidies.Of course, these stocks naturally move with the rest of the market and could see more downside. However, if you are looking to hold long-term, Semiconductor stocks are among the best stocks to buy for retirement. Texas Instruments, Taiwan Semiconductor, and GlobalFoundries reported YoY top-line growth at 13%, 36%, and 22%, respectively. Those are robust numbers that’ll make these stocks continue to trade at a premium.Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are considered semiconductor stocks, they do not manufacture a meaningful amount of semiconductors. Instead, they design semiconductors and manufacture them through partners such as TSMC. They produce and sell a variety of technological products.These stocks have outstanding financials and are undervalued despite the recent stock market rally. Broadcom has revenue growing at 25% YoY. The robust growth should cause AVGO stock to trade at higher levels in the long run. On the other hand, Qualcomm is even more undervalued, with a price-earnings ratio of 11x and 22% YoY quarterly revenue growth.Conversely, these stocks won’t technically qualify for the CHIPS act as they don’t manufacture their own chips. However, their growth is robust enough to make this list among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is undoubtedly among the best stocks to buy for retirement, as the Internet is incomplete without this company. As many of my colleagues have already pointed out, Alphabet owns the two most popular websites on the internet: Google.com and YouTube.com. With GOOG and GOOGL stock declining 32-plus YTD, I consider Google a low-risk, high-reward investment.GOOG and GOOGL stock trading below $100 is a once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity. Alphabet is an evergreen business that is arguably the best tech stock to buy for long-term gains. Sure, its bottom line has declined quite a lot due to the fall in advertising revenue, but the economy will inevitably roar back, and so will Alphabet’s ad sales.Gurufocus.com reinforces my view about Alphabet, rating GOOGL as “Significantly Undervalued” with a price target of $140. That’s a 42% upside. By 2026, we could be looking at nearly 100% upside on average.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another evergreen tech stock that is among the best stocks to buy for retirement. If you are a white-collar worker, you are almost guaranteed to have used a Microsoft product. You might even be reading this article on the Windows operating system. My argument is that this company is essential for most people and won’t be going under the radar anytime soon. It’s elusive at best to run a business without any Microsoft products.The company appeals to individual and corporate customers with a vast range of products. Microsoft has Bing, Edge, Windows, Office, Outlook, Skype, Teams, OneDrive, cloud services, and even games. That’s just software. It also sells many hardware products such as computers, computer accessories, Xboxes, Xbox accessories, and networking hardware. This mega-cap simply has too much potential not to be included in a retirement portfolio.In addition, the market downturn has made MSFT decline by 28% YTD and presents a very attractive buying opportunity at $240 per share. Much like Alphabet, Microsoft’s net income has also shrunk, albeit slightly less, as it does not depend too much on ad revenue. However, its top line still grew by double digits, and Microsoft plans for more layoffs to increase its profitability. Finally, the stock also has an annual dividend yield of 1.1%, which will add to any long-term gains.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is among the best stocks to buy for retirement as it lingers at $40 per share despite a promising outlook. The company is a retail pharmacy business, which much more inelastic than some of the tech companies I’ve mentioned above.The past few years have not been good for WBA stock, as it is down nearly 60% since its peak in 2015. Its share prices in 2022 are also the same as in 2001. With that in mind, it is easy to see why WBA is trading at a PE ratio of just under 8x. Moreover, its financials did outdo expectations, but the metrics are on a downtrend.Conversely, my argument for putting WBA stock on this list is due to its long-term expansion plans. The company’s management is steering Walgreens towards a healthcare business in addition to a retail one. It invested $5.2 billion in VillageMD last year, planning to offer full-service primary care with primary care physicians and pharmacists in one place. The company is planning 1,000 such locations by 2027. VillageMD itself is also planning an IPO, a company in which Walgreens Boots Alliance has a 63% stake.Furthermore, Walgreens Boots Alliance is a dividend aristocrat yielding 4.75%. Combined with its promising prospects and a low earnings multiple, I see the stock price being much higher in a few years.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a must-buy for any retirement portfolio due to the business’s relevancy. AAPL outperformed most other tech stocks and continues to beat expectations due to its products being in high demand. Not only that, the company is still hiring and expanding its workforce while most other tech companies are cutting back.Many people still have money, especially the wealthy who love Apple products, so it’s not hard to see why the company continues to be resilient. Its top and bottom line grew 8.1% and 0.8% YoY in Q3, and its fundamentals are solid.On the contrary, I do have some concerns about AAPL’s short-term value due to declining profit margins. The stock could be in for a correction once the rate hikes start to fully impact the economy and earnings take a hit. It is a well-known fact that markets bottom a few months before a recession ends; thus, if we are still in one, there could be more pain ahead. However, AAPL is still a steal at this price if you are investing for the long term.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIf you are looking for more stability, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is something you should consider in your portfolio. Don’t get me wrong; Big Blue isn’t something that will give you much upside as it’s struggling to retain its earnings and has been outperformed by the broader stock market for the past decade. What it will give you, though, is exceptional stability and a healthy dividend yield.Moreover, it is slowly starting to turn a corner by shaping the business around cloud computing, AI, and even a blockchain platform. If it continues its transition, IBM might no longer be an aging company a few years later.We are already seeing this transition pay off, as its hybrid cloud segment is becoming the driving factor of IBM’s growth. In Q3, the hybrid cloud segment had a revenue growth of 15%. In comparison, software and consulting grew at 7% and 5%, respectively. Moreover, the Q3 earnings report surpassed expectations, and IBM looks like a bargain among the best stocks to buy for retirement, considering its non-GAAP earnings multiple. These positive tailwinds can steadily carry this stock higher.Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comAs Merck (NYSE:MRK) steadily trends higher despite broader economic headwinds, it is becoming an attractive buy for retirement portfolios. The company has robust top-line growth of 13.7%, an attractive dividend yield of 2.65%, and a compelling PE ratio of 16.9x. Furthermore, it is also a pharmaceutical company, an industry with very little price elasticity. Therefore, in the case of a recession, MRK stock is unlikely to disappoint.Furthermore, Merck is partnering up with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) to develop a melanoma vaccine jointly. With more than 1.4 million Americans living with melanoma and nearly 100,000 being diagnosed yearly, this vaccine will be a great source of profit for both companies.Simply put, there is not much else to say about MRK except that it is a fairly valued stock that’ll give you stable returns for the foreseeable future. Its financials are on a solid footing, and I expect it to continue on its steady uptrend. The dividend is the icing on the cake, making MRK among the best stocks to buy for retirement.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Mechanic Working Under Vehicle in a Car ServiceSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is another solid stock for your retirement portfolio. This company is an auto parts retailer that operates 5,911 stores in the U.S. and continues to expand despite broader economic headwinds.The biggest factor positively impacting O’Reilly Automotive is that Americans are holding on to their aging vehicles for much longer. The average age of cars in the U.S. increased to 13.1 years in 2022, and that uptrend will continue as the economy cools off. As a result, business is booming for O’Reilly as more people require vehicle maintenance.In Q3, the company reported stellar earnings beating earnings-per-share estimates by 7.8%. The top line is also up 9.2% YoY. Up 18% this year, a market downturn is nowhere to be seen for ORLY. This business has almost everything going right for it, and if the company improves its profit margin in the future, we are looking at a lot of gains.Crocs (CROX)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is surging higher after a 73% decline from its peak. The company’s Q3 earnings report beat EPS by 13.7% and revenue by 4.4% and is now nothing short of a bargain. YTD, CROX is still down 28%, but I believe it will trend much higher in the long term as the business has some positive tailwinds to consider.I wrote the following about Crocs in May this year: “The stock seems oversold as its value has declined over 70% after the company announced its acquisition of HEYDUDE for $2.5 billion. Crocs remains among the most popular brands for teens despite the company’s recent downturn. Crocs’ recent earnings report was unsatisfactory due to its net income decline. However, its P/E ratio remains low, and the company’s high revenue growth can still make it profitable. Once supply chain disruptions ease, CROX stock will likely deliver a strong recovery from its current downturn.”It is now halfway through Nov. and the stock is up more than 78%, has returned to profitability, and is delivering a strong recovery from its downturn. I believe there are still more gains in the long term.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comIf Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were an e-commerce pure-play, I would not be putting it on this list of the best stocks to buy for retirement, as Shopify would be a much better pick. However, Amazon is diversified enough to remain a relevant business for decades, and investors should consider adding AMZN to their retirement portfolios.Amazon has a lot of promising segments that can drive growth once the economy roars back. This includes Amazon Web Services (or AWS), which dominates the cloud computing segment; Twitch, the most popular live streaming platform; Audible, Alexa, and a lot more. Both its top and bottom lines are making a turnaround on a quarterly basis while the stock price is at pre-pandemic levels. The stock is down 48% this year, and now is a good time to start buying if you wish to hold for the long term.Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and TJX (TJX)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockWalmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), and TJX (NYSE:TJX) are three retail stocks I’d recommend adding to your retirement portfolio for more stability. Except for COST, both WMT and TJX stocks are up this year and have resisted the volatility in the market quite well. Of course, these stocks could be in for a correction if the downturn deepens, but they are great bets for long-term resilience.Inflation is starting to cool, but without a Fed U-turn, there is still a significant risk of a recession. Thus, retail stocks shouldn’t be left out of your portfolio. For a retirement portfolio, Walmart and TJX have much more going for them than Costco. TJX and Walmart are the most undervalued of the three, with PE ratios of just under 23x, much less than Costco’s 36x. For TJX, that comes with a top-line miss this quarter, while Walmart suffers from an inventory glut.Costco is swapping hands at a much higher premium due to its higher revenue growth. It certainly has robust financials that appeal to defensive investors, but COST is starting to look a little too expensive. On the contrary, it has historically outperformed both WMT and TJX, which is why I still think Costco is among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Flowers Foods (FLO)bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display caseSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphotoFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) produces and markets packed bakery food. It has solid fundamentals and has been reporting double-digit revenue growth in the last three-quarters of this year while many other companies are slowing down.Top-line growth accelerated to 12.7%, beating expectations by 1.5%, while EPS grew 5.6%, beating forecasts. The only significant metric that is down is its profit margins, similar to most companies on this list. However, that is to be expected due to high inflation causing margin compression.Flowers Foods has been on a steady long-term uptrend for the last two decades averaging a 10.8% annual return. It is an exceptionally stable stock that closely resembles the S&amp;P500 index in gains but not so much during market downturns. In the past five years, FLO stock has gained 46% against the S&amp;P500’s 52%, but it is significantly outperforming the index YTD. In 2022, it has gained 3.3%, while the S&amp;P500 has shed 17.7%.Furthermore, this stock also has a compelling 3.1% dividend yield, making it among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Veritiv Corp (VRTV)Source: ShutterstockDespite growing 400%-plus in the last five years, 8%-plus this year, and having robust financials, Veritiv (NYSE:VRTV) trades at a very deep discount of 6 times earnings. This business-to-business provider is seeing its profits increase rapidly and reported a 142.5% YoY net income growth in Q3.Of course, packaging firms aren’t among the economy’s growth drivers, which is why VRTV stock often falls under the radar. Firms like Veritiv are expected to grow around 4% CAGR this decade. However, Veritiv offers what most investors are looking for in 2022, which is value. Per forecasts, the exceptional growth rate will likely slow down next year, but the stock will stay deeply undervalued. That makes it among the best stocks to buy for retirement.Finally, the downside risk is quite low here as it is already trading at quite a discount, but it is still one of the riskier market ideas on this list. I expect a strong upside for this company as inflation cools down and supply chain issues wane. But I won’t recommend allocating too much of your portfolio to this stock.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)Warren Buffet Stocks: a picture of warren buffett smiling.Source: Kent Sievers / Shutterstock.comWriting about the best retirement stocks to buy, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is a must. The Oracle of Omaha is arguably the best investor to follow if you are looking for long-term gains, and the best way to do it is by buying Berkshire Hathaway. The company’s portfolio is highly diversified, with almost $300 billion worth of assets under management covering almost every industry.The stock is on a long-term stable uptrend, and I see the growth continuing for the foreseeable future as Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in many essential businesses that’ll stay relevant for decades. That includes many businesses hand-picked by Warren Buffet himself.Sure, the recent market downturn has increased its losses by quite a lot. But Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on an abundance of cash at $109 billion. That is a lot of cushion going forward that the company can use for stock buybacks and covering losses. Furthermore, the top line continues to grow alongside many of the company’s businesses. Most notably, insurance contributes 27% of the company’s revenues, a very inelastic segment.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

309,4d487e21-c4f0-3591-8eaa-81f3849a8ba9,GPS,2022-11-23,What Gap needs to do to save the brand,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gap-needs-save-brand-150408897.html,1669129448,VIDEO,['GPS'],"[Yahoo Finance Live’s Brian Sozzi provides his take on whether or not Gap will be able to recover this holiday season.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: It has been a tough year for Brian Sozzi's favorite retail brands, like Gap.BRIAN SOZZI: Not my favorite.JULIE HYMAN: And Gap shares are down nearly 2% this year. And just last week, the company painted a cloudy picture for the holiday season. I think someone is teasing you a little bit, Sozz.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, this is not one of my favorite brands. I want to make that perfectly clear. I mean, following this company has been just-- it's just abysmal the past decade. But nonetheless, I caught up yesterday for our Rocking Retail special. We spent the whole-- about an hour, over an hour over at Oculus in New York City. And we caught up with Mickey Drexler. He's the former, I would say iconic, the iconic CEO of Gap that put that company on the map. So I asked him what he thinks about Gap right now. It's a company in turmoil, closing hundreds of stores, also looking for a permanent CEO.MICKEY DREXLER: They should look like Gap looks. I think it's a great opportunity to be the all-American uniform-ish with very fair prices and with good-looking clothes, lots of color. But everyone needs to look good. And, you know, I think they'll do much better.BRIAN SOZZI: So I'll pick up the baton where my buddy Mickey left off. He knows a lot of people at Gap. He was a little hesitant, I think, comment on some changes they need to be made there to save themselves. So I'll do it for him. Here are my suggestions because I have no friends at Gap.First up, I think they need to close 50% of their US Gap stores. There's, I believe, over 500 Gap stores in North America. You got to slice that in half, get those costs right. This brand, at this point its life cycle, should only be in the top malls in the country and the top offsite or locations that you could find in local neighborhoods or outside of the mall.Story continuesNext up, exit most international locations. We've seen Abercrombie close a lot of flagship stores overseas. We saw Target, a couple of many years ago, exit Canada. Gap has no idea what it's doing overseas. Close those stores, get your costs right, reinvest in the US business, like we've seen the likes of Lowe's, which recently sold off its Canadian business.Just focus on the US for Gap. Sell Athleta. That is a thing, or that is a view that has long been held on the Street. This is a brand that probably Gap has mismanaged in five-- over the past five years. Sell that brand. Again, focus on that Gap and Old Navy division.Next here, hire Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's CEO Fran Horowitz. I think she has done an awesome job resetting the culture at Abercrombie, resetting what the clothes look like at Hollister and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. I think she should get a call from Gap, which is a bigger brand at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. And if anybody is going to turn that company around, I think it's her.And last but not least, fix the damn sizes. You go-- I went to Banana Republic over the weekend. I left with the medium. And it still fits like a large. That is just not how these clothes are supposed to fit. And the same deal, the same vibe is over at Gap. Even Old Navy, the sizing has always been awful for men's and women's. I encourage them to finally get these things right so they fit true to size.My take is this. I used to like me a good Gap little sweater. Right, there I am right now, in a turtleneck, which I don't wear turtlenecks anymore, but my former Gaps off in college, I always used to wear turtlenecks. That was my thing, and I probably had that sweater.JULIE HYMAN: What changed?BRIAN SOZZI: They're just too warm. Just too warm. Yeah.BRAD SMITH: Could you bring back the turtleneck for tomorrow?BRIAN SOZZI: I can't do it, but I heard you guys are going to do it.JULIE HYMAN: We are. We'll be the turtleneck twins tomorrow. You'll be the odd man out.BRIAN SOZZI: It's too warm. I just emit too much just, like, energy. I can't sweat. I don't want to get hot, guys. It's gonna be hot.BRAD SMITH: The sizing is off because they know that you're going to the gym for five hours every Saturday.BRIAN SOZZI: The sizing is awful. Just do better. Give me clothes that fit.JULIE HYMAN: Well, their sizing has always been like that.BRIAN SOZZI: Why can't they fix it? Nobody else has this problem. Just make better stuff, man.]"

To build on this momentum and to address the well-documented challenges associated with plastic, we want to share our strategy to further reduce our use of virgin plastic in our products and packaging.Reducing plastic in our productsWe have set a goal that by our fiscal year 2025, 50% of the plastic used in our products (by weight) will be made of recycled content.** Most plastic used in Cisco products is found in a few product categories: Cisco IP phones, Webex collaboration devices, access points, and Cisco Meraki products.As part of our journey to minimize the use of virgin plastic, our teams are sourcing more recycled plastic parts and designing plastic out of our products. For example, select models of our 8800 Series IP phones consist of 68% recycled plastic and some products in our Catalyst series of network switches were designed without bezels, the plastic cosmetic surface on the outside of a device.Reducing plastic in our packagingWe are rethinking product packaging and are sourcing alternative materials to plastic. Our strategy includes eliminating plastic bags in our packaging wherever possible. In our fiscal year 2022, the majority of accessories for Cisco Meraki products shipped in paper-based packaging, which was made of 70% recycled content. And in certain other product lines, power cords are labeled with scannable wraps instead of plastic bags. As a result of these changes, we avoided shipping an estimated ten million plastic bags, representing 28 tonnes of plastic.Furthermore, we are continuing to reduce foam packaging, another material made from plastic. The packaging for the Catalyst IR8140 Heavy Duty Router is the first solution at Cisco to use a fiber-flute material in place of the foam cushioning that is typically required for heavier products. Opportunities to minimize the use of foam across our product portfolio will help us reach our goal of reducing our use of foam packaging by 75% by our fiscal year 2025.***Story continuesEmbracing circular designAddressing plastic is just one part of our holistic circular design strategy, which is focused on designing products and packaging with reuse and resource efficiency in mind. We have set a goal of incorporating Circular Design Principles into the design of all new products and packaging by fiscal 2025. To do this, we are embedding circular design requirements into our design tools and product development processes, including engaging our suppliers on innovative, sustainable designs for our products, components, and packaging.We are also working to avoid shipping unwanted accessories to customers by integrating accessory selection into the ordering process. In our fiscal year 2022, over 8,500 customer orders opted out of receiving a power cord, avoiding the shipment of approximately 205,000 unnecessary power cords, as well as minimizing the packaging that would have wrapped them.We are committed to designing products and systems that help to enable reuse, minimize environmental impact, and realize value for our stakeholders. We look forward to continuing to share our progress towards these goals along the way.Footnotes* Compared to a fiscal 2018 base year.** The plastics included in this goal exclude those contained in commodity components sourced from suppliers (e.g., plastic screws, fans, and cables).*** Compared to a fiscal 2019 base year; goal is measured by weight.Forward Looking Statements: Readers are cautioned that this blog post may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are difficult to predict, including those factors identified in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
