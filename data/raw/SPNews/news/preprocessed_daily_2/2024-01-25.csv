The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Texas Instruments' shares before the 30th of January to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.20 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Texas Instruments has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of US$170.07. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Texas Instruments is paying out an acceptable 70% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out an unsustainably high 338% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Unless there were something in the business we're not grasping, this could signal a risk that the dividend may have to be cut in the future."", ""While Texas Instruments's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Texas Instruments to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Texas Instruments earnings per share are up 4.6% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing somewhat, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Texas Instruments has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is Texas Instruments an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Texas Instruments is paying out a reasonable percentage of its income and an uncomfortably high 338% of its cash flow as dividends. At least earnings per share have been growing steadily. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now."", ""Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Texas Instruments. We've identified 2 warning signs with Texas Instruments (at least 1 which can't be ignored), and understanding these should be part of your investment process."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the importance of payout ratios, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios.\xa0', ""Investors have traditionally shown a strong preference for dividend stocks because of their ability to generate income. When seeking stocks that provide a steady income stream, investors often lean toward companies that have a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time. Such companies typically maintain low payout ratios, indicating robust cash generation capabilities. Payout ratio is a measure indicating the percentage of a company's net income or free cash flow that is distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it implies that the company has the potential to sustain or even increase its dividend payments in the future. Adam Kramer, who oversees the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund, discussed payout ratios in a report. Here is what he said:"", '""It\'s important to analyze the stability of a company’s cash flows when assessing the level of payout. When the payout ratio is more than 50%, you always stress test that ratio.""', 'A high payout ratio indicates that a company is allocating a substantial portion of its earnings towards dividend payments, resulting in a reduced amount of funds available for potential investments in the future growth of the business. In a study conducted by Wellington Management, dividend-paying stocks were categorized into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, known as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, included the lowest dividend payers. The second quintile stocks showed better performance than the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods from 1930 to 2022, while the first and third quintile stocks tied for the second place, outperforming the Index 67% of the time.', ""The study revealed that the success of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks could be attributed to the sustainability issues associated with the excessive dividend payouts of the first quintile. Additionally, the average dividend-payout ratio since 1979 for the first two quintiles of dividend payers within the Russell 1000 Index was highlighted in the study. The first-quintile stocks had an average dividend payout ratio of 74%, while the second quintile had a more moderate 40% average payout ratio. Maintaining a high payout ratio, such as 74%, may pose challenges for a company if it undergoes a decline in earnings. In such circumstances, the company might be compelled to reduce its dividend, a move often interpreted in financial markets as a sign of weakness. This reduction frequently leads to a decline in the company's stock price."", 'Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth.

We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate.

UAA have collaborated to develop NEOLAST, a revolutionary fiber set to redefine the landscape of performance stretch fabrics. This innovative material not only promises enhanced stretch performance but also addresses crucial sustainability challenges in the apparel industry, marking a significant step toward circular manufacturing.NEOLAST fibers are poised to be a game-changer, offering the sought-after qualities of elite performance fabrics, including powerful stretch, durability, comfort and improved moisture-wicking. What sets NEOLAST apart is its commitment to sustainability, challenging the conventional use of elastane, commonly known as spandex, in the production of stretch fabrics.The proprietary solvent-free, melt-extrusion process used in manufacturing NEOLAST fibers eliminates hazardous chemicals typically associated with elastane production. This not only enhances safety but also positions NEOLAST as a more environmentally friendly alternative. Furthermore, the fibers will be produced using recyclable elastoester polymers, addressing the challenge of recycling blended fabrics containing elastane.The collaboration between Celanese and Under Armour goes beyond product development. Together, they are exploring ways to improve the compatibility of stretch fabrics with future recycling systems and infrastructure. This forward-thinking approach aligns with the growing trend toward a circular economy, where end users can recycle performance stretch fabrics, closing the loop on a longstanding challenge in the industry.Celanese expressed optimism about the partnership, stating that it is proud to bring its polymer expertise and technical knowledge to help produce NEOLAST for textiles and fabrics. Under Armour echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the transformative nature of NEOLAST.Beyond sustainability benefits, NEOLAST offers increased production precision, allowing spinners to fine-tune power-stretch levels and engineer fibers to meet diverse fabric specifications. As Celanese explores applications with Under Armour, it also intends to make NEOLAST available to the broader apparel industry, potentially reducing dependence on traditional elastane.As the world strives for eco-friendly alternatives, NEOLAST stands at the forefront, revolutionizing not just stretch performance but also paving the way for a greener, circular approach to athletic apparel manufacturing.

After all, doing the right thing in many cases involves self-sacrifice. That’s not the most helpful idea when you’re dealing with the sharks on Wall Street. Still, sustainable stocks benefit from one critical age cohort: Generation Z.', 'According to a NielsenIQ study, 78% of U.S. consumers overall state that a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Nevertheless, a GfK Consumer Life report shows that over half (53%) of these consumers think more sustainable products cost too much. On the surface, the latter statistic seems to bode poorly for eco-friendly stocks.', 'However, Gen Z is throwing everything for a loop. Per a Forbes article, the vast majority of this cohort prefers to buy sustainable brands. Also, one study found that 90% of Gen Z members made changes in their lives to align with sustainability practices. These folks not only talk the talk, they walk the walk.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Basically, if you’re not eco-friendly, you’re risking losing business with the emerging generation. On that note, below are compelling sustainable stocks to consider.', 'Source: Jordi_Cor / Shutterstock.com', 'By the looks of its corporate identity, Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN) might not seem like the most eco-friendly stocks available. However, the company plays a significant role in the broader green directive. Yes, it’s involved in waste management, which is a dirty business (that someone has to do). But related to the underlying topic, Waste Connections also promoted nationwide recycling initiatives. As well, it offers renewable natural gas (RNG) facilities.', 'Another aspect that makes WCN one of the intriguing sustainable stocks to consider is its financials. Contrary to the stereotype of sustainable organizations, Waste Connections prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.1%, above 62% of its peers. In addition, it’s consistently profitable, affording much confidence for investors. Plus, it rarely misses regarding its per-share profitability targets.', 'In fairness, WCN does trade at a rich multiple of 45.6X. However, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) – which tells us how efficiently it converts capital to profitable investments – comes in at 6.56%, above almost 64% of rivals.', 'Source: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.com', 'Without any context, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) seems a very odd proposition for eco-friendly stocks. Everybody knows that Levi Strauss is one of the top fashion brands in the world. But a sustainability powerhouse? That might seem like a stretch until you consider how the company is embracing the broader green directive. In particular, it’s committed to the circular economy.', 'According to the European Parliament, the circular economy represents a model of production and consumption. This involves “sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible.” Regarding Levi Strauss’ role, the company collaborates with partners to explore garment recycling and reuse initiatives.', 'Notably, InsightAce Analytic reports that the circular economy could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.59% between 2023 and 2031.', 'Contrary to some misconceptions, going sustainable can be profitable too. In fact, Levi Strauss enjoys solid margins across the board. Thus, it’s one of the top eco-friendly stocks to consider.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational technology corporation, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction. If you use a PC or do any kind of work on a computer, chances are, you interface with a Microsoft protocol or platform. However, MSFT should also deserve attention and respect as one of the top sustainable stocks. Indeed, the company forwards several sustainability initiatives that serve as inspiration for us all.', 'Per its website, Microsoft aims to be carbon-negative by 2030, not just neutral. Also, by the same year, the company will be water-positive. That means it will replenish more water than it uses. As well, by the start of the next decade, it will implement a zero-waste footprint. Finally, by 2050, the technology stalwart will remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975.', 'And if you think that eco-friendly stocks don’t pay, just look at its 52-week return. Yeah, Microsoft tends to be boring but nothing was boring about its 2023 performance. Enticingly, analysts still anticipate more share growth, rating MSFT a strong buy with a $429.25 price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational industrial conglomerate, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) primarily operates in four areas of business: aerospace, building automation, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. Because of its vast footprint and relevancies, it’s practically inevitable that Honeywell brings go-green solutions to the table. It’s not a pure-play example of traditional eco-friendly stocks but it gets the job done.', 'Perhaps the most tangible benefit that Honeywell offers for our planet is its technologies in the renewables and energy storage solution markets. Through its myriad services – ranging from commercial/industrial operations, independent power production facilities, and the cost-effective operations of utilities – Honeywell is an indispensable component of the wind and solar ecosystem. As well, it forwards advanced acumen in the battery energy storage system industry.', 'Now, the one conspicuous drawback for HON is its choppiness.

Also, its ROIC stands at 13.55%, above nearly 90% of its rivals.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'As a water technology firm, Xylem (NYSE:XYL) makes an intuitive case for sustainable stocks. While about 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, very little of it is drinkable. In fact, National Geographic points out that only about 3% of the Earth’s water is fresh water. And within this tiny group, only about 1.2% can be used as drinking water.', 'The message couldn’t come in clearer: we need to be good stewards of the world’s most precious resource. Fortunately, Xylem’s multivariate business – which encompasses infrastructure (i.e. clean water delivery, wastewater management) and applied services (i.e. residential and commercial building solutions) – can help move the needle.', 'Enticingly, Xylem offers digital solutions to help bring about sustainability. For example, through the use of advanced sensors and new technical infrastructures, Xylem can facilitate high levels of resource efficiencies.', 'While XYL isn’t the cheapest idea out there with a trailing-year multiple of 45.48X, it consistently prints net income on an annual basis.

In 2022, the company had planned between $50 billion to $55 billion in new infrastructure investments. While it’s supremely relevant in the go-green paradigm, NEE encountered significant volatility last year.', 'As you might suspect, the main culprit centered on rising interest rates. With borrowing costs suddenly elevated due to the Federal Reserve’s war against inflation, the headwind made it difficult for businesses to leverage debt and equity funding. As well, other entities within NextEra’s wide value chain also struggled amid economic challenges. Subsequently, investors seemingly couldn’t exit out of NEE fast enough.', 'Still, for speculators, the current valuation presents a relatively discounted opportunity. Trading at nearly 16X trailing-year earnings, NEE isn’t really objectively cheap. However, it’s far lower than the triple-digit multiple seen during the first quarter of 2022.

However, a perhaps lesser-known angle of its business is the company’s focus on sustainability. Indeed, Unilever spearheads multiple initiatives that cover the whole spectrum of environmental, social and governance (ESG) directives.', 'One area that should be highlighted is Unilever’s mission to completely rethink plastic. According to industry resource Supply Chain Solutions Center, “[p]lastic packaging is extremely wasteful and impacts earth’s ecosystems, on which we depend. Due to poor product design and lack of political infrastructure, the majority of plastic waste is sent to landfills or disposed of into the environment.”', 'Among the 9.2 billion tons of plastic that have been produced, only about 9% has been recycled properly. Unilever would like to shift this narrative in a positive direction, committing to halving the amount of virgin plastic it uses in its packaging by 2025.

But some trade-offs are just too extreme to bother with.', ""Many ultra-high-yield dividend stocks fall into this category. Contrary to the safe-and-steady image you may have of passive income investments, an unusually high yield can be a warning sign. That's the story behind Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) and its gargantuan 13.5% dividend yield. Most dividend investors should avoid it, and for very good reasons. But for Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE: BNS) and Realty Income (NYSE: O), the story couldn't be more different. Here's what you need to know about these three ultra-high-yield stocks."", ""Before explaining why Annaly isn't a great dividend stock, it should be noted that it isn't really designed to be owned by dividend investors. The company is meant to be plugged into an asset allocation model, providing large investors like insurance companies with direct exposure to mortgage securities. It's just that, for tax reasons, Annaly is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), so it pays out most of its earnings as dividends."", ""Large investors simply reinvest the cash they collect and look at total return. But the huge 13.5% dividend yield isn't really a number small investors can count on, especially if they are trying to live off the income they generate from their portfolios. Why is this so? Because over the past decade, the dividend has been cut multiple times. Mortgage REITs are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, investor sentiment around mortgage securities, and the housing market, among other things, so financial performance can be volatile."", ""Annaly's stock has basically followed the dividend lower, leading to a situation in which a small investor would have been left with a smaller income stream and less capital. That's about as bad as it can get for a dividend investor."", ""Unless you are willing to bet that the future will be drastically different from the past, you are better off avoiding Annaly. But all high-yield stocks aren't the same."", 'While Annaly owns mortgage securities, Realty Income actually owns a portfolio of physical commercial properties. They are leased out to tenants, just like you might do if you owned a rental property. Realty Income\'s dividend has been increased annually for 29 consecutive years, and it\'s paid out monthly instead of quarterly -- in fact, the REIT has trademarked the nickname ""The Monthly Dividend Company.""', 'In fairness, the dividend tends to grow pretty slowly, at around 4.3% a year over the past 29 years, but Realty Income has proven to be a highly reliable dividend payer. Now add in a hefty 5.5% dividend yield, which is toward the high side of the historical range over the past decade. That suggests that the stock is cheap today. The dividend seems safe for other reasons, too, given the fact that Realty Income is the largest player in the net lease space (giving at an advantage when it comes to accessing capital and inking big deals) and it has an investment grade rated balance sheet.', 'If you are looking at Annaly because it is a REIT, look at reliable dividend payer Realty Income instead.', ""Another option, if you are simply looking for a financial stock to buy, is Scotiabank, as the Bank of Nova Scotia is known. It is one of Canada's largest banks in a local industry that is highly regulated. In fact, there's so much regulation that the top banks pretty much have protected market positions. The heightened regulation has also instilled a conservative ethos into Canadian banks like Scotiabank. This isn't a bank that's likely to take on huge risks -- unlike some major U.S. banks, Scotiabank didn't cut its dividend during the Great Recession."", ""But what's behind Scotiabank's huge 6.8% dividend yield? Two things. First, while most of its Canadian peers have looked to the U.S. market to grow, Scotiabank has focused more on Central and South America. Those are inherently riskier regions in which to operate. And, second, Scotiabank has lagged its peers on key financial metrics, like earnings growth, return on equity, and non-interest revenue growth. So there are reasons why Scotiabank is one of the highest-yielding bank stocks you can buy. However, management is working on improving its relative performance, via things like improving its cost structure and bringing in more core deposits, which are a relatively inexpensive funding source."", ""But more to the point here, when confronted by analysts about the high yield, management was pretty matter-of-fact about the situation. To summarize, the payout ratio is high right now, but management doesn't think there's any reason to worry. And, in time, management expects the steps it is taking to improve its relative performance to also reduce the payout ratio back into a more comfortable range. If you can handle collecting a big yield while a company with a hundred-year history of reliably paying dividends works through a rough patch, then Scotiabank might be for you."", 'Far too often, an unusually high yield is a sign of risk that gets ignored by yield-hungry investors. So make sure you dig into the story behind the dividend stocks you buy, a move which would likely lead you to steer clear of Annaly Capital. But a high yield can also be an opportunity, as it appears to be with Realty Income and Bank of Nova Scotia (aka Scotiabank). When you examine the stories behind these two reliable dividend stocks, they start to look more attractive, not less.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Annaly Capital Management right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Annaly Capital Management, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Annaly Capital Management wasn't one of them.

Here are two that I'm planning to buy shares of this year, and that could have market-beating potential for years to come."", 'Realty Income (NYSE: O) has rebounded significantly from its October 2023 lows but is still trading at a big discount to its historical valuation levels. But this real estate investment trust (REIT) and its 5.5%-yielding monthly dividend could be a great opportunity for patient long-term investors.', ""If you aren't familiar with the business, Realty Income owns a portfolio of more than 13,250 properties, most of which are occupied by single tenants in retail or service businesses. It focuses on tenants that have recession-resistant qualities and don't have to worry much about competition from e-commerce. Tenants sign long-term leases with annual rent increases built in, so all Realty Income needs to do is acquire real estate with excellent tenants in place and enjoy years of predictable, growing income."", 'Additionally, Realty Income has A-rated credit, which gives it access to relatively cheap capital, even in a high-interest-rate environment. For example, Realty Income just issued new debt to help fund its Spirit Realty Capital acquisition, at a weighted average interest rate of less than 5%.', 'The long-term numbers show just how powerful its compound growth model can be. Even with its underperformance in the rising-interest-rate environment over the past two years, Realty Income has delivered a 13.4% annualized total return since it went public in 1994, handily outperforming the S&P 500. It has increased its dividend payouts on 123 occasions since then, with no cuts, and has done a great job of creating value for investors in a variety of market environments. Plus, since REITs are highly rate-sensitive stocks in general, Realty Income could get a nice tailwind if interest rates start to ease in 2024.', 'You may have seen the phrase ""Magnificent Seven"" in the headlines recently -- it refers to the seven largest tech stocks in the S&P 500, a group that has accounted for a disproportionate share of the market\'s strong performance in the past year.', ""While this is certainly true, it isn't just the megacaps that were outperforming. The S&P 500 as a whole has outperformed the small-cap Russell 2000 index by 38 percentage points over the last three years. But this could be a pivotal year, and the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO) could be a great way to play it. In fact, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee has called small caps his top investment idea of 2024, and predicts that the Russell 2000 could potentially rise by 50% or more this year alone."", ""There are a few potential catalysts that could cause that to happen. Falling interest rates (and the Fed is widely expected to cut them somewhat this year) would lead to lower borrowing costs, potentially increasing investors' appetite for risk. A stronger economy could also help narrow the valuation gap, as small caps tend to be more sensitive to things like recession fears."", ""The last time the Russell 2000's price-to-book valuation was this discounted compared to the S&P 500 was 25 years ago, and that period was followed by more than a decade of small-cap outperformance."", ""To be perfectly clear, while I think both of these investments have a great chance of outperforming the S&P 500 in 2024, I also think they make excellent long-term holdings, regardless of what happens this year. Realty Income was actually the first REIT I ever bought, and I've continued to build my position in it for more than a decade.

And usage among those retail chains increased that year compared to 2019. Even if PayPal's market share declines, this will still be a top online payments company for years to come."", ""Investors may also be underwhelmed by PayPal's recent results; through the first nine months of 2023, its revenue totaled $21.7 billion and rose by only 8%. But with the global economy still worried about a possible recession, there's a bit of hesitance among consumers. In a bull market, there could be much more optimism and consumer spending, leading to better results for PayPal. "", ""The company's growth days are by no means over.

Still, the real estate investment trust (REIT) has been doing fairly well of late, and there are no serious concerns about its performance or the safety of its dividend, which yields around 5.5%."", 'Through the first nine months of 2023, the REIT reported funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.09, which was better than the $2.99 it posted a year ago. The REIT has a diversified portfolio anchored by some of the biggest names in retail and is one of the safer REITs you can invest in today.', 'With a strong FFO, a key number that REIT investors focus on when evaluating the safety of the dividend, there are no glaring concerns for investors about the business itself. The REIT pays a monthly dividend of $0.2565, which would total approximately $2.31 over a nine-month stretch -- far lower than the $3.09 FFO per share it posted over a similar period; its payout ratio is 75% based on that metric.', 'Concerns about high interest rates are likely a key reason investors remain hesitant to invest in Realty Income and other REITs.

It's one of the safer cannabis companies to invest in, given its relatively strong financials, but there will be some inherent volatility with this investment due to the uncertainty around marijuana reform."", 'There is excitement around a possible rescheduling of cannabis, down from a Schedule I substance to a Schedule III.

B is poised to gain from its well-diversified portfolio. The strong performance of Aerospace segment, driven by volume increases within both the original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and Aftermarket businesses, is aiding the company.

In August 2023, the company completed the buyout of MB Aerospace, expanding its aerospace business’ global OEM offerings and aftermarket repair capabilities. This also enhanced Barnes’ ability to deliver value-add solutions across the aero-engine value chain, broadened customer relationships and widened exposure to the defense industry. MB Aerospace is part of Barnes’ Aerospace segment.B continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first nine months of 2023, Barnes rewarded its shareholders with dividends of $24.3 million. In 2022, the company paid out dividends worth $32.4 million to its shareholders.However, B is facing productivity challenges in some of its facilities across North America and Asia due to a significant increase in new employees.The company’s motion control solutions business within the Industrial segment is facing challenges due to the ongoing United Auto Workers strike. Also, shipment delays and lagging orders are worrisome for the segment. Higher-than-expected transformation costs, a slowdown in the U.S. economy, geopolitical instability and labor productivity challenges may impact Barnes’ performance in the near term.Escalating costs and expenses have been a concern for the company over time.

The Series A investment will assist DXwand in expanding further in the MENA region and accelerate its research and development efforts in generative AI, knowledge mining, and omnichannel conversational AI within the region.', 'Before founding DXwand, CEO Ahmed Mahmoud was employed at Microsoft, where he led their data and artificial intelligence enterprise sales in the Gulf region and the Middle East. His professional journey began with an engineering background and working on software and AI technology within development teams. Transitioning to the industry’s business side, Mahmoud worked at Vodafone and then Microsoft; in these roles, he engaged with clients to explore ways AI could enhance productivity and overall user experience.', 'At Microsoft, he identified something obvious: Conversational AI and broader AI technologies were not fully matured and developed in the Middle East, as solutions from Silicon Valley didn’t cater to Arabic or other languages in the region. “At that time, I tried to validate if we could build AI models for spoken dialects in the region, but we encountered some challenges. The realization of a business opportunity prompted me to resign from Microsoft and establish DXwand to address this gap.”', 'After going through an accelerator in 2018, Mahmoud launched DXwand to provide small businesses with a customer-centric chatbot tailored for sales over social media platforms. The firm initially secured seed funding of $150,000 from angels in Qatar and Egypt. However, the team soon realized it needed to switch business models to find product-market fit and become profitable.', '“Our primary focus was building an AI solution that works for Arabic dialects, which are very complex and sophisticated -- even Egypt had more than seven or eight spoken dialects. And that helped us to work well in this region, for the areas we support,” the Microsoft alum said in the interview. “Yet, this value by itself gets more sophistication wherever we go to more clients because those businesses require not just to have something to understand the language, but they also wanted something easier to onboard, and at that time, the natural language understanding solutions required a lot of efforts in labeling the data and working on labeling such data is a huge set of time and efforts that required businesses for us to do.”', 'Generative AI isn’t a home run in the enterprise', 'In 2021, the Egypt-born AI startup embarked on a pivot, targeting corporates and enterprises instead of small businesses as it directed its efforts toward knowledge mining and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) domains. Back then, the buzz around large language models hadn’t yet taken off as they have now — and DXwand aimed to create a knowledge graph that eliminated the need for customers to label data manually. This approach allows it to pre-label data, facilitating faster onboarding of more clients and supporting sophisticated use cases, ultimately aiding enterprises in adoption.', 'Consider a scenario where an enterprise deals with a vast repository of policies and data, enough to fill a room with PDFs. The challenge arises when they aim to automate customer service or sales over their digital channels — a task that typically involves manually labeling all that data. Realistically, achieving this is no easy feat; many might find it impractical. This is where knowledge mining comes into play. With this capability, such enterprises can input their raw data -- and DXwand’s system takes care of the labeling by creating a pre-labeled set and streamlining their processes to implement conversational experiences for their customers or staff without the painstaking task of manual data labeling.', 'In a nutshell, DXwand’s AI-powered software automates text and voice conversations between businesses, their customers, employees, and citizen-facing government services. This functionality spans various platforms, including call centers, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS, and websites. The platform claims to comprehend slang in both Arabic and English, extracting valuable insights from conversations and presenting them on dashboards for businesses to make informed decisions. According to the startup, it provides analytical tools and dashboards that offer insights into these conversations and transform them into leads and sales, enhancing customer retention and acquisition.', 'To scale this model in the Middle East and Gulf regions, the startup took in additional investments between 2021 and 2022: $1.3 million in seed extension from SOSV and other investors and $1 million pre-Series A from the Dubai Future District Fund. This period coincided with the surge in interest and maturity of large language models. As these technologies became more robust, DXwand AI seized the opportunity to expand its offerings and cater to the rising demand for such solutions among its clients.', '“We used those funds to support and accelerate our investments in knowledge mining, getting and leveraging specific solutions for specifically Arabic and other dialects. But also building on top of that knowledge mining to make it work for any language and expand the company into other areas like in Africa and Europe,” Mahmoud, who runs the startup alongside co-founder Mahmoud Gomaa, remarked. “Today, we have some clients from Africa. So we started to leverage that because it’s language agnostic, helps clients to onboard easily and solve their problems.”', 'Building a viable pricing model for generative AI features could be challenging', 'The chief executive highlighted that the chatbot platform caters to over 40 clients across the MENA region, spanning diverse sectors such as healthcare, e-commerce, fintech, telecom, government, and legal. Since its inception, the AI startup has facilitated over 5 million conversations and currently stands as a profitable entity, Mahmoud added. Depending on usage volumes, clients are charged yearly subscriptions between $50,000 and $400,000. Furthermore, Mahmoud revealed that the company recorded over $5 million in annual recurring revenues in 2023, representing a 2x year-over-year growth and underscoring the platform’s increasing significance and adoption in a market where AI platforms are few and far between.', 'Armed with this new investment, DXwand’s subsequent plans include expanding across Africa and Saudi Arabia, Mahmoud shared on the call, adding that both regions hold particular importance in the startup’s strategy. He also notes that accelerating research efforts, specifically in knowledge mining and retrieval augmented generation, and forming alliances with technology providers like telecom operators to establish meaningful partnerships within the communities it serves remain top of mind for the startup, too.', 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/dxwand-raises-4m-to-scale-its-conversational-ai-platform-for-enterprises-in-mena/']"

The painful result was her sexual assault,” said attorney Alec Wright, who represents the girl and her mother in the lawsuit.', 'The lawsuit alleges that the then 15-year-old girl, whose name was withheld in the lawsuit, was led off campus by three male students in October 2022. The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks employees witnessed the male students taking turns entering the bathroom with the girl and did not intervene. The alleged assailants then took her to an empty building managed by Kappa, where the third boy sexually assaulted the girl, according to the lawsuit filed in Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.', 'At first, the girl was unable to communicate to her mother what happened to her. But days later the mother said she was notified by the school that the girl was found crying at a lunchroom table alone because of a rumor that three boys had sex with her. The mother said she met with school officials who were then notified that the incident occurred at Starbucks, and not at the school as officials initially suspected.', 'The mother took the girl for a medical exam that she said showed positive signs of sexual assault. She reported the assault to police, but more than a year later police have not filed charges.', ""A spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety said the case had been closed and that the county district attorney's office had determined it would not pursue charges."", '“When we learned of these allegations, we acted with extreme urgency to support law enforcement throughout their investigation,” a spokesperson for Starbucks wrote in an emailed statement. ""Our goal is always to keep our stores safe for our partners and our customers. Due to the sensitive nature of this matter, and out of respect for all involved, we cannot comment further right now.”', 'A phone number was not available for Kappa, but The Associated Press left a message with a real estate company that handles rentals at several Kappa properties. A spokesperson for Pittsburgh Public Schools said the district does not comment on pending litigation.', ""Pittsburgh Public Schools provides public transportation bus passes to high schoolers who live within 2 miles (3 kilometers) of their school and to younger students who live within 1.5 mile (2.4 kilometers) of their school. At Taylor Allderdice High School, district officials had negotiated with Pittsburgh's public transportation authority to move the public transit bus stop that many students use to the location in front of the Starbucks."", ""The girl's mother notified school officials that her daughter would need help adjusting to high school and with taking public transportation to school, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit notes the girl's IQ during evaluation was determined to be around 65, and then below 60 on a second test, placing her in the lowest 1% of students intellectually."", 'However, the lawsuit alleges that during her first months at the high school, the girl was left unsupervised and allowed to either wander the halls or hide in the bathroom during her classes. The tardy and attendance policy was not enforced because of her disabilities, and staff failed to address her leaving class or provide any safety monitors for her during school hours or enroute to and from the bus stop, according to the lawsuit.', '“It just makes me feel angry to know that there was such little oversight or protection for my daughter. If she leaves in the morning to go to school, then she should return home from school safe,” the girl’s mother said. ""Taylor Allderdice let her be lured off campus, and Starbucks let her be attacked in its bathrooms. It’s all just so frustrating and disheartening. It’s just very hard to describe.”', ""The Associated Press does not name victims of sexual assault or abuse unless they come forward publicly. The names of both the girl and her mother were withheld from the lawsuit to protect the girl's identity."", 'The lawsuit alleges the male teens were given unrestricted access to the girl when they were able to lead her off campus to the Starbucks bus stop, where school officials did not provide any safety monitors during prime transportation hours despite knowing about increased incidents of student-based violence and other negative activities.', 'The month before the sexual assault occurred, a large group of students got into a fight at the bus stop. A police officer was injured while trying to break up the fight and police shocked two students with Tasers during the incident.', 'Owners of businesses in the same building as the Starbucks have reported harassment of customers, a storefront window being broken, students challenging business owners to fights and other issues with drugs and vandalism. At least one business owner has asked the school district to move the bus stop during school board meetings.', 'The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks and Kappa failed to respond to the widely known issues with crime, violence and mischief by not creating policies or conducting trainings for employees on how to keep themselves or patrons safe, and by not providing security measures like guards during high traffic times.', ""The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks employees allowed students largely unrestricted access to its bathrooms partly because the students increased the store's sales.""]"

According to the Sheriff’s Report, the second ignition started approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo’s power lines in the area.', 'The Sheriff’s Report states that the most probable cause of the second ignition was hot particles discharged from PSCo’s power lines after one of the power lines detached from its insulator in strong winds, and further states that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an underground coal fire. According to the Sheriff’s Report, no design, installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies were identified on PSCo’s electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition.

Colorado law does not impose joint and several liability in tort actions. Instead, under Colorado law, a defendant is liable for the degree or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the defendant conspired with another defendant. A jury’s verdict in a Colorado civil case must be unanimous.', 'Colorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages awarded to the injured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three times the amount of actual damages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the pendency of the case or the defendant has acted in a willful and wanton manner during the action which further aggravated plaintiff’s damages.', 'In the event Xcel Energy Inc. or PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The volume of gallons covered by derivative contracts that ultimately get exercised in any given period may vary significantly from the volumes used to calculate the Company\'s maximum fuel hedged percentages, as market prices and the Company\'s fuel consumption fluctuate.8Net cash position is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, less the sum of short-term and long-term debt.9See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for an explanation of the Company\'s leverage calculation.', 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

These GAAP financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges and benefits the Company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future performance difficult.', 'As a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information (also referred to as ""excluding special items""), including results that it refers to as ""economic,"" which the Company\'s management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that relate to the Company\'s performance on an economic fuel cost basis include Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income (loss), non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Income (loss) before income taxes, non-GAAP; Provision (benefit) for income taxes, net, non-GAAP; Net income (loss), non-GAAP; Net income (loss) per share, diluted, non-GAAP; and Operating expenses per ASM, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents). The Company\'s economic Fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company\'s actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of Fuel and oil expense, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the Company\'s fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company\'s management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the Company\'s operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.', ""Further information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\xa031, 2022 and subsequent filings."", 'The Company\'s GAAP results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed ""special items"" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. Financial measures identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. For the periods presented, in addition to the items discussed above, special items include:', ""Accruals associated with ongoing labor contract negotiations with\xa0TWU 556, which represents the Company's Flight Attendants. These amounts accrued in 2023 relate to additional compensation for services performed by Employees outside of this fiscal year;"", ""Accruals associated with labor contract negotiations with SWAPA, which represents the Company's Pilots. These amounts accrued during the fourth quarter 2023 and/or for the fiscal year 2023, relate to additional compensation for services performed by Employees outside of those applicable fiscal periods;"", 'Noncash impairment charges, primarily associated with adjustments to the salvage values for previously retired airframes;', ""A charge associated with a settlement reached with the Department of Transportation as a result of the Company's December 2022 operational disruption;"", 'A charge associated with a tentative litigation settlement regarding certain California state meal-and-rest-break regulations for flight attendants;', 'Unrealized mark-to-market adjustment associated with certain available for sale securities; and', ""Losses associated with the partial extinguishment of the Company's Convertible Notes and early prepayment of debt. Such losses are incurred as a result of opportunistic decisions made by the Company to prepay portions of its debt, most of which was incurred during the pandemic in order to provide liquidity during the prolonged downturn in air travel."", ""Because management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the Company's ongoing performance as an airline, the Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of special items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income (loss), non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Income (loss) before income taxes, non-GAAP; Provision (benefit) for income taxes, net, non-GAAP; Net income (loss), non-GAAP; Net income (loss) per share, diluted, non-GAAP; and Operating expenses per ASM, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents)."", 'The Company has also provided its calculation of return on invested capital, which is a measure of financial performance used by management to evaluate its investment returns on capital. Return on invested capital is not a substitute for financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP and should not be utilized in place of such GAAP results. Although return on invested capital is not a measure defined by GAAP, it is calculated by the Company, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures. Those non-GAAP financial measures are utilized for the same reasons as those noted above for Net income (loss), non-GAAP and Operating income (loss), non-GAAP. The comparable GAAP measures include charges or benefits that are deemed ""special items"" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends, and the Company\'s profitability targets and estimates, both internally and externally, are based on non-GAAP results since ""special items"" cannot be reliably predicted or estimated. The Company believes non-GAAP return on invested capital is a meaningful measure because it quantifies the Company\'s effectiveness in generating returns relative to the capital it has invested in its business. Although return on invested capital is commonly used as a measure of capital efficiency, definitions of return on invested capital differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for non-GAAP return on invested capital in the accompanying reconciliation in order to allow investors to compare and contrast its calculation to the calculations provided by other companies.', ""The Company has also provided adjusted debt, invested capital, and adjusted debt to invested capital (leverage), which are non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Management believes these supplemental measures can provide a more accurate view of the Company's leverage and risk, since they consider the Company's debt and debt-like obligation profile and capital. Leverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts, and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies. Although adjusted debt, invested capital, and leverage ratios are commonly-used financial measures, definitions of each differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculations for non-GAAP adjusted debt and adjusted equity in the accompanying reconciliation below in order to allow investors to compare and contrast its calculations to the calculations provided by other companies.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.69%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Roper Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Roper Technologies would post earnings of $4.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.32, delivering a surprise of +2.61%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

Basically, lightning might not strike twice. However, the most recent jobs report for December may have reset expectations.', 'First, the print landed at 216,000 new jobs added last month. In contrast, economists expected only 170,000 positions gained. As well, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%. However, experts before the disclosure saw a rise to 3.8%. What does this all translate to? An unexpectedly higher volume of more dollars chasing after fewer goods.', 'That’s inflationary and that may help drive down the relative value of the dollar. And such a dynamic has a clear impact on retail stocks to buy. Last year, circumstances were difficult for many businesses in part because the personal saving rate increased. And it made sense that it did because a greenback that’s worth more incentivizes savings.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'However, a greenback that’s worth less over time? That’s inflationary and that incentives spending. In turn, the below retail stocks to buy offer a compelling argument.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A questionable enterprise prior to the Covid-19 disaster because of the much-discussed death of America’s shopping malls, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) really took a beating when the SARS-Cov-2 virus first came knocking. Structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Simon Property focuses on shopping malls, outlet centers and community/lifestyle centers. During the worst of the pandemic, few people wanted to be around strangers.', 'However, the concept of retail revenge – or pent-up demand for activities and experiences denied – helped lift SPG from the 2020 doldrums. In the past 52 weeks, SPG gained more than 16% of equity value, a respectable performance. Notably, SPG swung higher as rumors hit that the Federal Reserve was contemplating interest rate cuts. Again, a relatively devalued dollar encourages spending.', 'To be fair, SPG suffers from question marks due to wider questions about the brick-and-mortar retail model. However, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a high-side target of $172. Thus, it could be one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top names in the big-box retail space, Target (NYSE:TGT) initially appeared intriguing because of the retail revenge phenomenon. However, management disclosed last year the impact that shoplifting had on profitability. Obviously, that didn’t seem like a particularly encouraging announcement considering wider sensibilities. Basically, Target was communicating that it had little recourse other than to suck it up or close down the most problematic stores.', 'However, late last year, Target reported a better-than-expected earnings print. As well, the company reported robust results for the Black Friday shopping season. All in all, the big-box retailer demonstrated that despite consumer challenges, shoppers were continuing to visit Target locations. That meant that the company enjoyed some brand power, a not-insignificant advantage in an ultra-competitive cycle.', 'Financially, Target enjoys a 15.7% three-year revenue growth rate, beating out 83.45% of its peers. Also, its return on invested capital (ROIC) – the ability to convert capital into profitable investments – comes in at 10.5%, better than 75.32% of the sector. Thus, TGT ranks among the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Bolingbrook, Illinois, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is a chain of beauty stores. While a relevant sector, a tough economic backdrop hurt investor sentiment. In the past 52 weeks, ULTA shares dipped more than 5%. With high inflation and high borrowing costs, many consumers opted for cheaper alternatives – the trade-down effect. However, if interest rates decline, ULTA could be one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'For one thing, with more people having more discretionary funds to spend, increased demand for pampering should be expected. Moving forward, we could see Ulta leveraging its on-site beauty salons. As well, consumers may opt for top shelf, higher-margin products. Both may help reinvigorate sentiment. Indeed, ULTA popped higher late last year, coinciding with lower interest rate rumors.', 'Financially, Ulta performs quite well with a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7%, beating out almost 77% of its rivals. However, the real star could be the ROIC which clocks in at 31%, above 96% of competitors. Thus, it’s an intriguing prospect for retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', 'Another beneficiary of a better-than-expected jobs report could be Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Practically a cultural icon at this point, Starbucks fuels a large chunk of the U.S. economy. How so? In addition to hiring countless thousands of people – thus providing first-time work experience for many – the brand also keeps workers focused. According to the National Coffee Association of USA, seven in 10 Americans drink coffee every week.', 'Invariably, a large volume of this consumption stems from Starbucks. Now, the narrative understandably encountered challenges in 2023. You can tell by its 52-week loss of almost 13%. That’s very un-Starbucks like. However, with the dollar rising in relative value due to higher interest rates, people naturally chose to save their greenbacks.', 'Moving forward, more people should have more dollars from more jobs being worked. That should give increased discretionary purchasing power. Also, because these dollars will be worth less over time, an incentive exists to do something with it.', 'Why not reward yourself with Starbucks? Analysts see a price target of $110, making SBUX one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'Mentioning Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as one of the retail stocks to buy may be controversial because of its impact. As The New York Times pointed out a few years back, mom-and-pop stores just can’t compete with the e-commerce juggernaut. So, Amazon’s giant vacuum cleaner continues to scour the nation, devastating small businesses and enlarging itself. It’s an ugly situation but you can’t argue with the results.', 'In the past 52 weeks, AMZN gained nearly 59% of equity value. Yes, it’s still off from its all-time highs. However, the security’s downturn in 2022 appears a forgotten memory. Further, if the Fed actually goes through with interest rate cuts, Amazon may have some more time with blue skies. In an inflationary cycle, more dollars will chase after fewer goods. As stated before, this should incentivize spending.', 'To be clear, AMZN is no discount, trading at 78.61X trailing-year earnings. However, the company enjoys a massive three-year revenue growth rate of 21.9%. Also, it features a very decent ROIC of 6.84%. Unsurprisingly, it’s a unanimous strong buy among 42 expert voices.', 'Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com', 'During the worst of the pandemic, a few retail stocks to buy offered surprising relevance. One such company was Nike (NYSE:NKE). A popular athletic apparel and sports equipment manufacturer, when enterprises shifted abruptly to remote work protocols, demand for traditional office attire declined. In its place were hoodies and sweatpants and other super-casual attire – things that Nike specializes in.', 'However, with the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy in 2022, NKE incurred a steep correction. Last year, shares were all over the map. In the past 52 weeks, NKE dropped more than 20% of equity value. Further, the company faces competitive pressures as small rivals aim to take market share in the athletic apparel ecosystem.', 'Still, for speculators, Nike may deserve a second look because of its brand and pricing power. For example, in the quarter ended November 2023, Nike’s gross margin stood at 44.6%. That was noticeably above the year-ago quarter’s print of 42.89%. This indicates that consumers overall gravitate toward Nike, making it one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: RYO Alexandre / Shutterstock.com', 'A contrarian idea among retail stocks to buy, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) undoubtedly presents risks. Yes, a currency that devalues over time incentivizes some action toward it, including spending it. Otherwise, if you hold the cash, you will basically incur a hidden tax. It’s just not a smart thing to do but to buy a car? That doesn’t seem very smart either.', 'However, the reality is that for many people in the U.S. – particularly those outside of metropolitan areas on the east coast – a personal vehicle is a necessity. That’s one of the reasons many Californians don’t like environmental protocols that attempt to push residents into more sustainable transportation. Having a car is an absolute necessity in many areas because the public transportation system is a joke.', 'But here’s another, more important factor at play: the cars on our roadways are old. In 2023, the average age of passenger vehicles hit a record 12.5 years. As advanced as reliability statistics have become, mechanical devices always break down.', 'Combined with possibly lower interest rates, more people may be attracted to replacement vehicles.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with SLB.', ""On January 24, 2024, Schlumberger Ltd (NYSE:SLB), the world's premier oilfield services company, filed its annual 10-K report with the SEC, providing a detailed overview of its financial performance and strategic direction. As of June 30, 2023, SLB boasted an impressive market capitalization of approximately $69.70 billion, with 1,427.39 million shares of common stock outstanding. The company, renowned for its technological innovation and leadership in energy services, has rebranded to SLB, reflecting its commitment to driving energy innovation for a balanced planet. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect the intricate details of the 10-K filing to provide investors with a clear understanding of SLB's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, thereby informing investment decisions and contributing to the wealth of knowledge on GuruFocus.com."", ""Brand and Technological Leadership: SLB's rebranding to SLB and its new logo symbolize the company's vision for a decarbonized energy future, building on nearly a century of technological innovation. With a global presence in over 100 countries and a workforce representing a vast array of nationalities, SLB's brand is synonymous with cutting-edge energy technology and digital solutions. The company's leadership in reservoir performance, well construction, and production systems is underpinned by a robust portfolio of proprietary technologies and services that drive efficiency and performance. This technological prowess is a cornerstone of SLB's competitive advantage, enabling the company to maintain a dominant market share and attract premium pricing."", ""Financial Resilience and Diversification: SLB's financial health is evidenced by its substantial market capitalization and diversified revenue streams. The company's operations span four divisionsDigital & Integration, Reservoir Performance, Well Construction, and Production Systemseach contributing to a balanced revenue mix. This diversification mitigates the risks associated with market volatility and enables SLB to capitalize on various growth opportunities across the energy sector. Furthermore, SLB's strategic joint venture in OneSubsea, which combines SLB's and Aker's subsea businesses, exemplifies the company's commitment to innovation and efficiency in subsea production, further solidifying its financial resilience."", ""Exposure to Market Cyclicality: Despite SLB's financial strength, the company is not immune to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. Fluctuations in oil and gas prices can significantly impact customer expenditures, leading to reduced demand for SLB's services and products. This cyclicality has historically led to periods of downturn, where SLB has experienced pressure on its financial performance. The company's reliance on the exploration, development, and production activities of its customers makes it susceptible to market downturns, which could adversely affect its revenue and profitability."", ""Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks: SLB's global operations expose it to various geopolitical and regulatory risks.

By leveraging its subsurface expertise, design capabilities, and global scale, SLB is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for low-carbon energy solutions. These ventures represent a forward-looking approach that could significantly contribute to SLB's growth and market leadership in the coming years."", ""Competition and Technological Disruption: SLB operates in a highly competitive industry where technological innovation and price differentiation are key competitive factors. The company faces competition from both large and small players, which could erode its market share if it fails to maintain its technological edge. Additionally, rapid technological advancements could lead to the emergence of disruptive technologies that challenge SLB's current offerings. Staying ahead of the competition and continuously investing in R&D will be crucial for SLB to maintain its leadership position."", ""Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Pressures: As societal and investor focus on ESG factors intensifies, SLB must navigate increasing expectations for sustainable practices and transparency. The company's operations, particularly in oil and gas, are under scrutiny for their environmental impact.

We plan to restart the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill in the first quarter to help manage our expectations in the first half of 2024 for continued strong demand together with scheduled mill maintenance outages and the final phase of the containerboard conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, AL mill. The Paper segment had very good results with volume slightly higher than expected and costs managed extremely well.""', '""Looking ahead as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter,"" Mr. Kowlzan continued, ""in our Packaging segment, we expect higher total corrugated products shipments from continued strong demand and two additional shipping days in the first quarter. Despite restarting the No. 2 machine at our Wallula Mill, containerboard volume will be lower due to downtime associated with the conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson Mill and a scheduled maintenance outage at our Counce, TN mill. Prices and mix should be slightly higher with the implementation of our announced January price increases partially offset by a decrease in the published benchmark prices that occurred late in 2023, with export prices fairly flat. In our Paper segment, we expect an improved mix to move prices slightly higher with flat sales volume. Recycled fiber and energy prices will be higher, and unusually cold seasonal weather will negatively impact usages and yields for energy, wood and chemicals along with higher operating costs associated with the restart of full operations at the Wallula mill compared to fourth quarter operations. Labor and benefits costs will have seasonal timing-related increases that occur at the beginning of a new year related to annual wage and benefit increases, the restart of payroll taxes, and share-based compensation expenses. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher and will include the significant first quarter impact of the conversion outage at our Jackson Mill which is estimated to be ($.16) per share. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $1.54 per share.""', 'We present various non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including diluted EPS excluding special items, segment income excluding special items and EBITDA excluding special items. We provide information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP in the schedules to this press release. We present our earnings expectation for the upcoming quarter excluding special items as special items are difficult to predict and quantify and may reflect the effect of future events. We currently anticipate special items in the first quarter of 2024 to include charges, fees, and expenses for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities at the Jackson, AL mill. We do not currently expect any additional significant special items during the first quarter; however, additional special items may arise due to first quarter events.', 'PCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.93 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aptiv PLC?', ""For Aptiv PLC, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.02%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aptiv PLC will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aptiv PLC would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +8.33%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Aptiv PLC doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 13% to US$545 following its latest full-year results. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$34b and statutory earnings per share of US$12.03. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Netflix ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Netflix's 48 analysts is for revenues of US$38.3b in 2024. This reflects a solid 14% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 35% to US$16.70. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$38.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.79 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", 'The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 14% to US$550. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Netflix, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$700 and the most bearish at US$335 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.', ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Netflix'shistorical trends, as the 14% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 14% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 7.9% annually. So it's pretty clear that Netflix is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Netflix's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -39.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $34.3 billion, down 16.1% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.37% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Phillips 66?', 'For Phillips 66, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.', 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Phillips 66 will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Phillips 66 would post earnings of $4.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.63, delivering a surprise of -3.14%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Phillips 66 doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', ""Among the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share for the quarter ended December 2023.

Did a lot of traveling, a lot of eating out, and emerged from the doldrums with a YOLO attitude, you only live once,"" Schneider elaborates. ""As I started to see those trends change, I started to realize I was talking to more and more people — not just women — but men and women who were talking about... \'this year I want to take care of myself more.\'""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're nearly one month into 2024. And for many people, a new year means new goals for the year ahead. Our next guest is calling 2024 the year of the vanity trade. Here with more is Michele Schneider, chief strategist at Marketgauge.com."", ""Good to see you. So we're talking about vanity stocks, which covers investments in beauty, skincare, self-help, diet drugs, and dating. Why do you think this is going to be the year? And what are some of the standouts for you?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, good to see you both. Well, let's start with the fact that last year, the market really depended on the consumer. And where did the consumer go? Did a lot of traveling, a lot of eating out, and emerged from the doldrums with a sort of YOLO attitude, right, You Only Live Once."", ""And as I started to see those trends change, I started to realize that I was talking to more and more people, and not just women but men and women, who were talking about, you know what, this year, I want to take care of myself more. I've neglected myself. I've gained weight."", 'So ozempium, you know, obviously hit the market. And then what does that trickle into? I want to take care of my skin. I want to wear nicer clothes. I want to work out.', 'And when I started to put that together, I started to look at all the stocks that really are relevant to that from a fashion chain like a Ralph Lauren, or a TJ Maxx, or a Columbia, or AEO to make up, which would be Coty and elf, or even Nu Skin. Then I started looking at things like dating. Maybe people would start dating, so Match and Bumble. Working out, I was particularly interested in Peloton.', ""And then in terms of the-- from the biomed space, companies like AbbVie and also companies that are making more injectables like Novo, for example. So I put that all together, I almost came up with a basket, if you will, of an ETF we could call vein. And it's an interesting basket because some of them are doing really well and some of them are still floundering near the lows and could emerge as the year goes on."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I like that ETF vein. I feel like that would catch on pretty quickly. Michele, this comes at a time though when we've been hearing more and more on these earnings calls too that discretionary spending is pulling back. Consumers are sort of becoming a little more cautious."", ""So if the spending is happening in the vanity space, where's the trade off? What are they doing instead? Like vanity instead of what?"", ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: I would say vanity instead of the discretionary spending that we've seen in a lot of recreational activities outside of the home, whether that would be travel and eating out, that kind of thing. I mean, we still have obviously a strong service economy. The numbers even that came out today showed the service industry is still strong."", ""But I would imagine that if we're going to cut back and then I could just look at it from a personal standpoint if-- and I'm not saying I'm doing this-- but if I were saying this is the year I'm going to just focus on me, where would I cut back? Most likely I would cut back on going out to eat because the food prices are still very high. And very quietly so far this year, Akiko, we're seeing sugar go up. We're seeing DBA, which is talk about ETFs, that basket of a lot of agriculture all of a sudden gapped up and keeps flying higher here."", ""So if you're going to say, well, I still need to feel good about myself. And I can feed my family, but I can still take care of myself. Because after all, at some point, people have to feel good about themselves in order to even take care of their families. That's where we're looking."", ""But you brought up a great point and that is the consumer in general. And that's why in this little thorn in the side of vanity, if you will, is ETF XRT, which is a nice talk about a basket, a nice basket of staples and discretionary stocks in the retail space that is really falling behind. And even as we're speaking today with SPY and QQQs making new highs in lots of the growth stocks, that is just sort of floundering and actually has been red a couple of times already this morning."", ""That could be an indication that we're not quite ready to maintain the high prices of the beauty stocks we talked about. And the ones that have been beaten up could go lower. So you know, it's always going to be timing, but keep an eye on XRT."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Michele, I want to take a deeper dive into some of these beauty stocks, especially when you look at the performance of elf over the past year up 183%. Whereas, you look at Estee Lauder down 53%. What are they doing right? What is it about either the product, the product mix, or the fundamentals of the business that are making them more of a standout?', ""MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, first of all, they are more broadly represented. Like Ulta, for example, would be a big carrier of it. I think also, believe it or not, it's a sexy name. And so you've gotten into a lot of people, oh, I love elf products. And whether they really love elf products compared to Estee Lauder products or Coty products, what is that really based on?"", ""So I think there's just been this overall mentality and they're priced well. Their products are priced well. But you can see just from that whole movement up, whether you're going to compare it to Estee Lauder or Coty."", ""And Coty is not doing too badly. It just hasn't really broken out yet. Yeah, that's like the NVIDIA of semiconductors, if you will. It's been more popular and therefore more investments and therefore more profits."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: We didn't even get into GLP-1 there. Michele, much more to come. We'll have to have you back on the show. Michele Schneider, Marketgauge.com strategist, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time."", 'MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Thank you so much.']"

However, the average price may be lower due to extra costs at Olympias.', 'As production increases, the all-in-sustaining costs are expected to decrease and could drop below $1,125 per ounce.', 'However, due to the high capital expenditure needed to develop Skouries, the free cash flow might not be as positive as originally anticipated. The free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023 is predicted to be approximately $15 million.', ""Further, as of the third quarter, the company's cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities summed up to $476.75 million. This amount is expected to increase to approximately $500 million for the most recent quarter.

As previously announced, this expectation assumes the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates. However, the company is currently in a consolidation phase, specifically in a triangle pattern, until the end of February.', 'During this period, it is important to accumulate the stock and trade short-term LIFO for about 50% of your position. It is also recommended to wait for clear indicators of an imminent breakout before moving further.', 'Eldorado Gold is forming an ascending triangle pattern, with resistance at $13.50 and support at $12.10.', ""This pattern is considered bullish, indicating the stock's value may increase soon. The resistance level of $13.50 is expected to be reached again more quickly. If the resistance level is crossed, we may see a breakout to $14.25 before the stock returns to $13.50, which will become the new support level. However, the gold price outlook may not be favorable in the short term, with significant fluctuations expected."", 'It may be a good idea to sell approximately 50% of the shares at a trading range of $13.25 to $13.65 (using the LIFO method) and anticipate potential higher resistance at $14.25 in the medium term. In contrast, if the gold price continues to decline, it may be wise to accumulate shares between $12.25 and $11.75, with potential support at $10.60 for a profitable outcome.', 'As always, watch the gold price like a hawk.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

With the introductions complete, I will turn the call over to Phebe."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11.668 billion, operating earnings of $1.288 billion and net earnings of $1 billion. Revenue is up $817 million, a strong 7.5% against the fourth quarter last year.Operating earnings are up $61 million and earnings per share up $0.06 or 1.7%. The year ago quarter had $52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings per share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favorably, particularly revenue and operating earnings.The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $1.97 billion, a very strong 10.4%, operating earnings by $231 million or 21.9% and net earnings by $169 million or 20.2% and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement.For the full year, we had revenue of $42.3 billion, up 7.3% and operating earnings of $4.25 billion, up 0.8% and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022.The fourth quarter in the year are $0.04 and $0.09, respectively, below consensus. It is important to note that consensus (inaudible) during the 2 weeks before this earnings release as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources. This miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year-end. As a result, Gulfstream was enabled to deliver 15 G700 as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks.While we miss consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year.Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity and backlog and any other items you might like to address."", 'Jason W. Aiken', ""Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up $2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts was nearly $132 billion. In terms of orders, the Aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio in both the fourth quarter and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion.The Defense segment had a book-to-bill of 0.7x in the fourth quarter and 1:1 for the full year.Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1x for the year, and all 4 segments were 1:1 or better.Turning to our cash performance. It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream [waters,] additional payments on Combat Systems international programs and continued strong cash performance in technologies.After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700.Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in the fourth quarter at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are, of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy submarine and shipbuilding plant. At 2.1% of sales, full year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing. So some of that naturally pushes into next year.As a result, we expect CapEx to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter. We also paid $360 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with 2 million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024.After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately $1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year. We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024.Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $343 million. That compares to $85 million and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around $320 million.Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16.8%, slightly below, but generally in line with our guidance.Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings.That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Thanks, Jason. First, Aerospace. The story on Aerospace has found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing growth of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $449 million. This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis.The sequential numbers are even stronger with a 35% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39 versus 27 in the third quarter of 2023. A strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption and improved supply chain response, leading to less out of station work, all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter.For the full year, revenue of $8.62 billion is up only $54 million from the prior year and operating earnings of $1.18 billion improved by $52 million on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin.Nevertheless, Aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter and the year because as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of the G700 in the fourth quarter and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go. That deprived us to slightly over $1 billion of revenue and close to $250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures.We were also enabled during the course of the year to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in the fourth quarter.So where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final technical inspection authorization. FAA function and reliability flight testing is almost done and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted.In the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their predelivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter.All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2x in the quarter and 1.2x for the year. Backlog increased $395 million sequentially and $938 million for the year. So Aerospace demand remains strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for a 2- to 3-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event and the second for a geopolitical event.I refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resulted conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. Aerospace backlog is up 72% since the first quarter of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity.In summary, Aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certification delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get the guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year.Next, Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $351 million are up 5.7% on a 40 basis point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at Ordnance and Tactical Systems and European Land Systems. It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume, higher volume of (inaudible) bridges and Eagles in Europe and new international tank programs.Not surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $140 million or 6.3% and earnings are up $51 million or 17% on the strength of a 130 basis point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, Combat had a very good year with a 1.1x book-to-bill driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank, growing demand on the munition side of the business and particular strength in Europe.By the way, Combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year. Operating earnings are up $72 million or 6.7%, with operating margin at 13.9% for the year.In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward.Turning to Marine. The powerful Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.408 billion is up 14.8% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 13.5% sequentially and 12.9% for the year. This was driven by Columbia-class construction and engineering volume, TAO volume and service contracts at back.Operating earnings are down 8.4% over the year ago quarter on a 160 basis point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at Electric Boat. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings.The EAC decreases were primarily driven by 2 factors: later than promised material to EB, which drove additional out-of-station work at EB; and quality problems from several vendors. On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work. We are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain.Marine Systems had a 1x book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards and began the year with a total backlog of nearly $46 billion.Jason will now give you some color on the Technologies group for which he has responsibility and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024."", 'Jason W. Aiken', ""The Technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of $305 million were down 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services. . GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments, defense, intel and federal civilian. Operating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50 basis point contraction in operating margin to 9.3% and that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance to break it down between the 2 businesses. GDIT's revenue was up in all 4 quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past 3 years.The same is true for Mission Systems' quarterly revenue performance with the exception of the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter saw us break through a log jam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products listing both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full year basis are quite favorable.With respect to order activity and backlog, the Technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a 1:1 book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totaling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before. They've got another $15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of $2 billion in awards under protest.Mission Systems had a great year as well, with the total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog. So much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time.To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion. So all in all, a great year for the Technologies group."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""So let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide rollup.In 2024, we expect Aerospace revenue of about $12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023. This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of '22. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280s as a result of the Gaza conflicts' impact on our Israel-based supplier.As I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in the second quarter and then well over 15% in the third and fourth quarters. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges.In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in '23. With the changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For '24, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to $8.5 billion, coupled with a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is a result of the strong order activity we saw in '23 and the demand signals we see in Europe. To the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business.As I noted earlier, the Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenues came in much stronger than expected, almost $1.6 billion against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about $12.8 billion with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024.In Technologies, 2023 revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses. 2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to $13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits and Mission Systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp-up on new programs.Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%. We see long-term low single-digit growth for the group and continued industry-leading margins.So for 2024, company-wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $46.3 billion to $46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%. We anticipate operating margin of 11%, up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.4. A reasonable range would be $14.35 to $14.45. On a quarterly basis, the first 2 quarters look a lot of like with very strong third and fourth quarters.In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we'll be laser-focused on operations.Nicole, back to you."", 'Nicole M. Shelton', 'Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""I was hoping you could touch on the 700 (inaudible). How many do you have ready for predelivery inspection from your customers? And also relative to confidence of when the deliveries could take place. I mean this is pretty much out of your control. The FAA has published a few rules last week that are pending and have to go through their process. I'm just curious, your confidence level for first quarter delivery versus, say, where you were in the fourth quarter, expecting deliveries by year-end."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', 'So we have 15 airplanes ready to go. And the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week, are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could in around the certification and where we are.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""Is there an 800 delivery assumed in the guidance for '24?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""So we're not going to go into what we've assumed in -- for any given airplane in our guidance. So let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last 8 years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have control, no control. And it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss, and these planes are going to get certified, but get certified on the FAA schedule."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America."", 'Ronald Jay Epstein', 'Maybe just circling back on your remarks, Phebe, around EB, but maybe more broadly, just kind of the ship industrial base. The DoD has been making some big investments, where do you see Virginia Class build rates ultimately getting Colombia to? Because it just seems like the supply chain and maybe just also from just a capacity perspective, you were just under capacitized. So I mean, any thoughts on that?', 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""So let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses in industry and in entire supply chain. And our manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in 2 respects. First, we had a really a stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base. That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy.We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market, those will remedy. But there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain.I'd say with respect to capacity at Electric Boat, we are nicely -- sufficient capacity in the moment to deal with the demand that we have -- we see at the moment. But should that demand signal increase in the near term or work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to the stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality. And that happens as new workers come down their learning curves, we benefited Electric Boat because we have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency, but still they need to come down their learning curves, and they're doing so nicely.I think to add a little bit of perspective to that. Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in '24 and about 30% on Colombia. So Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just needed continue to improve their productivity. So we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain.But I would finally mention the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain, and that helps the entire supply chain plan."", 'Ronald Jay Epstein', 'Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-on. Are we capacitized enough to meet the demand that (inaudible) would require having an extra Virginia Class every 3 years?', 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""So I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy. But let me tell you the best thing we can do for (inaudible) the moment is get back to 2 a year production. It's one step at a time."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Jason Gursky at Citigroup."", 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the G400 and how that plane seems to be performing from a market acceptance perspective and kind of the pipeline that you're seeing for that aircraft? I'm just kind of curious how that segment of your market is shaping up there as we come into the new year?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', 'So the plane is performing very nicely in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market. And so we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service.', 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Okay. Great. And then your comments on Combat and the potential for some orders converting into revenue coming out of Europe in the second half of the year, (inaudible) your guidance. But I'm just kind of curious how far into the year can we get those orders and actually convert them into revenue?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Well, it depends on what the orders are for on faster transaction material like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So we factored to the best of our ability, the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan. So to the extent that there is upside, it will be, I think, largely on the ammunition programs that execute at a faster rate. And to the extent that we can speed up even further, the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions that should help as well.But we think we -- look, in all cases, we give you a very balanced, I'd say 50-50 plan with opportunities and risks, and we're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to David Strauss at Barclays."", 'David Egon Strauss', ""Phebe, any thoughts on how the budget process for '24 might actually play out here, given that we're quickly approaching the potential for a sequester?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""So we have factored in all known funding into our plan. And should we see an extensive continued -- continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because every CR plays out a bit differently. And to the extent that we have a sequester, then we have factored some of that but -- clearly, you can't do all of it into your plan. So we'll adjust accordingly. But we are hopeful that the Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, particularly in these times, given the threat environment."", 'David Egon Strauss', ""Okay. Jason, I wanted to ask about free cash flow and capital deployment, maybe help with some of the big moving pieces. I mean, obviously, inventory was a big drag, but advance has helped a lot, your cash taxes have been really high. How do those all factor in '24? And I assume your guidance includes nothing as usual for capital deployment. How should we think about that given you have very little in maturities this year?"", 'Jason W. Aiken', ""Yes. So when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in '24 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in '24. So the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit.We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years. But right now, if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the Aerospace group, a fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion.When you think about it, we got a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years and all the deposits were coming in. So that more than offset any effect of inventory build. So as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady 1:1 book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at 100% conversion plus or minus for that business.Combat Systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work in process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So that will continue for a couple of years.The Technologies group is a steady provider above -- well above 100% conversion. And the Marine Systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects, we're coming through that now, and we'll see what the future holds, as Phebe alluded to, in terms of Navy investment.But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year. If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got $500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision. And we'll look at all options as we always have.I think we've got great opportunity for stepped-up share repurchases as more, I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. We looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment. And that factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital.So if we can get past that in March, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""If you think about it, the demand signals we see and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling. And one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on and just give you guys some perspective. When we talk about a 1:1 book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes, it's not a forecast. So just keep that in mind."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Great color on Gulfstream. You gave some numbers around the lost revenues and profit that slipped into '24 from the G700, which would imply north of 20% margins for the G700 and given you have quite a few built up already. Any color you could give on profit profile of the G700 relative to maybe the 650 and the 500 and 600?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', 'Can you repeat the last part of your question, it was kind of coming in.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', 'Sure. Sorry. It was more just the profit profile of the G700 relative to the 650 and the 500, 600 as it entered service just because you gave the revenues of...', 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Yes, the 700 comes in at accretive margins. But as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, as we talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues. And as I noted in my remarks, mix pricing, out of station work, all impacted. So I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is it really balanced plan, not quite the question you asked, but I'd stick with that and I think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Okay. And then if I could ask one more on the defense side of the business, just given a lot of what your peers are talking about as well. And you have pretty robust demand in Marine and Combat, but earnings growth tends to be below revenue growth. So just given inflation and mix, how do you think about GD's ability to continue to grow defense profit? It seems like Combat is seeing some of that."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Combat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of -- what happened to the industrial base in the Marine group, and it also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily. So we drive increased profitable growth. That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Seth Seifman at JPMorgan."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""I wanted to start off asking about Combat. And just the 3% growth guide, I guess, even if we adjust for some seasonality, I might have thought that the activity levels that we're seeing here in the early what we saw in the second half of '23, would it lead to some really quite robust growth in the first half, perhaps even double digit?And then being at 3%, would it imply something like flat or down in the second half? Am I not thinking about that cadence properly? Or is there some reason for the growth to really step off or come down in the second half?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""No. I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier. And so this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid- to upper single digits over and toward the higher upper single digits over our plan period.But we've given you the plan that given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple of quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on. But the demand is there."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Sure. Sure. Okay. Excellent. And then on Aerospace, I guess it's probably about 2 years ago that you gave us kind of a multiyear look at the Aerospace business and the expectations there as the demand started to gather. Since that bunch of stuff has happened, I think the demand has probably been a little stronger than expected. We've also seen some supply chain issues, some certification pushouts. As we think about sort of a multiyear outlook for Aerospace in terms of deliveries and profitability, is that something you can update at this time?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Yes. So we're going to deliver 160 airplanes that's in our plan this year. I will say that '25 will be more deliveries and '26 even more deliveries. But at this point, given the issues that you mentioned, it's -- we're not going to be any more granular than that. We owe you additional fidelity as time goes on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.', 'Noah Poponak', ""Phebe, maybe just following on that, but a little bit bigger picture. I was curious to hear you talk about how you're managing supply versus demand in this pretty unique business jet market? Because if you go to $12 billion in revenue, that's run rating $3 billion a quarter, and based on the change in backlog, I know that's imperfect. But directionally, the order rate had made it to $3 billion a quarter, but it's now slowed a little bit, and we're trying to figure out where this market settles out.And so you want to get customers airplanes and you want to grow, but I know you also want to maintain backlog and that you're more focused on pricing and margins than units. And so if you're going to $12 billion and then as you just said to Seth, you're going to go higher, I guess, you'd be burning backlog. So how do you think about managing that multiyear supply versus demand in that market?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Well, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog given the robust backlog we have and given the robust pipeline that we have. We're off to a good start this year. So I don't see anything that particularly drive an unhealthy burn through the backlog. We see -- we have believed for some time and it is turning out to be the case that new clean sheet airplanes drive incremental demand. And we're certainly seeing that, and we don't see much of an abatement in that."", 'Noah Poponak', 'Okay. So it sounds like you potentially expect the -- that quarterly order rate to pick back up moving forward as your new airplanes are more entrenched in the market.', 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Well, look, the order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome, and we would expect additional orders supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders per quarter, but we've seen nice demand, continuing interest and a very solid pipeline. To me, those are the sort of foundational elements that we rely on for looking on a going-forward basis, looking at what production can ultimately be."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen."", 'Cai von Rumohr', ""Good numbers. So Gulfstream -- 2 issues. First, you mentioned the Hamas attack and the impact on the G280, maybe tell me the status of that and what that means in terms of your ability to get deliveries.And secondly, I think the bigger question is, by my quick math, it looks like your guidance for '24 implies an 18% margin -- incremental margin at Gulfstream, which seems low given the good margins you should be getting on the G700."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""You're right. Let's agree that we're not -- we shouldn't in any given moment infer something from an implied margin. I think, as you know, probably better than most the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple times. And I think in this environment where we are encouraged by the supply chain, but we've got more ways to go. We think that we have given you a very, very balanced plan, and I really stick to that plan. That's how I think about it.With respect to the 280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They are continuing to perform with retirees and management. And as I said, we factored all of that into our expectations for the year."", 'Cai von Rumohr', ""So is that -- I mean, I still don't quite understand the 18% margin. Is that sort of a P&L drag, the fact that there's -- they can't get enough for the timing?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""I wouldn't say it's a P&L drag. It's just a reality of the multiplicity of factors that are impacting us. '24 is a pivotal year. We saw a significant improvement in the supply chain during the course of the year, but frankly, allowed us to increase production in the latter half of the year. If you recall, we were delivering between 24 and 25 aircraft, and we delivered 39 in the fourth quarter, that makes us pretty optimistic that we can continue to increase production. But we are cautious about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. All indicators are that they're doing quite well. But it -- this is one step at a time, and there's more risk. As I say, we're optimistic, but we've got a ways to go."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research."", 'George D. Shapiro', ""Just following up a bit on Cai's question. I mean the incremental margin was like 38% here in this fourth quarter, which is pretty extraordinary. So -- I mean what changes to really knock that down to the point that Cai's comment?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""You guys are reverse engineering incremental margin, and it's almost impossible to deal with and the complexity of this business. I would infer nothing from it. Look, let's talk about the underlying capabilities. Gulfstream has a lot of operating leverage. They've always been a good -- since we acquired them at GD years ago, they have been strong operating performers with very good margin performance and gross margins coming out of their operations. That won't change, but the mix of business, the level of any given quarter's timing around supply chain and its impact on out of station work and mix of service, Jet Aviation, all of those things are contributing.So there is nothing systemic other than those issues that you know and they are temporary and we will work through the supply chain issues. But there's nothing systemic that you concern you about where we stand on Gulfstream and its ability to increase margins, earnings and revenue over time here."", 'George D. Shapiro', 'And one for you, Jason. The unbilled receivables were down like $450 million in the quarter. Is that just AJAX catching up.', 'Jason W. Aiken', ""It's a little bit AJAX and it's a little bit of the ongoing payments on our other large international program and Combat Systems. Those are the 2 big pieces, yes, George."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Robert Spingarn at Melius Research.', 'Robert Michael Spingarn', ""Phebe, the marine guide implies about $340 million in sales growth. And in the past, you've talked about Colombia driving $400 million to $500 million of growth per year. So could an economic price adjustment for Virginia Class be a meaningful source of sales and operating income for Marine in 2024?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""Well, EPA adjustments can always be a good source of income. Look, I think the way that we've always talked about the marine growth being somewhat lumpy, $300 million to $500 million in any given year. But in the next 2 years, we expect between $600 million and $1 billion in per annum growth. So the growth is there. It just comes in on a lumpier basis than you might -- than one might want, but it is there.And -- so with respect to Virginia and any EPA adjustments, we're continuing to work with the Navy. We had contemplated the impact of Colombia prioritization as had the Navy on Virginia, and that's just a work in progress as we through all the particulars with the Navy. But we think we've given you a pretty good indicator of this year's revenue, and we'll adjust it accordingly if anything changes on the upside."", 'Robert Michael Spingarn', ""So just to be clear, there's nothing in there for an adjustment yet."", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""No. I think it's premature to put numbers in before you've got an agreement with..."", 'Nicole M. Shelton', 'And Audra, I think we have time for just one more question.', 'Operator', ""We'll take that question from Peter Arment at Baird."", 'Peter J. Arment', ""Phebe, maybe just to add on and just speak on Marine. Just you've given us a lot of details on what some of the pressures were. But we've seen throughout the industry, the Sense Production Act has been used to kind of improve some capacity at Rocket Motors and munitions. Is there an opportunity? I mean I know the Navy is a really good partner and customer. Is there an opportunity for to get some relief and free up some additional resources for you at the yards?"", 'Phebe N. Novakovic', ""So we have been pretty well resourced by the Navy and for many, many years in anticipation of particularly the Colombia and Block V. So I think from our perspective, where we really need some assistance and continued assistance from the Navy is stabilization of on-time delivery and quality coming out of the supply chain. So I think that as we go through this year, I'm sure there will be additional opportunities for us to work with the Navy and find some ability to relieve those pain points that remain in the supply chain.And listen, before we leave, I just want -- this is for many of you may know, this is Jason's last earnings call. And I wanted to thank him for his excellent years of service as a CFO. He will be missed, but his work will continue at Technologies. So I'm sure all of you will join me in congratulating Jason on a superb CFO job well done over the years."", 'Nicole M. Shelton', 'Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11.668 billion, operating earnings of 1.288 billion, and net earnings of 1 billion. Revenue is up 817 million, a strong 7.5% against the fourth quarter last year.', 'Operating earnings are up 61 million, and earnings per share are up $0.06 or 1.7%. The year-ago quarter had 52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings-per-share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favorably, particularly revenue and operating earnings. The sequential results are even better.', ""Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by 1.097 billion, a very strong 10.4%; operating earnings by 231 million, or 21.9%; net earnings by 169 million, or 20.2%; and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings, and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement."", ""For the full year, we had revenue of 42.3 billion, up 7.3%; and operating earnings of 4.25 billion, up 0.8%; and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease, mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher, and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022. The fourth quarter and the year are $0.04 and $0.09, respectively, below consensus. It is important to note that consensus [Technical difficulty] during the two weeks before this earnings release as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources. This miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year-end."", ""As a result, Gulfstream wasn't enabled to deliver 15 G700, as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks. While we missed consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year. Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity and backlog, and any other items he might like to address."", 'Jason Aiken -- Executive Vice President, Technologies, and Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up 2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, was nearly 132 billion.', 'In terms of orders, the aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2-to-1 book-to-bill ratio in both the fourth quarter and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion. The defense segments had a book-to-bill of 0.7 times in the fourth quarter and 1-to-1 for the full year. Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the year and all four segments were 1-to-1 or better. Turning to our cash performance.', 'It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream orders, additional payments on combat systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700.', ""Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in the fourth quarter at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are, of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. At 2.1% of sales, full year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing, so some of that naturally pushes into next year. As a result, we expect capex to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter."", 'We also paid $360 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to 1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with 2 million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately 1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year.', 'We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to 343 million. That compares to $85 million and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around 320 million.', ""Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16.8%, slightly below but generally in line with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Jason. First, aerospace. The story in aerospace is found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream service business, and the continuing growth of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, aerospace had revenue of 2.74 billion and earnings of 449 million.', 'This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger with the 35% increase in revenue, coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39, versus 27 in the third quarter of 2023. A strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption, and improved supply chain response, leading to less out-of-station work all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter.', 'For the full year, revenue of 8.62 billion is up only 54 million from the prior year, and operating earnings of 1.18 billion improved by 52 million on a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin. Nevertheless, aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter and the year because, as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of the G700 in the fourth quarter and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go. That deprived us of slightly over $1 billion of revenue and close to 250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures.', 'We were also unable, during the course of the year, to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in the fourth quarter. So, where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final technical inspection authorization. FAA function and reliability flight testing is almost done, and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted. In the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their pre-delivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter.', 'All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.2 times for the year. Backlog increased 395 million sequentially and 938 million for the year. So, aerospace demand remained strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and Jet Aviation.', 'I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for two- to three-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event and the second for a geopolitical event. I refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resulting conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace.', ""Aerospace backlog is up 72% since the first quarter of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity. In summary, aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certification delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and an improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get to guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year."", 'Next, combat systems. Revenue in the quarter of 2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of 351 million are up 5.7% on a 40-basis-point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at ordnance and tactical systems and European land systems.', 'It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume; higher volume of Piranhas, bridges, and Eagles in Europe; and new international tank programs. Not surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up 140 million, or 6.3%; and earnings are up 51 million, or 17%, on the strength of a 130-basis-point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, combat had a very good year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill, driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank, growing demand on the munitions side of the business, and particularly strength in Europe.', ""By the way, combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year. Operating earnings are up 72 million, or 6.7%, with operating margin of 13.9% for the year. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity, and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward."", 'Turning to marine. The powerful marine systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of 3.408 billion is up 14.8% over the year-ago quarter. Revenue is also up 13.5% sequentially and 12.9% for the year.', 'This was driven by Columbia-class construction and engineering volume, T-AO volume, and service contracts at Bath. Operating earnings are down 8.4% over the year-ago quarter on a 160-basis-point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at Electric Boat. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings. The EAC decreases were primarily driven by two factors: later-than-promised material to EB, which drove additional out-of-station work at EB; and quality problems from several vendors.', 'On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work. We are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain. Marine systems had a 1 times book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards that began the year with a total backlog of nearly 46 billion.', ""Jason will now give you some color on the technologies group for which he has responsibility, and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024."", 'Jason Aiken -- Executive Vice President, Technologies, and Chief Financial Officer', ""The technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of 305 million were down 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services."", ""GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments: defense, intel, and federal civilian. Operating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50-basis-point contraction in operating margin to 9.3%. And that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance to break it down between the two businesses."", ""GDIT's revenue was up in all four quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past three years. The same is true for mission systems' quarterly revenue performance, with the exception of the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter saw us break through a logjam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products, lifting both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full year basis are quite favorable."", ""With respect to order activity and backlog, the technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a 1-to-1 book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totaling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before. They've got another 15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of 2 billion in awards under protest."", ""Mission systems had a great year as well with a total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog, so much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time. To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion. So, all in all, a great year for the technologies group."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the companywide rollout. In 2024, we expect aerospace revenue of about 12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023.', ""This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of '22. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280 as a result of the Gaza conflict's impact on our Israel-based supplier. As I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in the second quarter, and then well over 15% in the third and fourth quarters. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges."", ""In combat systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in '23. With a changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For '24, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to 8.5 billion, coupled with a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is a result of the strong order activity we saw in '23 and the demand signals we see in Europe."", 'To the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business. As I noted earlier, the marine group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenue came in much stronger than expected, almost 1.6 billion, against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about 12.8 billion, with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024.', 'In technologies, in 2023, revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses. 2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to 13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits and mission systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp-up on new programs. Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%.', 'We see long-term low-single-digit growth for the group and continued industry-leading margins. So, for 2024, companywide, we expect to see revenue of approximately 46.3 billion to 46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%. We anticipate operating margin of 11%, up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.40.', 'A reasonable range would be $14.35 to $14.45. On a quarterly basis, the first two quarters look a lot alike, with very strong third and fourth quarters. In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth.', ""We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we'll be laser-focused on operations. Nicole, back to you."", 'Nicole Shelton -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?', '', 'Operator', ""Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research."", 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, I was hoping you could touch on the 700. Not a surprise.', ""How many do you have ready for pre-delivery inspection from your customers and also relative to confidence of when the deliveries could take place? I mean, this is pretty much out of your control. The FAA has published a few rules last week that are pending and have to, you know, go through their process. I'm just curious your confidence level for first quarter delivery versus, say, where you were, you know, in the fourth quarter expecting deliveries by year-end. Thanks."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'So, we have 15 airplanes ready to go, and the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week, are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could in -- around the certification and where we are.', 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Is there an 800 delivery assumed in the guidance for '24?"", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, we're not going to go into what we've assumed in -- for any given airplane in our guidance. So, look, let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last about eight years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have control -- no control, and it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So, I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss, and these planes are going to get certified but get certified on the FAA schedule."", 'Myles Walton -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'All right. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America."", 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Maybe just circling back on your remarks, Phebe, around EB, but maybe more broadly, just kind of the ship industrial base. It -- you know, the DOD has been making some big investments.', ""You know, where do we -- where do you see Virginia-class build rates ultimately getting, Columbia, too, because it just seems like, you know, the supply chain and maybe just also from just a capacity perspective, we're just under-capacitized? So, I mean, if you have any thoughts on that."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses and an industry and an entire supply chain. And our manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in two respects. First, we had an -- really, a stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base."", ""That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages, caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy. We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market. Those will remedy."", ""But there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain. I'd say with respect to capacity, at Electric Boat, we are nicely capacity -- we have sufficient capacity in the moment to deal with the demand that we have -- we see at the moment. But should that demand signal increase in the near term, we'll work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to this stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality."", ""And that happens as new workers come down their learning curves. We've benefited from Electric Boat because they have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency. But still, they need to come down their learning curves. And they're doing so nicely."", ""You know, I think to add a little bit of perspective to that, Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in '24 and about 30% on Columbia. So, Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just need to continue to improve their productivity so we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain. But I would finally mention, the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain, and that helps the entire supply chain plan."", 'Ron Epstein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-on. Are we capacitize enough to meet the demand that AUKUS would require, you know, having an extra Virginia class every three years?', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy. But let me tell you, the best thing we can do for AUKUS in the moment is get back to two-a-year production. It's one step at a time."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Jason Gursky at Citigroup."", 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, everybody.', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Phebe, I was -- good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the G400 and how that plane seems to be performing from a market acceptance perspective and kind of the pipeline that you're seeing for that aircraft. I'm just kind of curious how that segment of your market is shaping up there as we come into the new year."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'So, the plane is performing very nicely, in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market. And so, we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', ""OK. Great. And then your comments on combat and, you know, the potential for some orders converting into revenue coming out of Europe in the second half of the year, that's not -- that doesn't sound like it's implied in your guidance. But I'm just kind of curious, you know, how far into the year can we go get those orders and actually convert them into revenue?"", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Well, it depends on what the orders are for. On faster transaction material like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So, we factored, to the best of our ability, the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan.', ""So, the extent that there is upside, it'll be, I think, largely on the armament munition programs that execute at a faster rate. And to the extent that we can speed up even further the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity, as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions, that should help as well. But we think we -- you know, look, in all cases, we give you a very balanced, I'd say, you know, 50-50 plan with opportunities and risks, and we're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to David Strauss at Barclays."", 'David Strauss -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, David.', 'Jason Aiken -- Executive Vice President, Technologies, and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning.', 'David Strauss -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Phebe, any thoughts on how the budget process for '24 might actually play out here given that we're quickly approaching, you know, the potential for a sequester?"", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, we have factored in all known funding into our plan. And should we see an extensive and continued continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because, you know, every CR plays out a bit differently. And to the extent that we have a sequester, then we have factored some of that, but, you know, clearly, you can't do all of it into your plan. So, we'll adjust accordingly."", 'But we are hopeful that the Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, you know, particularly in these times given the threat environment.', 'David Strauss -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'OK. Jason, I wanted to ask about free cash flow and capital deployment. You know, maybe help with some of the big moving pieces. I mean, obviously, inventory was a big drag, but advances helped a lot.', ""Your cash taxes have been really high. How do those all factor in '24? And I assume your guidance includes nothing, as usual, for capital deployment. How should we think about that given you have very little in maturities this year? Thanks."", 'Jason Aiken -- Executive Vice President, Technologies, and Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in '24 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in '24. So, you know, the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit."", ""We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years. But right now, if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the aerospace group, you know, fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion. When you think about it, we had a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years and all the deposits were coming in. So, that more than offset any effect of inventory build."", ""So, as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady 1-to-1 book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at 100% conversion, plus or minus, for that business. Combat systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work in process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So, that'll continue for a couple of years. The technologies group is a steady provider, above -- well above 100% conversion."", ""And the marine systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects. We're coming through that now. And we'll see what the future holds, as Phebe alluded to, in terms of Navy investment. But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year."", ""If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got 500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So, we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision."", ""And we'll look at all options, as we always have. I think we've got great opportunity for stepped-up share repurchases as more -- I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. You know, we looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment, and that, you know, factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital. So, if we can get past that in March, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""You know, if you think about it, the demand signals this year and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling. And one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on and just give you guys some perspective. You know, the -- when we talk about a 1-to-1 book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes. It's not a forecast."", 'So, just keep that in mind.', 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies."", 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Thank you for the time.', 'Jason Aiken -- Executive Vice President, Technologies, and Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Great color on Gulfstream. You gave some numbers around the lost revenues and profit that slipped into '24 from the G700, which would imply, you know, north of 20% margins for the G700, and then you have quite a few built up already. Any color you could give on the profit profile of the G700 relative to maybe the 650 and the 500 and 600?"", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, can you repeat the last part of your question? It was kind of coming in.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Sure. Sorry. It was more just the profit profile of the G700 relative to the 650 and the 500 and 600 as it entered service just because you gave the [Inaudible]', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, they come in -- yeah. The 700 comes in at accretive margins. But as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, as we've talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues."", ""And as I noted in my remarks, mix, pricing, out-of-station work all impact it. So, I think -- you know, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is a really balanced plan, not quite the question you ask, but I'd stick with that and I think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins."", 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""OK. And then if I could ask one more on the defense side of the business, just given a lot of what your peers are talking about as well and you have pretty robust demand in marine and combat, but earnings growth tends to be below revenue growth. So, just given inflation and mix, how do you think about GD's ability to continue to grow defense profits? It seems like combat is seeing some of that."", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Combat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of what happened to the industrial base in the marine group. And it also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So, for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily so we drive increased profitable growth."", ""That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Seth Seifman at J.P.

I wanted to start off by asking about combat and just the 3% growth guide. I guess even if we adjust for some seasonality, I might have thought that the activity levels that we're seeing here in the -- or what we saw in the second half of '23 would lead to some really quite robust growth in the first half, perhaps even double-digit, and then being at 3% would imply something like flat or down in the second half. Am I not thinking about that cadence properly or is there some reason for the growth to really, you know, step off or come down in the second half?"", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""No, I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier. And so, this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid- to upper single digits over and toward the higher -- upper single digits over our planned period."", ""But we've given you the plan that given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple of quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on. But the demand is there."", 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Sure. Sure. OK. Excellent.', ""And then on aerospace, I guess it's probably about two years ago that you gave us kind of, you know, a multiyear look at the aerospace business and the expectation there as the demand started to gather. You know, since then, a bunch of stuff has happened. I think, you know, the demand has probably been a little stronger than expected. We've also seen some supply chain issues, some certification pushouts."", 'You know, as we think about sort of a multiyear outlook for aerospace in terms of deliveries and profitability, is that something you can update at this time?', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, we're going to deliver 160 airplanes that's in our plan this year. I will say that '25 will be more deliveries; and '26, even more deliveries.

Good morning, everyone.', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Phebe, maybe just following on that but a little bit bigger picture, I was curious to hear you talk about how you're managing supply versus demand in this pretty unique business jet market because if you go to 12 billion in revenue, that's run rating 3 billion a quarter. And based on the change in backlog, I know that's imperfect, but directionally, the order rate had made it to 3 billion a quarter, but it's now slowed a little bit and we're trying to figure out where this market settles out. And so, you know, you want to get customers airplanes and you want to grow, but I know you also want to maintain backlog and that you're more focused on pricing and margins than units. And so, if you're going to 12, and then as you just said to Seth, you're going to go higher, I guess you'd be burning backlog."", 'So, how do you think about managing that multiyear supply versus demand in that market?', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, look, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog given the robust backlog we have. And given the robust pipeline that we have, we're off to a good start this year. So, I don't see anything that particularly drives a unhealthy burn through the backlog. We see -- you know, we have believed for some time, and it is turning out to be the case, that new clean sheet airplanes drive incremental demand."", ""And we're certainly seeing that, and we don't see much of an abatement in that."", 'Noah Poponak -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'OK. So, it sounds like you potentially expect the -- you know, that quarterly order rate to pick back up moving forward as your new airplanes are more entrenched in the market.', 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, look, our order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome, and we would expect additional orders, supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So, we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders per quarter, but we see nice demand, continuing interest, and a very solid pipeline.

I just don't understand --"", 'Phebe Novakovic -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Cai, so -- right. So, look, let's agree that we're not -- we shouldn't, in any given moment, infer something from an implied margin. I think, as you know probably better than most, the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple, multiple times.

With respect to the 280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They continue to perform with retirees and management.

On more traditional valuation measures, the current forward P/E ratio on the S&P 500 of 16.7x is below the recent peak of 22x; the current price/sales ratio of 2.3x is below the 1Q22 ratio of 3.0x; and the cur rent dividend yield of 1.6% is higher than the 1Q23 yield of 1.3%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the importance of payout ratios, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios.\xa0', ""Investors have traditionally shown a strong preference for dividend stocks because of their ability to generate income. When seeking stocks that provide a steady income stream, investors often lean toward companies that have a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time. Such companies typically maintain low payout ratios, indicating robust cash generation capabilities. Payout ratio is a measure indicating the percentage of a company's net income or free cash flow that is distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it implies that the company has the potential to sustain or even increase its dividend payments in the future. Adam Kramer, who oversees the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund, discussed payout ratios in a report. Here is what he said:"", '""It\'s important to analyze the stability of a company’s cash flows when assessing the level of payout. When the payout ratio is more than 50%, you always stress test that ratio.""', 'A high payout ratio indicates that a company is allocating a substantial portion of its earnings towards dividend payments, resulting in a reduced amount of funds available for potential investments in the future growth of the business. In a study conducted by Wellington Management, dividend-paying stocks were categorized into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, known as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, included the lowest dividend payers. The second quintile stocks showed better performance than the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods from 1930 to 2022, while the first and third quintile stocks tied for the second place, outperforming the Index 67% of the time.', ""The study revealed that the success of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks could be attributed to the sustainability issues associated with the excessive dividend payouts of the first quintile. Additionally, the average dividend-payout ratio since 1979 for the first two quintiles of dividend payers within the Russell 1000 Index was highlighted in the study. The first-quintile stocks had an average dividend payout ratio of 74%, while the second quintile had a more moderate 40% average payout ratio. Maintaining a high payout ratio, such as 74%, may pose challenges for a company if it undergoes a decline in earnings. In such circumstances, the company might be compelled to reduce its dividend, a move often interpreted in financial markets as a sign of weakness. This reduction frequently leads to a decline in the company's stock price."", 'Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

This is the second Fortune 100 company to drop CVS in the last year. Could shifts like these open up opportunities for smaller pharmacy benefit management companies? Jordan Feldman, Rightway CEO joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what makes the company stand out—and what the benefits landscape could look like soon."", 'Feldman believes that what differentiates Rightway from traditional pharmacy benefit manager is its model. Feldman calls the traditional model a “taxi meter approach,"" with companies benefiting from members spending more on drugs, rather than focusing on customer experience. Feldman highlights Rightway\'s “pharmacist in the family approach,” that, according to Feldman, allows for greater customer assistance that ideally would ultimately allow members to make the right decision for their needs. “The pharmacy benefits space is at an inflection point,” insists Feldman, who sees sustainability only being possible if members are at the center.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, Tyson Foods is dropping CVS as its pharmacy benefit manager today sending another signal to pharmacy industry giants that maybe we could see further changes on the horizon. It's the second Fortune 100 company to drop CVS in the last year. And the food producer has switched to a much smaller outfit called Rightway, which guarantees 15% savings on pharmacy costs."", 'The CEO of Rightway, Jordan Feldman, joins us now, along with our senior healthcare reporter Anjalee Khemlani. Jordan, thanks so much for being here. So what makes your model any different than the PBMs that are already out there? And how do you get that 15% savings?', ""JORDAN FELDMAN: Thanks for having me. If you look at the traditional PBM model, they're essentially on a taximeter approach. The more money that members spend on drugs and the higher cost drugs that are dispensed, the more money they make. They utilize rebates. They utilize spread pricing. And because they have so much financial misalignment, the member experience is essentially nonexistent. They have no incentive, no infrastructure, no technology to truly engage the member."", ""And what that's created is double-digit compounding increases in pharmacy costs over the last decade. Now what Rightway saw was an opportunity-- an opportunity to really transform that member experience, to take the pharmacy benefit and financially align the model such that there's no spread pricing and no rebates, but really focus on the utilization piece of pharmacy benefits-- how do we support, how do we guide, how do we advocate, how do we generate technology to help members understand cost of drugs and use all of that support that we really call a pharmacist and the family approach to help impact the trend and cost associated with the pharmacy benefit."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Jordan, Anjalee here. I wonder, you know, we're looking at this in a time where there's definitely been discussion about the changes needed in PBM. You see that in Congress. You see that in the general discussion with the payers. I actually had a conversation with the California Blue Shield CEO, who was one of the first to start this last year with their dropping of CVS. But they did keep them for specialty benefits. But there is something to be said about the conversation happening. He had this to say about what the expectation should be."", 'PAUL MARKOVICH: Our mission, I think, drives us to try to make the system better. What I would love to see from payers, because we set the rules of the system, I would love to see us change the rules of the system. So that they facilitate that kind of innovation and consumer focus. So for example, that would include bringing health care into the digital age, retiring fax machines.', ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Of course, the fax machine being a different issue altogether. But I'm sure you could appreciate the idea that there needs to be movement here. I wonder what your thoughts are on that and what can be done and who really needs to be taking on that burden."", ""JORDAN FELDMAN: Look, the pharmacy benefits space is at an inflection point. They built a model that essentially traps margin and profits within the supply chain. And it's not working for employees, and it's not working for their planned sponsors. So what we need to introduce to the pharmacy benefit is a financially aligned model."", ""You can't have a PBM that makes more money when you spend more money and more drugs are dispensed. And I think as Paul alluded to, the entirety of this innovation needs to be with the member at its core. If we're really going to transform and innovate around the pharmacy benefit, it's not just the price of it but we certainly need to work on that, we need to have transparency."", ""But it's about the utilization. We have expensive brand name drugs. We have specialty drugs that offer biosimilars, that offer preferred brands, that offer generic drugs. And we need to be able to support and educate that member, such that they know about these alternatives, such that they can pull up an app, as Paul alluded to, in a modern consumer-driven way where they could see the universe of options about what drug they're on, why they're on it, how much it costs, what the alternatives are. And if we can introduce that consumerism to the pharmacy benefits landscape, we can start to change that whole cost dynamic that's nonexistent from the traditional PBMs today.""]"

A mere $1,000 invested in Mastercard at its IPO in May 2006 would be worth over $104,050 today.', ""Today, Mastercard is one of the world's largest financial companies, worth over $412 billion in market cap. Now that it's a behemoth, future investment returns probably won't be as lucrative."", 'However, Mastercard can still be an excellent stock to buy and hold, depending on the answers to three crucial questions. Here are the questions and some potential answers for investors interested in this fintech stock.', ""Mastercard is one of the world's leading payment networks. It's the line of communication between a merchant or point of sale and the banks or lenders that hold your money. The company makes money by charging a small fee on each transaction on its network. Over time, consumers have gradually shifted away from cash to noncash payment methods like debit and credit cards and online payments."", ""This has fueled many years of growth for significant payment networks like Mastercard. Since Mastercard's fee is a percentage of the payment volume it processes, it can be lumpy at times when consumers cut back or spend more. However, over the past decade, revenue has grown at an average of 12% annually."", ""Ironically, Mastercard's most recent growth is above its long-term averages, which is impressive considering annual revenue is over $24 billion today."", ""It's a similar story for earnings. Mastercard has outpaced its long-term averages in recent years. Some may be a bump from the COVID-19 stimulus in 2020 to 2022, but it's still great to see. To answer the question, yes. Mastercard is still growing its top and bottom lines just fine."", 'When you boil it down to the basics, investing is about finding companies that continually create value. In other words, can a business keep making more money despite competition biting at its heels?', ""Mastercard is one of a tiny circle of prominent payment networks. That group generally includes Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover (outside China). It's even smaller in America, where Visa and Mastercard dominate the market, according to research by The Motley Fool."", ""Which banks and lenders issue which brand of payment card depends significantly on agreements they make with the payment networks, so tracking how Mastercard is holding up isn't easy. But one of my favorite metrics, return on invested capital (ROIC), can help provide some answers."", ""Investors should want to own companies with a high ROIC because it means they're efficient at making money. When you can put a dollar into a business and get $1.50 out, it's a sign that the business is efficient and profitable. Competition isn't squeezing your financials."", ""I typically look for rates above 15%, and as you can see, Mastercard passes that benchmark quite easily. It's a sign of a high-quality business."", ""The world's most fabulous company can be a lousy stock if you overpay for it. Investors should know that valuation always matters. Fundamentally speaking, Mastercard is a great business that's still growing at a healthy pace."", ""Here is where you need to be careful. Most investors know how awesome Mastercard is, so the stock routinely trades at a high valuation. Currently, that's a forward P/E of almost 31."", ""Analysts have steadily lowered their growth estimates since those estimates peaked in mid-2021. That could be due to stimulus money drying up, putting more pressure on consumers' wallets. Still, Mastercard is looking at long-term earnings growth averaging over 15%."", ""To gauge how attractive that looks, I use the PEG ratio. It compares valuation to growth to contextualize how much an investor pays for a stock's growth. I look for PEG ratios of 1.5 or less, and Mastercard is sitting just above that at an even 2.0."", ""Mastercard is a market-beating stock with the fundamentals and growth to remain a stellar long-term investment. While the stock might be a bit expensive today for the growth you're getting, an investor thinking years out will probably be fine buying the stock here and letting the company grow into its valuation."", 'Feel free to dollar-cost average so you have some cash left to take advantage of a sale if the market gets shaky and sends shares lower.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

With a market capitalization of approximately $115.2 billion as of June 23, 2023, and 241.64 million shares of common stock outstanding as of January 19, 2024, Lockheed Martin continues to assert its dominance in the defense sector. The company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, audited by Ernst & Young LLP, reflect a robust financial position, underpinned by significant programs such as the F-35 Lightning II, which alone generated 26% of the total consolidated net sales and 64% of Aeronautics' net sales in 2023.

This dedication to cutting-edge R&D not only solidifies Lockheed Martin's position as an industry leader but also ensures its long-term competitiveness by staying ahead of emerging threats and technological advancements."", ""Dependence on Government Contracts: Lockheed Martin's financial health is heavily reliant on contracts with the U.S. Government, which accounted for 73% of its total consolidated net sales in 2023. This dependence exposes the company to risks associated with changes in government priorities, budgetary constraints, and political uncertainties. Any significant reduction or delay in government spending could adversely impact Lockheed Martin's business operations and financial performance."", ""Workforce Recruitment and Retention Challenges: As the defense industry evolves, Lockheed Martin faces the challenge of attracting and retaining top talent, particularly in technical fields and critical skills areas.

Failure to effectively manage human capital could hinder Lockheed Martin's ability to innovate and execute on complex projects."", ""Global Security Environment: The complex and evolving global security landscape presents Lockheed Martin with opportunities to expand its international customer base. The company's strategic focus on 21st Century Security, which aims to integrate advanced networking and operational technologies into national defense, positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for sophisticated defense solutions worldwide."", ""Strategic Partnerships and Digital Transformation: Lockheed Martin's pursuit of strategic partnerships, particularly with commercial companies, and its multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance digital infrastructure, offer significant growth prospects. These initiatives are designed to increase efficiencies, foster innovation, and improve collaboration across the business, thereby enhancing Lockheed Martin's competitive advantage and opening new avenues for expansion."", ""Geopolitical Tensions and Economic Conditions: Geopolitical conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and macroeconomic factors, including inflation and potential recessions, pose threats to Lockheed Martin's operations. These external factors can disrupt supply chains, affect demand for products and services, and lead to increased competition, potentially impacting the company's financial stability and growth prospects."", 'Regulatory and Compliance Risks: Lockheed Martin operates in a highly regulated industry, subject to stringent government oversight and compliance requirements. The company must navigate complex regulations, including export controls, anti-corruption laws, and anti-boycott provisions, which can impose significant constraints on its international business dealings and expose it to legal and financial risks.', ""In conclusion, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) exhibits a strong market presence, bolstered by its technological prowess and a diverse portfolio of defense products and services. However, its reliance on government contracts and the challenges of workforce management underscore the need for strategic agility. Opportunities for growth lie in the dynamic global security environment and the company's digital transformation efforts. Nonetheless, geopolitical tensions and regulatory complexities present ongoing threats that require vigilant risk management. As Lockheed Martin navigates these SWOT dynamics, its ability to leverage strengths, mitigate weaknesses, seize opportunities, and counteract threats will be critical to its continued success in the defense industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Higher mortgage rates will impact the company’s top line in the quarter. This, along with the slight shift in its mix toward build-to-order homes (which won’t deliver until 2024), is an added headwind for the quarter. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have reflected these headwinds. That said, low-existing homes for sale have been driving demand for new homes in the market. This tailwind is likely to have helped the company to partly mitigate the headwind in the quarter.Moreover, PulteGroup’s execution of initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes, prudent land investment strategy and affordable product offerings, are expected to have partially offset the negatives.PulteGroup expects home deliveries to be approximately 8,000 units compared with 8,848 homes delivered a year ago.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")).', 'Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs"").', 'In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide segment site rental gross margin, segment services and other gross margin and segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as site rental revenues and capital expenditures.', 'Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:', 'Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.', 'AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations or rent free periods, the revenues or expenses are recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.', 'FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily real estate depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.', 'Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, core leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well as to forecast future results. Separately, we are also disclosing Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations, which is outside of ordinary course, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends. Management believes that identifying the impact for Sprint Cancellations provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings (including as Adjusted for Impact of Sprint Cancellations) is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.', 'Net Debt is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our overall debt position and future debt capacity. Management uses Net Debt in assessing our leverage. Net Debt is not meant as an alternative measure of debt and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing our leverage.', 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures', 'Adjusted EBITDA.

We define site rental billings as site rental revenues exclusive of the impacts from (1) straight-lined revenues, (2) amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (3) contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions.', 'Core leasing activity. We define core leasing activity as site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of (1) the impacts from both straight-lined revenues and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (2) payments for Sprint Cancellations, where applicable.', 'Non-renewals. We define non-renewals of tenant contracts as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates, exclusive of non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations, where applicable.', 'Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.', ""Sustaining capital expenditures.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the importance of payout ratios, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios.\xa0', ""Investors have traditionally shown a strong preference for dividend stocks because of their ability to generate income. When seeking stocks that provide a steady income stream, investors often lean toward companies that have a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time. Such companies typically maintain low payout ratios, indicating robust cash generation capabilities. Payout ratio is a measure indicating the percentage of a company's net income or free cash flow that is distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it implies that the company has the potential to sustain or even increase its dividend payments in the future. Adam Kramer, who oversees the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund, discussed payout ratios in a report. Here is what he said:"", '""It\'s important to analyze the stability of a company’s cash flows when assessing the level of payout. When the payout ratio is more than 50%, you always stress test that ratio.""', 'A high payout ratio indicates that a company is allocating a substantial portion of its earnings towards dividend payments, resulting in a reduced amount of funds available for potential investments in the future growth of the business. In a study conducted by Wellington Management, dividend-paying stocks were categorized into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, known as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, included the lowest dividend payers. The second quintile stocks showed better performance than the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods from 1930 to 2022, while the first and third quintile stocks tied for the second place, outperforming the Index 67% of the time.', ""The study revealed that the success of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks could be attributed to the sustainability issues associated with the excessive dividend payouts of the first quintile. Additionally, the average dividend-payout ratio since 1979 for the first two quintiles of dividend payers within the Russell 1000 Index was highlighted in the study. The first-quintile stocks had an average dividend payout ratio of 74%, while the second quintile had a more moderate 40% average payout ratio. Maintaining a high payout ratio, such as 74%, may pose challenges for a company if it undergoes a decline in earnings. In such circumstances, the company might be compelled to reduce its dividend, a move often interpreted in financial markets as a sign of weakness. This reduction frequently leads to a decline in the company's stock price."", 'Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best MLP dividend stocks with sustainable payout ratios discussed among others in this article.', 'Photo by Scott Graham on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds as of Q3 2023 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 30%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them.

We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices.

We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate.

The company, a diversified defense contractor known for its aeronautics, defense, mission, and space systems, faced a challenging year due to a significant pre-tax charge on the B-21 program. Despite this, Northrop Grumman reported a record backlog and growth in sales, driven by robust global demand for its products and services.', ""The company's sales in the fourth quarter increased by 6 percent to $10.6 billion, contributing to a 7 percent increase in annual sales to $39.3 billion. However, the year was marked by a substantial pre-tax charge of $1.56 billion associated with the B-21 program, which is in the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase. This charge led to a net loss of $535 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter. For the full year, net earnings were reported at $2.1 billion, or $13.53 per diluted share, including the B-21 charge and an after-tax mark-to-market pension and other post-employment benefits (OPB) expense."", ""The B-21 charge was primarily due to macroeconomic factors impacting costs and supplier negotiations. This highlights the challenges defense contractors face in managing long-term fixed-price contracts amid economic volatility. The company's performance is critical as it reflects the health of the aerospace and defense industry, which is heavily reliant on government contracts and subject to economic and political fluctuations."", ""Despite the B-21 charge, Northrop Grumman's financial achievements include a record backlog of $84.2 billion and a strong cash flow performance. The backlog is indicative of the company's ability to secure new contracts and the ongoing demand for its defense products. Operating cash flow for the year was $3.9 billion, with adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion. These metrics are vital for the company's ability to invest in new technologies, manage debt, and return capital to shareholders."", 'Key financial metrics from the income statement and balance sheet include:', '""Our team delivered a strong finish to the year in 2023. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, significantly exceeded our sales guidance and beat EPS consensus absent the B-21 charge we identified as a possibility this time last year,"" said Kathy Warden, chair, chief executive officer and president.', ""This commentary underscores the company's resilience and the strategic importance of its products and services. The company's guidance for 2024 reflects continued strong sales and earnings growth, with free cash flow expected to grow at a greater than 15 percent compound annual growth rate through 2026."", ""Northrop Grumman's performance in 2023 was a mix of strengths and challenges. The record backlog and sales growth are positive indicators of the company's market position and future revenue streams. However, the B-21 charge points to the risks associated with complex defense programs. The company's ability to navigate these challenges while maintaining strong cash flow is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic planning."", ""For value investors, Northrop Grumman's solid backlog and projected cash flow growth suggest a potentially attractive long-term investment, provided the company can effectively manage the risks inherent in its industry. The company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders may also appeal to those looking for steady returns in a volatile market."", 'For more detailed insights and financial analysis, visit GuruFocus.com, where we provide in-depth research and up-to-date data for informed investment decisions.', 'Explore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Northrop Grumman Corp for further details.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Reported EPS is $1.29, expectations were $1.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shannon Drage, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Drage. You may begin.', 'Shannon Drage: Thank you, Camilla, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2023 fourth quarter earnings. My name is Shannon Drage, the Director of Investor Relations. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or Slide 2 of the presentation, dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of non-GAAP measures which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the earnings release as well as the presentation are available at zionsbancorporation.com. For our agenda today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons will provide opening remarks.', ""Following Harris' comments, Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results. Also with us today are Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Kyriakakis, Chief Risk Officer; and Derek Steward, Chief Credit Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled for one hour. I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons."", ""Harris Simmons: Thanks very much, Shannon, and we welcome all of you to our call this afternoon. As Shannon mentioned, Chris Kyriakakis is joining our call today as our new Chief Risk Officer and we want to welcome him. Chris was formerly our Chief Audit Executive and he is replacing Keith Maio, who recently retired after 32 years of really phenomenal service with Zions in a variety of senior positions. I'd like to start with comments on Slide 3, which includes some themes, which are particularly applicable to Zions. Our financial performance this quarter reflects the unusual circumstances of past year, as events last spring were the catalyst for an acceleration of deposit betas across the industry. We've been proactive in managing our balance sheet, making adjustments to our hedging strategy, working with clients to bring back on balance sheet deposits that we'd steer to off-balance sheet money market funds in times of surplus liquidity."", ""And we've demonstrated our ability to effectively manage interest rate and liquidity risk in a very dynamic environment. In the fourth quarter, we've seen the deposit mix stabilize and deposit costs start to level out. Net interest margin and net interest income were stable in the quarter. We continue to have a higher concentration of more costly funding sources that is typical for us. And we believe in the near-term that reducing our reliance on funding priced at or near wholesale rates combined with continued deposit pricing discipline, regardless of the future rate path, presents a meaningful opportunity to improve revenue performance. In the medium to long-term, we remain focused on improving shareholder returns by growing profitable small-business and commercial customer relationships by emphasizing growth in our capital markets and wealth management businesses and continuing to move away from single-product, loan-only, and other less profitable relationships."", ""In 2023, we exited two national lending businesses that produced few deposits and we're experiencing declining levels of profitability. And we changed our approach to mortgage-lending, as part of our focus on improved profitability. We continue to invest in the business and in enabling technologies to deliver the products and services that our customers need and which enhance the customer experience, all while managing expense growth to nominal levels. We have an established track record for managing risk and underwriting credit [with better than pure] (ph) performance. We believe that the combination of these efforts will result in improved financial outcomes for our investors in years ahead. Turning to Slide 4, we've included key financial performance highlights for the quarter and for the full year."", 'We reported a period-end loan balance increase of 3.8% for the full year and 1.6% in the current quarter. Customer deposit balances were flat for the full year and were up 2.4% in the quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 77%. Net charge-offs as a percent of loans were just 6 basis points both in the quarter and for the full year, down from an already low 8 basis points reported in the prior year. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.3% compared to 9.8% in the prior year. Moving to Slide 5. Linked-quarter diluted earnings per share was down $0.35 to $0.78 per share, on net earnings of $116 million, due to the impact of the FDIC special assessments combined with lower non-interest income. Turning to Slide 6. Our fourth quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $262 million, down from $272 million.', ""The linked-quarter decline was attributable primarily to lower non-interest revenue. Versus the year-ago quarter, PPNR was down 38%, as the increase in our cost of funds exceeded the increase in earning asset yields. So with that high-level overview, I'm going to ask Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail related to our financial performance. Paul?"", ""Paul Burdiss: Thank you, Harris. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining. I'll begin with a discussion of the components of pre-provision net revenue. Over three-quarters of our revenue is from the balance sheet through net interest income. Slide 7 includes our overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart shows the recent five-quarter trend for both. Net interest income on the bars and the net interest margin in the white boxes were consistent with the prior quarter as the repricing of earning assets kept pace with rising funding costs. Additional detail on changes in the net interest margin is outlined on Slide 8. On the left-hand side of this page, we've provided a linked-quarter waterfall chart outlining the changes in key components of the net interest margin."", 'The 14 basis point adverse impact associated with deposits, including changes in both rate and volume, was offset by the positive impact of loan repricing and higher money market and securities yields. Non-interest-bearing sources of funds continued to serve as a significant contributor to balance sheet profitability. The right-hand chart on this slide shows the net interest margin comparison to the prior-year quarter. Higher rates were reflected in earning asset yields, which contributed an additional 106 basis points to the net interest margin. This was more than offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs, which when combined with the increased value of non-interest-bearing funding, adversely impacted the net interest margin by 168 basis points.', 'Overall, the net interest margin declined by 62 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. Moving to non-interest income and revenue on Slide 9, customer-related non-interest income was $150 million, a decrease of 4% versus the prior quarter, due to lower loan servicing fees primarily attributable to the sale of certain mortgage servicing rights recognized in the third quarter. The remainder of customer-related fees were relatively in line with the prior year as the year-over-year decrease in capital markets revenue was offset by improved commercial account fees. Within capital markets, customer interest rate swap-related revenue in 2023 was adversely impacted by loan demand and the interest rate environment. This headwind was largely offset as investment in new product capabilities has resulted in growth in other sources of capital markets revenue.', 'We remain confident that we are poised for meaningful growth in capital markets activity and revenue. Our outlook for customer-related non-interest income for the full year of 2024 is moderately increasing relative to the full year 2023. The chart on the right side of this page includes adjusted revenue, which is the revenue included in adjusted pre-provision net revenue and is used in our efficiency ratio calculation. Adjusted revenue decreased 16% from a year ago and decreased by 2% versus the third quarter due to the factors noted previously. Adjusted non-interest expense shown in the lighter blue bars on Slide 10, was essentially flat to the prior quarter at $489 million. Reported expenses at $581 million increased $85 million, due to the $90 million in FDIC special assessment costs recognized in the quarter.', ""Our outlook for adjusted non-interest expense is slightly increasing in 2024 relative to 2023. Risks and opportunities associated with this outlook include our ability to manage technology and employment costs. Slide 11 highlights trends in our average loans and deposits over the past year. On the left side, you can see that average loans increased slightly in the current quarter. As loan demand remains soft, our expectation is that loans will be stable at year-end '24 when compared to year-end '23. Now turning to deposits on the right side of this page, average deposit balances in the fourth quarter increased slightly, as growth in customer deposits were offset by declines in brokered deposits. The cost of deposits shown in the white boxes increased during the quarter to 206 basis points from 192 basis points in the prior quarter."", 'As measured against the fourth quarter of 2021, the repricing beta on total deposits including brokered deposits and based on average deposit rates in the fourth quarter was 39% and the repricing beta for interest-bearing deposits was 60%. Slide 12 includes a more comprehensive view of funding sources and total funding [trends] (ph). The left side of the chart includes ending balance trends. Short-term borrowings have decreased $8 billion since the first quarter of 2023, as customer deposits have grown and earning assets have declined. On the right side, average balances for our key funding categories are shown along with the total cost of funding. As seen on this chart, the rate of increase in total funding cost at 15 basis points in the current quarter has continued to decline compared to the prior three quarters.', 'Slide 13 shows non-interest-bearing demand deposit volume trends. You can see that the recent trend in demand deposit attrition appears to be flattening. Although demand deposit volumes have been declining over the past six quarters, as customers move into interest-bearing alternatives, the contribution to the net interest margin shown in the white boxes and therefore the value of the demand deposit portfolio has increased. Moving to Slide 14, our investment portfolio exists primarily to be a ready storehouse of funds to absorb customer-driven balance sheet changes. On this slide, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last five quarters. The investment portfolio continues to behave as expected. Maturities, principal amortization, and prepayment-related cash flows were over $700 million in the third quarter.', ""With this somewhat predictable cash flow, we anticipate that money market and investment securities balances combined will continue to decline over the near term, which will be a source of funds for the balance sheet. The duration of the investment portfolio, which is a measure of price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, is slightly shorter compared to the prior year period estimated at 3.6% currently versus 4.2% one year ago. This duration helps to manage the inherent interest-rate risk mismatch between loans and deposits. With the larger deposit portfolio assumed to have a longer duration than our loan portfolio, fixed-rate term investments are required to balance asset and liability duration. Moving to Slide 15, we've provided the projected trend of AOCI, accumulated other comprehensive income, in -- based on an expected accretion and interest-rate impacts based on the forward curve as of December 31st."", 'AOCI improved to $2.7 billion from $3.1 billion in the prior year, largely due to principal amortization in the securities portfolio combined with interest-rate swap maturities. We expect based on the current forward curve that AOCI will decline by about $900 million cumulatively over the next eight quarters. Slide 16 provides information about our interest-rate sensitivity, which differs in content and format compared to prior quarters. While we provided standard parallel interest-rate shock sensitivity measures in the appendix of this presentation, we believe a more dynamic view of interest-rate sensitivity is most relevant in the current environment. Noted in the bar chart on the far right side of this page, modeled net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2024 is 2.4% higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, using the implied forward path of interest rates at year-end and assuming a static balance sheet.', '100 basis point parallel up and down shocks of this implied forward outcome suggests about 2% of interest-rate sensitivity around that figure. This modeled analysis reveals that our balance sheet while asset sensitive using traditional measures is positioned for net interest income growth if short-term rates fall faster than long-term rates. Utilizing this model outcome and overlaying management expectations, for balance sheet changes in deposit pricing, we believe that net interest income will -- in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be stable to slightly increasing when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our outlook is that full-year net interest income will be slightly decreasing in 2024 when compared to 2023. Risks and opportunities associated with this outlook include realized loan growth, competition for deposits and a path of interest rates across the yield curve.', 'Moving to Slide 17, credit quality remains strong. Classified loans increased $56 million, driven by the commercial real estate portfolio, while non-performing assets decreased $4 million. Net charge-offs were 6 basis points of loans in the quarter. Loan losses in the quarter were somewhat granular and largely associated with our commercial loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is 1.26% of loans, a 4 basis point decrease over the prior quarter due to a modest improvement in our economic outlook. As we know it is a topic of interest, we have included information regarding the commercial real estate portfolio with additional detail included in the appendix of this presentation. Slide 18 is a reminder of the discipline we have maintained over the past decade as it relates to the commercial real estate portfolio growth.', 'We have chosen our partners carefully and our growth has remained well below peers over time. Slide 19 provides an overview of the commercial real estate portfolio. CRE represents 23% of our loan portfolio with office representing 15% of total CRE or 3% of total loan balances. Credit quality measures for the total CRE portfolio remain relatively strong though criticized and classified levels increased in the quarter. Overall, we continue to expect the CRE portfolio to perform well with limited losses based on the current economic outlook. Our loss-absorbing capital position is shown on Slide 20. The CET1 ratio continued to grow in the third quarter to 10.3%. This, when combined with the allowance for credit losses, compares well to our risk profile, as reflected in the low-level of ongoing net charge-offs.', 'We expect to maintain solid regulatory capital while managing to a below-average risk profile. Slide 21 summarizes the financial outlook provided over the course of this presentation. As a reminder, this outlook represents our best current estimates for the financial performance for the full year of 2024 as compared to 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. As we move to the question-and-answer section of the call, we request that you limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.

So Demchak wants his Pittsburgh-based bank to ""move into that next level"" and be known ""coast to coast as a ubiquitous standard brand.""', '""Scale matters,"" he added. ""We’re going to have to play that game.""', 'Demchak’s comments are stoking a new debate about the path forward for the nation’s biggest regional banks following the turmoil of 2023. Can they still thrive in that pocket between a colossus like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and thousands of tiny community banks, or do they need to consolidate and get much bigger to ensure their long-term survival?', 'Many of these banks are generally on more stable ground than they were during the first half of last year when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered panic about the strength of many other mid-sized financial institutions across the US.', 'Their stocks even surged late in 2023 as investors became more convinced the Federal Reserve was ready to start cutting sky-high interest rates as early as March. Such a move would help mid-sized banks that watched their profits plunge as deposits became more expensive.', 'Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards', 'But it is not yet clear when or if those cuts will happen, and bank stocks have fallen back at the start of 2024 as policymakers push back on market expectations for a loosening in the first quarter.', 'This uncertainty means regional banks will continue to struggle with a key profitability measure known as net interest income — which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay out on their deposits.', 'Income fell at many regional banks during the fourth quarter, and some said they expect it to fall during 2024 as well. That includes PNC, which said it expects net interest income to drop 5% this year.', 'But Demchak’s bigger concern is existential: He said last week that his bank needs to get bigger so it can exist in a category that would give PNC the ""quasi support that the giant banks have"" during times of crisis.', 'This was not the first time Demchak has made this point. He also did so in December while speaking at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in New York. When asked then if he would consider acquiring another bank, he said, ""Scale matters today more than it ever has.""', 'Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo decided to ask Demchak about this topic again last week during PNC’s fourth quarter earnings conference call, and Mayo summed up his reaction to the CEO’s survival-of-the-fittest guidance with one word: ""Wow.""', 'Demchak’s comments served as ""a very clear advertisement"" that PNC is looking to buy other banks over time, Mayo told Yahoo Finance.', '""I see this advertisement to buy targets as more of an announcement for the next three years, not the next three quarters,"" he added.', 'Not all of Demchak’s regional rivals agree with his view. ""I do not think scale is the answer for a bank like Key,"" KeyCorp (KEY) CEO Chris Gorman told analysts last week. Key is a regional bank based in Cleveland.', '""It\'s not something you have to have,"" added M&T Bank (MTB) CFO Daryl Bible. M&T is a Buffalo, N.Y.-based regional lender.', 'PNC has in the past used acquisitions to get bigger during times of industry-wide stress. During the 2008 financial crisis, it was encouraged by the US government to buy Cleveland rival National City for $5.2 billion, which basically doubled its size.', 'Demchak has since used more acquisitions over the last decade to establish a foothold in nearly every top metro area in the country. His last was a $11.6 billion deal for the US operations of Spanish banking giant BBVA that closed in 2021. PNC now has roughly $561 billion in assets.', 'Read more: 5 ways to transfer money from one bank to another', 'The CEO tried last year to get even bigger. PNC was asked by the FDIC to submit a bid to acquire the operations of San Francisco lender First Republic, which would have given it a much larger foothold on the West Coast.', 'But it lost that auction in the early hours of May 1 to JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest and most profitable lender.', 'Demchak, 61 years old, was a late arrival to the world of regional banking. He got his start on Wall Street, working for JPMorgan in the 1990s. While there, he became head of structured finance and was well known for helping develop credit default swaps and selling them to investors.', 'Demchak arrived at PNC, a bank based in the area where he grew up, when he was 40. He served as CFO and head of corporate and institutional banking before becoming CEO in 2013.', 'He has periodically been mentioned or considered as a potential candidate to run much bigger banks before Bank of America (BAC) chose Brian Moynihan as its CEO and Wells Fargo (WFC) appointed its current boss Charlie Scharf. But he has chosen to stay in Pittsburgh.', 'Not all industry observers agree with Demchak’s latest argument that regional banks will drag unless they merge.', '""It\'s a great soundbite,"" said Gerard Cassidy, bank analyst for RBC, but ""that\'s not reality. The reality is that banks have relationships.""', 'Market share — or ""density"" in specific businesses — trumps national scale, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told Yahoo Finance.', 'Scott Siefers, an analyst with Piper Sandler, agreed that ""the whole game seemed to change in 2023,"" and that ""what most people have concluded is that banks are just simply going to have to get bigger to compete.""', 'But there are a lot of hurdles to that consolidation, he said, from high interest rates to the Biden administration’s skeptical view of big mergers.', '""Longer term, I don’t think there’s much dispute that PNC will be active in the consolidation of the industry,"" he added.

Pfizer's stock has features that could attract different types of investors. Here are some of its key attractions, and how they could fit with various portfolio strategies."", 'Core business model: Pfizer has a diversified portfolio of products that reduces its exposure to patent expirations and market competition. Unlike some of its rivals, which rely heavily on one blockbuster drug for most of their revenue, Pfizer currently has no single product that accounts for more than 15% of its annual sales.', 'During the pandemic, its COVID-19 solutions were an exception to this rule, but Pfizer is returning to its normal strategy based on a ""strength in numbers"" approach to value creation. This conservative-leaning strategy makes Pfizer a less-risky pharma stock to own, as it rarely experiences volatile swings in its top line.', 'Now, its post-pandemic performance is a glaring exception to this historical trend. But Pfizer does appear to be getting back to business as usual, so to speak.', 'Growth outlook: The bad news is that Wall Street thinks Pfizer will deliver only low-single-digit revenue growth over the balance of the decade, thanks to a mix of new competition in key therapeutic areas, an ongoing portfolio churn, and some key setbacks in the clinic in the recent past. This situation could change with a major win in the clinic or a savvy business-development move. But for now, Pfizer appears to be on a low-growth trajectory.', ""Valuation: Despite these challenges, Pfizer's stock is attractively priced at the moment. The company's shares are trading at only 12.6 times projected earnings, which is low for a major drug manufacturer. The company also offers a generous dividend yield of 5.91%, which is much higher than the average S&P 500 stock or short-term government bonds. However, the company's high payout ratio of 89% and modest growth prospects raise some doubts about the sustainability of its robust dividend program."", ""Dividend growth: Pfizer has raised its cash distribution to shareholders at a compound annual growth rate of 4.91% over the prior 10 years. That's about average for a megacap company. As such, Pfizer's stock doesn't stand out as a top-tier dividend-growth vehicle."", ""Due to its limited growth prospects, Pfizer doesn't screen as either a top value or growth play. However, its low earnings multiple and high yield make it an intriguing income play. While Pfizer may have to pull back on growing its payout in the short term, the drugmaker should be able to continue to pay a top-shelf yield for the foreseeable future."", ""Keeping with this theme, the company's low valuation also gives income investors a decent margin of safety. The stock is unlikely to drop much further after last year's 43.8% decline, combined with this year's anticipated return to low-single-digit top-line growth."", ""Pfizer seems best suited to an income-generating role in a well-diversified portfolio.

Sometimes, even if a business is doing well, investors might turn their back on it for one reason or another.', 'That can be your opportunity to seize upon a beaten-down stock and become part owner in a compelling business. Here are two such stocks you might consider scooping up as 2024 starts.', ""Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) is trading down by around 37% over the trailing 12 months at the time of this writing. That's a considerable drop from where the stock was trading a few years ago at the height of its pandemic-era successes fueled by its blockbuster COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral treatment."", 'In 2022, Pfizer became the first company in the history of the pharmaceutical industry to record revenue of over $100 billion. But in the first nine months of 2023, revenue totaled $44 billion, a notable difference due to the steep decline in sales of its COVID-19 products.', ""Profits for that nine-month period came to $5.5 billion on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and $9.9 billion on an adjusted basis.\xa0 This post-pandemic decline was inevitable at some point. And Pfizer's revenue total in the first nine months of 2023 was still about 13% higher than what it reported in the same period in 2019, before the pandemic."", ""Products that fueled Pfizer's financial performance in the first nine months of 2023 included its Prevnar vaccines (for pneumococcal diseases), Nurtec (a migraine medication the company acquired when it purchased Biohaven Pharmaceuticals), the Vyndaqel family of medicines (for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy), Xeljanz (for multiple ailments including rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis), and Ibrance (a first-line treatment for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer)."", 'The pandemic era of growth was short-lived, but the company earned billions in profits on the back of these products and immediately got to work planning for the next era of regulatory and business wins.', 'That era could be getting ever nearer. Pfizer is in the thick of an 18-month period when it plans to launch 19 new products or label expansions, which are estimated to add $20 billion in annual revenue by 2030. The company is also targeting another $25 billion in annual revenue by 2030 due to business deals.', 'Pfizer continues on a streak of acquisitions, most recently with its purchase of Seagen, which significantly boosted its oncology portfolio. Income investors will be happy to know that Pfizer pays a dividend, and due to its fluctuating stock price in recent months, that yield has risen to nearly 6%.', ""The dividend has increased by about 17% over the trailing-five-year period. There's still plenty to like about this stock, and patient investors can benefit from steady income and its long-term growth strategy over the next five to 10 years."", ""Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) is trading down by about 47% from where it was one year ago. While some growth stocks have recovered along with the market's rebound in past months, some businesses -- particularly those with heavy exposure to discretionary levels of consumer spending -- are still struggling."", ""This has been a notable factor behind Etsy's beaten-down stock price. Other issues have played a role as well, including fluctuating profitability, a slowdown in gross merchandise sales (GMS) and revenue, and in new-customer acquisitions."", ""However, the tide might be turning, slowly but surely. It's also important to note that from a pre-pandemic comparison, the business is still making substantial progress from a growth perspective. Let's look at some key facts and figures."", 'In the third quarter of 2023, Etsy reported revenue of $636 million; GMS of $3 billion; and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $182 million. Those figures represented year-over-year growth rates of 7%, 1.2%, and 9%, respectively.', 'However, on the basis of a four-year compound annual growth rate, those figures jumped 34% for revenue, 26% for GMS, and 44% for EBITDA. Looking at the most recent quarter, active buyers totaled just shy of 92 million, up 4% from one year ago and 109% from four years ago.', 'Etsy also reactivated 6 million buyers in the third quarter of 2023, 19% more than it did in the same quarter in 2022. The company has work to do, but the signs of progress are there. And recent workforce reductions -- plus the divestiture of Elo7, known as the Etsy of Brazil but a lagging portion of its business -- should make a difference in future quarters.', 'Profitability is improving, too, with $224 million in profits on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the first nine months of 2023. Investors might find that even a small position in this stock pays off over the next several years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the healthcare industry, you can go directly to the 5 Cities With The Best Hospitals In The US.', 'The healthcare industry stands amongst the fastest-developing sectors in the world, as evidenced by the sector’s significant share in the US economy. In 2023, the US spent an estimated $4.7 trillion on healthcare, translating to about 18% of the national GDP. This expenditure is nearly double that of other countries with similar economic situations. According to research, the US spends $12,555 per capita on healthcare compared to $7,358 for the Netherlands, $8,049 for Switzerland, and $6,517 for France. The US also has quite a few cities being featured on the list of 30 Cities With the Best Healthcare in the World. However, despite the high levels of spending, there still remains significant room for improvement in the quality of healthcare services in the US. A majority of US consumers may not express immediate concern, given that they are covered by insurance plans provided by their employers. However, this lack of concern is often due to a lack of information for evaluating both the quality and costs of healthcare services. The inefficiency in pricing within the healthcare system, coupled with average treatment outcomes, puts a burden on the national economy.', 'The 2024 outlook for healthcare by Deloitte reveals that healthcare companies are navigating a range of issues and changing trends, such as continued financial stress, the integration of new technologies, and a growing trend of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Furthermore, the rising labor expenses are acting as a significant pressure point for healthcare companies, leading to lowered margins. These increasing costs of medical care and coverage are expected to leave consumers with higher treatment expenses in 2024 and beyond. In 2023 alone, the prices of outpatient care and hospital services recorded an increase of 5.7% and 4.2%, respectively. In response to these financial challenges, many healthcare companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) are optimizing their operations to increase efficiency and cut down costs.', ""Here's what Polen Capital said about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.', 'Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&D and SG&A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”', 'Despite the challenges, the US healthcare industry has numerous top-rated hospitals, and the best hospitals in the US by state offer high-quality treatments. The improvements across the industry are being driven by advancements in segments such as the healthcare service and technology (HST) segment. Projections show that the HST segment is likely to experience the highest growth, maintaining a CAGR of 12% between 2022 to 2027. Meanwhile, the most significant advancements are predicted in software and platforms, along with data and analytics, showing projected CAGRs of 15% and 22%, respectively. Similarly, the pharmacy segment revenue is also predicted to record a CAGR of 5%, reaching a value of $700 billion in 2027. All these factors are also likely to lead to an increase in demand for the services of the top 100 hospitals in the US. With this context in mind, let’s take a look at the cities with the best hospitals in the US.', 'Our Methodology', ""We referred to a number of sources, such as Medbelle, Healthcare Insider, and Newsweek, to shortlist the 30 cities with the best hospitals in the US. The Newsweek database of 600 high-ranking hospitals across the country was scanned to list down all the cities with the best hospitals. The ranking was determined by considering both the total number of the best hospitals in each city and their combined scores. These scores reflect the hospitals' reputation, gathered from the feedback of survey participants and healthcare professionals. The 30 cities with the best hospitals in the US are ranked in ascending order of the total scores."", 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Some of the stocks that were most popular with investors a couple of years ago have now dropped considerably. Worries about the economy, the ongoing state of interest rates, lingering fears of another prolonged bear market, and a shift in investor interest following the worst of the pandemic have been a few catalysts that have driven these changes in investing patterns."", 'While a stock on sale is not a reason in and of itself to buy, some businesses that have been hard hit by shareholder pessimism may actually present a compelling opportunity for the forward-thinking investor. Here are two such stocks to consider for your portfolio as 2024 kicks off.', 'Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) is one of many companies changing the trajectory of how healthcare could look in the years to come. The adoption of telehealth tools and technologies was already well underway before the pandemic, even as the era of stay-at-home orders and overburdened healthcare systems accelerated these trends. Rising demand from both healthcare providers and healthcare consumers is fueling a consistent, growing need for quality telehealth solutions.', ""Teladoc remains one of the companies at the forefront of this revolution, despite its loss of favor with many investors over the last few years. The stock is trading down around 22% over the trailing 12 months but still up about 30% from its 52-week low. Continued unprofitability, moderated growth (compared to the pandemic), and mixed investor attitudes toward growth stocks have all been factors at play in Teladoc's performance."", ""However, Teladoc is still growing on many key fronts, and I'd contend that a few years of choppy water haven't diminished the overall value proposition for the underlying business. The company is still one of the premier telehealth providers in the world and makes most of its money from access fees paid by large entities like insurance companies and employers. It makes a lesser portion from its services that are sold directly to consumers and generate per-visit fees."", 'In the first nine months of 2023, Teladoc brought in revenue of $1.9 billion, a 10% increase from the same period in 2022. That top-line figure was driven by a 10% increase in access-fee revenue and a 7% boost in other revenue. Broken down by market, U.S. revenue totaled $1.7 billion for the nine-month period, up 8% year over year. International revenue totaled $269 million, a 21% increase from the year-ago period.', ""The company also recorded 14 million patient visits conducted through its platform in those three quarters. No one can say when the stock price will turn around, relative to the company's business performance, but as the company inches back toward profitability, its shares will likely follow."", 'Teladoc has been heavily slashing its net losses in recent quarters. Many of them were accounting losses, rather than actual operational ones. It also pulled in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $214 million in the first nine months of 2023.', 'I plan to hold onto this stock. Investors who find the business intriguing might be interested in buying on the dip for its long-term potential in the global telehealth space.', ""Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) is trading down by roughly 37% over the trailing 12 months. For context, that's about 8% above its 52-week low."", ""It's been a bumpy time for shareholders of this former highflier. Its stock received tremendous attention from investors during the height of the pandemic as its game-changing COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and antiviral pill Paxlovid brought in record sales and profits."", ""Now that demand for these products isn't anywhere close to what it was a few years ago, and the impact of that is clear on Pfizer's balance sheet, some investors have lost interest in the stock. Does that mean it's time to give up the ship? In my humble opinion, this seems shortsighted."", ""While it's true that Pfizer isn't probably going to witness the kind of growth it did during the pandemic -- at least for the foreseeable future -- that was a unique window in time when the company answered the call for an unparalleled consumer need and raked in a hefty payday, as a result."", 'Since that time, Pfizer has used the billions of dollars worth of profits its COVID-19 products produced and put them to very good use, fueling aggressive acquisitions as well as product development. It also has a robust existing lineup of blockbuster products, including Eliquis, its Prevnar family of vaccines, and Ibrance.', ""Pfizer's run of acquisitions has strengthened its foothold on key disease areas ranging from oncology to inflammation and immunology to neurology. In 2023, partly thanks to internal efforts and partly due to its acquisitive streak, Pfizer achieved more new product approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration than any other company: seven in total."", 'Of those seven products -- which include an ulcerative colitis drug called Velsipity, a multiple myeloma drug Elrexfio, and an RSV vaccine called Abrysvo -- six are on track to reach blockbuster status in the coming years, given their addressable markets and consumer demand.', ""Pfizer is expecting billions of dollars of decline in COVID-19-related sales and the loss of patent exclusivity on core products in the coming years. However, it's expected that new launches expected in the coming months -- 19 launches or expansions in total over an 18-month period -- will bring annual revenue to anywhere from $70 billion to $84 billion by 2030, not counting any COVID-19 products."", ""That would represent a revenue increase of anywhere from 35% on the low end to 62% on the high end by 2030, compared to Pfizer's pre-pandemic annual revenue in 2019. Those are fairly solid 10-year revenue growth rates for a business at Pfizer's level of maturity. Pfizer could be on the cusp of a new period of growth, and investors could find that worth waiting for now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Teladoc Health right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Teladoc Health, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Teladoc Health wasn't one of them.

And the company is still in the early stages of AIP; there could be much more growth to come from the business in the future.', 'Palantir is also a profitable company now, posting a profit for four straight quarters, and it could only be a matter of time before the stock is added to the S&P 500, which would likely result in even more bullishness.', 'If you want some exposure to AI, Palantir is one of the better tech stocks you can invest in right now.', ""Pfizer was one of the S&P's most beaten-down stocks of 2023, with its share price falling by 44% last year. Today, at $28 per share, Pfizer looks like a cheap buy trading at a multiple of 13 times its estimated future earnings. That's well below the S&P 500 average of 21."", ""There's good reason for investors to be bearish on the stock. Pfizer's future looks uncertain now that COVID revenue isn't propping up its financials. Sales from its COVID vaccine, Comirnaty, plummeted 70% last quarter (also ended Sept. 30, 2023).

In total, Pfizer plans to add $25 billion to its top line by the end of the decade thanks to acquisitions and the development of new products to help offset declines in COVID revenue and other key products.', ""There's some risk with Pfizer's stock, but there's also the potential for this to turn out to be a fantastic contrarian investment for anyone willing to be patient with it."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Shopify wasn't one of them.

Cohen already let the case proceed against Fox News — and on Wednesday, he rejected a request by Fox Corporation to throw out the claims against the parent company.', 'The lawsuit was filed in the wake of the 2020 election, when Fox repeatedly gave airtime to far-right figures who promoted outrageous and debunked claims that Smartmatic rigged the presidential election by flipping millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. They did this even though on-air anchors, top producers and executives privately admitted that the election wasn’t stolen.', 'The judge said Smartmatic’s case was strong enough to proceed against the parent company because it has “sufficiently alleged that (Fox) Corp. employees acted with malice by purposely and deliberating publishing knowingly false stories about (Smartmatic) in order to benefit (Fox) Corp.’s financial interest.”', 'Smartmatic has “sufficiently alleged in their amended complaint that (Fox) Corp. employees played an affirmative role in the publication of the defamation at issue,” Cohen concluded.', 'The parent corporation had argued that it shouldn’t be involved in the defamation case because it only had general oversight of Fox News itself. Further, Fox Corp. argued there wasn’t proof that any corporate employees “directed” the allegedly defamatory statements to be aired.', 'Fox denies defaming anyone and claims that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment.', '“We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the ruling. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.”', 'Smartmatic sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021 for defamation and is seeking more than $2 billion in damages. A New York appeals court previously dismissed the case against Fox Corp. but gave Smartmatic a chance to refile the allegations with more evidence. Cohen said Wednesday that the refiled claims against Fox Corp. are sufficient enough to move forward.', '“We look forward to proceeding and holding Fox Corporation, as well as Fox News, responsible for the damage they did to Smartmatic,” the company’s lead attorney Erik Connolly said.', 'The case is still in the discovery phase, with some major depositions taking place in the past month, including former Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch.', 'The decision boosts Smartmatic’s case against the right-wing media behemoth. A similar 2020-related lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems was also allowed to proceed against Fox and its parent company. That case unearthed tranches of internal emails that described in devastating detail how top Fox officials cravenly allowed Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell to lie about the election on its shows.', 'The judge also on Wednesday gave Fox News a greenlight to continue its counterclaims against Smartmatic. The right-wing network is alleging that Smartmatic’s massive $2.7 billion request for damages is a legally baseless attempt to silence the network’s free-speech rights.', 'Fox filed its counterclaims against Smartmatic last year, in a bid to push back against the company and recover the money it’s spending on high-priced attorneys to defend itself.', '“(Fox’s) argument here is that (Smartmatic’s) alleged damages are so extenuated from their actual lost profits that they were pleaded and/or sought in order to chill (Fox’s) free speech rights. That argument has not yet been adjudicated in any court,” Cohen said, paving the way for Fox to continue its fight against the $2.7 billion figure.', 'Smartmatic had asked Cohen to dismiss the counterclaims, on the basis that of Fox’s arguments were already shut down in Dominion’s similar defamation case that the right-wing network settled last year, and that they shouldn’t be relitigated now.', 'In the Smartmatic case, Fox has previously argued that the Florida-based voting company couldn’t have lost billions of dollars due to the airing of election lies because it was already unprofitable and scandal-plagued before anyone accused the company of rigging votes against Trump.', '“While the recovery of fees and costs will not undo all the damage this First Amendment-defying lawsuit has wrought, at least it may cause the next plaintiff to think twice before trying to penalize the press to the tune of billions of dollars in non-existent damages for ensuring that the people can hear perspectives from all sides of the most pressing controversies of the day,” Fox wrote in a filing last year.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

These people have gone on to create other valuable businesses over the years.', ""But it's safe to say that PayPal has been a disappointment for investors more recently. As of this writing, the stock has declined 74% during the last three years, compared to a 14% gain by the Nasdaq Composite index. That might prompt existing shareholders to dump their stakes, and lead those on the sidelines to avoid even considering the stock."", 'I believe that would be a mistake, because this might be a rare opportunity. Here are three reasons investors should seriously consider buying this well-known fintech stock.', ""Don't let the poor share performance distract you from the fact that PayPal is still a successful enterprise. It currently has 428 million active users, including 35 million merchants. In the third quarter, its annualized total payment volume was an enormous $1.6 trillion."", ""That scale has resulted in an extremely profitable operation, as is the case with other large payments businesses. PayPal's operating margin has averaged 15.9% in the last five years, and if new Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss drives greater efficiencies (as he plans to), then it's reasonable to expect that the company's profitability will improve."", 'As the operator of a two-sided platform connecting individuals and merchants, PayPal benefits from powerful network effects. Consumers want to sign up for its digital wallet because of how widely accepted it is. And the value proposition for merchants to accept PayPal is clear because it helps them attract a global customer base. This somewhat insulates the company from the threat of disruption from its rivals in the industry.', 'Another key competitive advantage has to do with data. Because it collects data from both sides of each transaction, PayPal can better detect fraud and boost authorization rates. This leads to more revenue for merchants.', ""In Q3 2023 -- its most recently reported quarter -- PayPal's revenue increased 8% year over year to $7.4 billion. And management's last forecast for the full year was for sales to rise by about the same percentage. Total payment volume rose 15% in Q3, further showcasing that the company is posting solid growth despite economic uncertainty."", ""There's reason to believe that PayPal should be able to keep registering healthy gains for the foreseeable future. Because the company specializes in online transactions, the increasing penetration of e-commerce provides a powerful tailwind for PayPal."", 'Additionally, the proliferation of electronic payments could propel PayPal. Its services are available in more than 200 countries worldwide, so as cash transactions decline as a share of the economic activities in both developed and emerging economies, PayPal is in a favorable position.', ""Investors can't ignore the negative impacts of higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. PayPal's platform leans more toward discretionary purchases, which is what consumers cut back when times get tough. But given that the economy spends much more time expanding over the long term than it does in recession, PayPal is poised to perform well."", ""Beyond its competitive advantages, strong financials, and growth potential, the most pressing reason to add PayPal to your portfolio now is its bargain valuation. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19. This represents a discount both to the S&P 500's average and PayPal's historical average of 48."", ""Based on the company's positive attributes, it's easy to see that the market's punishment of PayPal stock has gone too far. And this presents investors with a good buying opportunity."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

But that is a bit misleading, because many individual stocks are still struggling. While many stocks related to artificial intelligence and tech have been doing well, this hasn't been a big, broad market rally."", ""However, when the index set a new all-time high on Jan. 19, it signaled we've been in a bull market since the old bear market bottomed in October 2022. And there could be more gains coming, especially if a long-feared recession doesn't weigh down the economy."", ""In a strong bull market, three stocks that could be among the biggest winners include PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Green Thumb Industries (OTC: GTBIF). Here's why."", 'Fintech stock PayPal hasn\'t been doing well in recent years. As more companies have come out with different payment options, including ""buy now, pay later"" services, there\'s been growing concern that PayPal is simply facing too much competition to be a big growth stock anymore. Over the past year, shares of PayPal have declined by 17%.', ""But as recently as 2021, nearly 77% of the top 1,000 retail chains, as determined by Digital Commerce 360, offered PayPal as a payment option. And usage among those retail chains increased that year compared to 2019. Even if PayPal's market share declines, this will still be a top online payments company for years to come."", ""Investors may also be underwhelmed by PayPal's recent results; through the first nine months of 2023, its revenue totaled $21.7 billion and rose by only 8%. But with the global economy still worried about a possible recession, there's a bit of hesitance among consumers. In a bull market, there could be much more optimism and consumer spending, leading to better results for PayPal. "", ""The company's growth days are by no means over. And with the stock trading at a fairly modest 12 times its estimated future earnings, there is a lot of room for PayPal's stock to rally."", ""Realty Income is another stock that hasn't benefited from the S&P's rally; its shares are down 15% over the past 12 months. Still, the real estate investment trust (REIT) has been doing fairly well of late, and there are no serious concerns about its performance or the safety of its dividend, which yields around 5.5%."", 'Through the first nine months of 2023, the REIT reported funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.09, which was better than the $2.99 it posted a year ago. The REIT has a diversified portfolio anchored by some of the biggest names in retail and is one of the safer REITs you can invest in today.', 'With a strong FFO, a key number that REIT investors focus on when evaluating the safety of the dividend, there are no glaring concerns for investors about the business itself. The REIT pays a monthly dividend of $0.2565, which would total approximately $2.31 over a nine-month stretch -- far lower than the $3.09 FFO per share it posted over a similar period; its payout ratio is 75% based on that metric.', 'Concerns about high interest rates are likely a key reason investors remain hesitant to invest in Realty Income and other REITs. But with rates widely expected to start coming down sometime this year, businesses like these could get a boost.\xa0Realty Income is another stock that could thrive under more encouraging economic conditions.', 'Green Thumb Industries is a top cannabis producer, but due to the federal ban on marijuana, this is the riskiest stock on this list. While it has often gotten a boost from excitement around the possibility of marijuana reform and legalization, Green Thumb and other multi-state operators have largely struggled because of the lack of progress on any significant reform. ', ""Although the stock has rallied an impressive 60% over the past 12 months, when looking at Green Thumb's three-year performance, its value is actually down by 58%."", ""The cannabis company has generated more than $1 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months and has been close to breakeven, incurring a loss of $18.2 million during that time frame. It's one of the safer cannabis companies to invest in, given its relatively strong financials, but there will be some inherent volatility with this investment due to the uncertainty around marijuana reform."", 'There is excitement around a possible rescheduling of cannabis, down from a Schedule I substance to a Schedule III. However, that by no means would guarantee or imply that legalization is around the corner.', 'But in a broad bull market, there should be much more excitement around growth stocks in general. And Green Thumb, with its sluggish performance over the past few years, may see a big increase in its share price as it is a leading company within the industry, with a presence in 15 states and 90 retail locations.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -39.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $34.3 billion, down 16.1% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.37% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Phillips 66?', 'For Phillips 66, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Phillips 66 would post earnings of $4.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.63, delivering a surprise of -3.14%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

In the third quarter of 2023, the company’s total costs and expenses of $36.8 billion dropped 9.2% from $40.6 billion a year ago. This trend most likely continued in the October-December period of 2023.On a further bullish note, the improvement in Marathon Petroleum’s Midstream segment results might have buoyed its to-be-reported bottom line. Thanks to higher gathering system throughputs, robust tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from its wide range of midstream energy services, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this unit’s operating income is pegged at $1.2 billion, suggesting an increase of $103 million from the prior-year quarter’s profit.

We took structural and foundational actions to improve our core business and simplify operations, resulting in greater operational focus and a clear path for more transformative Reinvention actions this year and beyond. For the full year, the Company delivered growth in earnings and operating cash flows despite a modest decline in revenue, reflecting the successful implementation of a more flexible cost structure and rigorous operating discipline. Additional structural efficiencies enabled by our Reorganization are expected to drive further profit improvement in 2024.', 'Equipment sales of $458 million in the fourth quarter 2023 declined 17.3% in actual currency, or 18.3% in constant currency1, as compared to the fourth quarter 2022. The prior year effect of backlog2 reduction drove more than a 25-percentage point year-over-year decline. Total equipment revenue outpaced equipment installation activity, due to favorable product mix. Installations of High-End color equipment, which were less affected by prior year backlog2 reductions, increased as compared to fourth quarter 2022, while Entry and Mid offerings declined. Declines in entry primarily reflect prior year reductions to backlog2 and current year constraints. Post-sale revenue of $1.3 billion declined 5.8% in actual currency, or 7.5% in constant currency1, as compared to fourth quarter 2022. The decline was primarily due to lower sales of non-strategic and lower margin paper and IT endpoint device placements, which we plan to reduce over time, as well as the exit of Russia, the termination of the Fuji Royalty and the absence of PARC revenue. Combined, these items contributed 500 basis points to the year over year decline in post-sale revenue.', 'The pre-tax (loss) of $(88) million for the fourth quarter 2023 decreased by $233 million as compared to pre-tax income of $145 million in the fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to lower revenue and gross profit as well as higher Restructuring and related costs, net and Other expenses, net. Adjusted1 operating income decreased $82 million as compared to fourth quarter 2022 due to lower equipment and post sale revenue. Benefits from structural simplification efforts and pricing were partially offset by higher compensation expense and a lack of Fuji royalty income.', 'We expect a total Revenue decline of 3% to 5% in constant currency in 2024, which includes effects of prior year backlog2 reductions and the exit or deemphasis of non-strategic businesses – all of which is unrelated to the performance of our core print and services businesses. Core business revenue is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year, reflecting stable Print demand, growth in Digital and IT Services and neutral macroeconomic conditions.', 'We expect 2024 pre-tax income and adjusted1 operating income margins to improve in 2024 to approximately 5.1% and at least 7.5%, respectively. The increase in profit margins will primarily be driven by structural simplification actions enabled by our reorganization, including the effects of the workforce reduction decisions announced in January 2024.', 'Free cash flow1 is expected to be at least $600 million in 2024 (includes $50 million for capital expenditures). Free cash flow1 is expected to benefit from a reduction in our finance receivables balance. Improvements in cash flow from underlying operations are expected to be offset by restructuring payments, higher cash taxes and an increase in pension contributions.', '___________', '(1)', 'Refer to the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measure.', '(2)', 'Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be installed, including orders with future installation dates.

Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our transformation programs are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance.', 'Amortization of intangible assets: The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.', 'Non-service retirement-related costs: Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. This approach is consistent with the classification of these costs as non-operating in Other expenses, net.

We refer to this adjusted revenue as ""constant currency.""

The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine AES’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' See our latest analysis for AES ', 'According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 39%, trading at US$16.50 compared to our intrinsic value of $11.91. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since AES’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With revenues expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for AES. If the level of expenses is able to be maintained, it looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation."", 'Are you a shareholder? AES’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AES should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AES for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for AES, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for AES you should know about."", 'If you are no longer interested in AES, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

GM, Cemex CX, Centene CNC, Qifu Technology QFIN and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB.', 'Value analysis is the best approach to identifying great bargains. Though price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.', ""The P/B ratio, sometimes called the market-to-book ratio, is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share."", 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Co., Cemex, Centene, Qifu Technology and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Here are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit, General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

So Demchak wants his Pittsburgh-based bank to ""move into that next level"" and be known ""coast to coast as a ubiquitous standard brand.""', '""Scale matters,"" he added. ""We’re going to have to play that game.""', 'Demchak’s comments are stoking a new debate about the path forward for the nation’s biggest regional banks following the turmoil of 2023. Can they still thrive in that pocket between a colossus like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and thousands of tiny community banks, or do they need to consolidate and get much bigger to ensure their long-term survival?', 'Many of these banks are generally on more stable ground than they were during the first half of last year when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered panic about the strength of many other mid-sized financial institutions across the US.', 'Their stocks even surged late in 2023 as investors became more convinced the Federal Reserve was ready to start cutting sky-high interest rates as early as March. Such a move would help mid-sized banks that watched their profits plunge as deposits became more expensive.', 'Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards', 'But it is not yet clear when or if those cuts will happen, and bank stocks have fallen back at the start of 2024 as policymakers push back on market expectations for a loosening in the first quarter.', 'This uncertainty means regional banks will continue to struggle with a key profitability measure known as net interest income — which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay out on their deposits.', 'Income fell at many regional banks during the fourth quarter, and some said they expect it to fall during 2024 as well. That includes PNC, which said it expects net interest income to drop 5% this year.', 'But Demchak’s bigger concern is existential: He said last week that his bank needs to get bigger so it can exist in a category that would give PNC the ""quasi support that the giant banks have"" during times of crisis.', 'This was not the first time Demchak has made this point. He also did so in December while speaking at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in New York. When asked then if he would consider acquiring another bank, he said, ""Scale matters today more than it ever has.""', 'Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo decided to ask Demchak about this topic again last week during PNC’s fourth quarter earnings conference call, and Mayo summed up his reaction to the CEO’s survival-of-the-fittest guidance with one word: ""Wow.""', 'Demchak’s comments served as ""a very clear advertisement"" that PNC is looking to buy other banks over time, Mayo told Yahoo Finance.', '""I see this advertisement to buy targets as more of an announcement for the next three years, not the next three quarters,"" he added.', 'Not all of Demchak’s regional rivals agree with his view. ""I do not think scale is the answer for a bank like Key,"" KeyCorp (KEY) CEO Chris Gorman told analysts last week. Key is a regional bank based in Cleveland.', '""It\'s not something you have to have,"" added M&T Bank (MTB) CFO Daryl Bible. M&T is a Buffalo, N.Y.-based regional lender.', 'PNC has in the past used acquisitions to get bigger during times of industry-wide stress. During the 2008 financial crisis, it was encouraged by the US government to buy Cleveland rival National City for $5.2 billion, which basically doubled its size.', 'Demchak has since used more acquisitions over the last decade to establish a foothold in nearly every top metro area in the country. His last was a $11.6 billion deal for the US operations of Spanish banking giant BBVA that closed in 2021. PNC now has roughly $561 billion in assets.', 'Read more: 5 ways to transfer money from one bank to another', 'The CEO tried last year to get even bigger. PNC was asked by the FDIC to submit a bid to acquire the operations of San Francisco lender First Republic, which would have given it a much larger foothold on the West Coast.', 'But it lost that auction in the early hours of May 1 to JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest and most profitable lender.', 'Demchak, 61 years old, was a late arrival to the world of regional banking. He got his start on Wall Street, working for JPMorgan in the 1990s. While there, he became head of structured finance and was well known for helping develop credit default swaps and selling them to investors.', 'Demchak arrived at PNC, a bank based in the area where he grew up, when he was 40. He served as CFO and head of corporate and institutional banking before becoming CEO in 2013.', 'He has periodically been mentioned or considered as a potential candidate to run much bigger banks before Bank of America (BAC) chose Brian Moynihan as its CEO and Wells Fargo (WFC) appointed its current boss Charlie Scharf. But he has chosen to stay in Pittsburgh.', 'Not all industry observers agree with Demchak’s latest argument that regional banks will drag unless they merge.', '""It\'s a great soundbite,"" said Gerard Cassidy, bank analyst for RBC, but ""that\'s not reality. The reality is that banks have relationships.""', 'Market share — or ""density"" in specific businesses — trumps national scale, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told Yahoo Finance.', 'Scott Siefers, an analyst with Piper Sandler, agreed that ""the whole game seemed to change in 2023,"" and that ""what most people have concluded is that banks are just simply going to have to get bigger to compete.""', 'But there are a lot of hurdles to that consolidation, he said, from high interest rates to the Biden administration’s skeptical view of big mergers.', '""Longer term, I don’t think there’s much dispute that PNC will be active in the consolidation of the industry,"" he added.

The warehouse giant has been winning market share for decades thanks to its no-frills, membership-based selling approach that allows it to offer products at rock-bottom prices. Costco routinely beats rivals such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT) in key growth and customer traffic metrics. Its earnings are among the most stable in the industry, too.', ""Yet Costco isn't an ideal dividend stock for several reasons, including the fact that management prefers to pay dividends in sporadic lump-sum payments rather than through predictably rising annual ones. There's a better dividend option available for fans of passive income, and it's sitting right in Costco's industry."", ""Target (NYSE: TGT) stock looks attractive after being left out of the recent market rally. Shares declined 15% in the past full year compared to Costco's 45% surge and the 22% increase in the S&P 500. That's because the chain has been posting weak growth trends, with comparable-store sales falling 5% in the most recent quarter. Management is predicting that sales will fall at about the same rate for the full 2023 fiscal year. Costco, in contrast, just reported accelerating comps gains for the month of December at 9 %."", ""Target is making steady progress toward a recovery, though. Inventory has been dropping for more than a year and is now more aligned with the weaker demand it has been seeing in consumer discretionary categories like home furnishings. The Q3 sales result met management's forecasts as well. Yet investors will still want to watch customer traffic trends over the next few quarters for confirmation that Target is on the rebound."", ""The news is more clearly positive around earnings. Target's Q3 operating profit margin jumped to over 5% of sales, compared with just 1% a year ago, for example. That's close to its pre-pandemic rate of 6% and is nearly double Costco's comparable figure."", ""Cost cuts have been a huge contributor, putting Target in position to boost profitability even further once its sales trends pick back up again. Costco's margin tends to stay at about 3% of sales, meanwhile, which limits the earnings investors can expect to see even during booming growth periods. That means Target has more flexibility to lift its dividend commitment in the coming years."", ""Target stock offers a much higher dividend yield of 3.2% today compared to Costco's meager 0.6% rate. Income investors will also be impressed with the retailer's long streak of annual raises. Last year's increase marked Target's 52nd consecutive annual raise, putting it among just a handful of retailers in the exclusive club of Dividend Kings. Passive income fans can count on more years of steady growth ahead even as Costco continues to surprise shareholders with its infrequent lump-sum payouts."", ""Sure, Target's short-term growth prospects aren't excellent. But the stock offers a nice balance between rebounding sales potential, strong earnings, and an excellent dividend yield. And the stock's weak performance this past year has made it cheaper compared with Costco and other peers."", ""You can own Target for 0.6 times annual sales compared to Walmart's 0.69 and Costco's P/S ratio of 1.3 times sales. Income investors should consider taking advantage of that discount before Target's growth rebound kicks into higher gear in 2024 and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Target right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Target, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Target wasn't one of them.

And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.', 'Joseph R. Hinrichs', ""All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. As you will hear from our leadership team today, we are very happy with the momentum we carried into the start of the new year. Of course, mother nature gave us a few challenges over the last couple of weeks, but we are proud of the work our ONE CSX team has done to set us up for success this year. Our railroad is performing well, and Mike Cory and the operations team are already bringing new ideas that are helping us run even better, safer and more efficiently. Our customers are happy with the consistent service that our dedicated employees are delivering, and Kevin Boone will discuss how this is translating into profitable business opportunities. Sean Pelkeyl will go over our financial position, which remains very strong as we continue to deliver healthy volumes, favorable pricing, strong operating margins and high levels of free cash flow. Before we talk about the details of the past quarter and our expectations for 2024, it's important to take a step back to appreciate all that our ONE CSX team accomplished in 2023. Everyone on this call knows, it's been a very active period for our entire industry. Recall that it was just over a year ago that Congress took action to prevent a major rail strike. Soon afterwards, highly visible events last winter led to important public debates about railroad safety. And through the year, Class 1 railroads have completed major mergers and made significant leadership changes. Meanwhile, our customers have had to manage through higher interest rates and inflation on the one hand and wars and supply chain disruptions on the other. Through all of this, the aim of our ONE CSX team has been to keep moving forward on our key goal of delivering sustainable, profitable growth that benefits all our key stakeholders. Our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities we live in and serve. For example, CSX was the first Class 1 railroad to reach paid sick leave agreements with our union partners, and we were the first railroad to significantly change our attendance policies based on employee feedback. We were also the first U.S. Class 1 railroad to be released from the additional service metric reporting by the STB back in May based on our improvements in service to our customers. Now here on Slide 5, we have listed several key achievements from this past year that helped us take important steps forward. First and foremost, our focus on safety has driven strong results over the year, especially in the fourth quarter, enabling us to report much improved accident and injury rates compared to 2022. Our service metrics that have consistently led the industry, and today, CSX remains ahead of our peers. Importantly, this is improving our customers' experience, which puts us in a great position to gain their trust and gain share. You've heard me reiterate this all year long. Our team delivered positive volume growth in merchandise that beat U.S. industrial production. Improved efficiency helped us grow coal volumes and our intermodal business gained traction led by our service and market initiatives. Our commercial and operating teams are more closely aligned than ever. Our customers know that when we offer them a solution, we have the commitment and the expertise to deliver it. Finally, we have seen our efforts to renew the culture here at the railroad start to really take shape. Through our site visits, family days and our regular surveys and town halls, we see the increased pride and energy that our employees are feeling through ONE CSX. And this is great progress, and we are proud of what we've accomplished this past year. None of these efforts are done or complete as this is a journey. There is so much more that we can accomplish as we work together as ONE CSX team. On Slide 6, we highlight some of the key results from our fourth quarter. Total volume grew by 1%, reaching 1.56 million units in the quarter. Much of this growth was driven by our strong merchandise franchise, which gained 3% year-over-year. Our total revenue decreased by roughly 1% to $3.68 billion as the effects of higher volumes and favorable pricing were offset by a decrease in other revenue and lower fuel surcharge due to lower diesel prices as compared to last year. We earned $0.45 per share compared to $0.49 per share a year ago. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike Cory to go over the details of our operations."", 'Michael A. Cory', ""Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to Slide 8, and let's just go to the Q4 recap. As I've said many times before, safety is foundational to every success we have. We saw a reduction in engineering and mechanical-related accidents and a reduction in transportation injuries during the quarter. And I really want to thank every CSX employee for their continued efforts on creating a safe working environment for themselves and each other. And that is extremely important. But we know we still have work to do. While the full year numbers showed overall improvement, we were flat on transportation-related accidents and saw an increase in engineering-related accidents. These are all areas of opportunities we aim to improve in 2024 and beyond. Safety at its core isn't solely about incidents. It's about how employees feel working within the organization. When we have an environment where employees feel included, respected, valued and listened to, we can continue to identify areas of improvement as a team and change them. In 2023, we listened to our employees, and we made positive changes to the work environment in response, converting these conversations in sound successful practices. Our results are beginning to demonstrate that this is already making a difference, but we have a ways to go. We'll continue to keep this dialogue open and learn from each other. When done right, the entire ONE CSX team will meet its great potential when it comes to operating safely and efficiently in service to our customers. Moving over to the next slide. And on this slide is pretty self-explanatory. To me, it shows we've stabilized our network and we performed pretty well over the quarter. But one of our key focus areas is on maintaining and bettering our customer-facing metrics. Our fluidity has started to allow us to look deeper at our operating plan, again to better align the hard assets needed to move the volume. The team has been focused on maximizing car connections and maximizing the train load, while at the same time reducing locomotive dwell and active horsepower on the trains. As a result, we've seen both a reduction in active locomotive use and daily train starts. Titan connection standards in our yards are starting to drive changes to our operating plan to result in quicker connections, driving a strong focus on using our locomotive technology to reduce fuel usage on line of road has contributed to a savings in overall fuel cost. Altogether, we're finding tangible opportunities to open up more capacity on this network. We expect these metrics to continue to improve as we go forward. Going over to Slide 10. I really believe we've made good headway in Q4 and especially over 2023, our key metrics continue to improve and our network is fluid. Our head count is at the point that we are now able to manage through efficiency and attrition. We're paying close attention to resource requirements for any new business coming online when needed. Our focus on car connections and train tonnage closely matched the horsepower along with network fluidity allowed us to reduce 2.5% of our daily starts in the quarter and start to store active locomotives. Among other things, this coming quarter, we'll be performing full territory reviews with our team that will further improve our customer service and continue to identify opportunities to better align asset use. And of course, we'll be working right along with Kevin and his sales and marketing team to deliver this great service and grow with our customers. In closing, during my 4 months on the property, I continue to learn more about this network and especially the women and men that make up this tremendous ONE CSX team. I'm extremely excited about our potential to deliver our customers better service with greater safety, efficiency and teamwork. And I'm excited to do this together as one group of great railroaders. So thanks for the time, and over to you, Kevin."", 'Kevin S. Boone', ""Thank you, Mike. It really has been great to see how well our teams have been working together and the positive momentum we are building with our customers as they recognize CSX's focus on service. This teamwork is allowing us to build on new opportunities and drive attractive and profitable growth across all of our end markets. Business conditions in 2023 were challenging for many of our customers with several of our key markets experiencing volatility driven by a number of factors, including inventory destocking. On the positive side, we saw many of these markets show improvement in the fourth quarter which, combined with our industry-leading service, provides optimism that the team can deliver strong revenue growth. Turning to Slide 12, we look at our merchandise performance. As you can see, our revenues were up 5% on both the quarterly and annual basis. Even with the effects of reduced fuel surcharge, volume increased by a solid 3% for the quarter and 2% for the full year, outpacing domestic industrial production that's been effectively flat. And we've delivered pricing results that reflect the higher inflationary backdrop that we have all experienced. Looking at the details of the quarter. Automotive performed well even with the temporary disruption caused by the UAW strike as total volumes held up and we continue to see leverage and we continue to leverage service to gain new business. Chemicals was challenged over most of the year but delivered positive growth in the fourth quarter, driven by shipments in plastics, sand and waste. For fertilizers, strong domestic demand and higher CSX shipments of potash exports supported volumes. Short-haul phosphate shipments remained constrained by its supply issues, which weighs on volumes but provides a tailwind for yields. Metals has continued to be an area where our service provides growth opportunities, and in minerals, infrastructure-related demand continued to be very healthy over the quarter with new cement production supporting volumes. For Forest Products, volume was modestly lower year-over-year but increased sequentially as pulpboard demand has started to show signs of recovery. While the ramp-up in ag and food over the fourth quarter was challenged, with Southeastern feed buyers remaining well supplied from local crops, combined with slower ramp-up in exports. As we head into 2024, we are encouraged with the momentum we've built across the business, and we see many opportunities across the end markets we serve. Our service continues to differentiate CSX in the marketplace, and we are excited about the opportunities this offers us to work with customers to collectively grow our businesses together. Turning to Slide 13. Coal revenue decreased 1% for the fourth quarter as we lapped very strong export pricing from a year ago. Volumes remained positive, growing by 3% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Our coal business continues to be strong with service levels accelerating in the fourth quarter and global export prices supporting U.S. production. At the end of the last quarter, we indicated that export demand remains strong, that lower natural gas prices and reduced restocking demand would likely weigh on domestic shipments, and that's exactly what happened in the fourth quarter, with export tonnage up a full 27% while domestic tonnage declined by 13%. Coal RPU of just over 3,200 per ton was up 5% sequentially, in line with our expectations. For the new year, we are optimistic supported by continued strength in export demand as global benchmarks for both met and thermal currently remain at healthy levels. We also see incremental production growth on our network in West Virginia which will primarily be focused on the export market. Domestic demand in 2023 was supported by months of aggressive restocking at utilities and a very hot summer. With stockpiles at more normal levels, demand upside will largely be dependent on weather conditions in 2024. That said, total electricity demand growth remains substantial, especially in the Southeast, driven by new industrial capacity to data centers to even EV charging stations. Turning to Slide 14. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue decreased 4% on flat volumes. For the full year, revenue decreased 11% on volumes that were down 7%. Lower fuel surcharge drove the largest impact to yields. Our domestic intermodal business continued to perform well, with volume increasing sequentially and growing in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We saw growth with our key partners that continue to experience industry-leading service performance, which was recently highlighted in JOC's customer satisfaction results. Our ability to deliver domestic growth was an extraordinary team effort, especially given the significant challenges facing the trucking market. In International, volumes were lower compared to last year, but we were encouraged to see improvement each month with December actually showing modest year-over-year growth as the positive effects of more normalized retailer inventories gain traction. Our team has continued to work hard to maximize our opportunities, which showed up in the growth as we work to build new partnerships, create new service offerings and leverage higher activity at the inland ports that we serve. Positive market trends are taking shape as we head into 2024, and we expect the combination of a more supportive market, new conversion opportunities and service offerings to drive year-over-year growth in both the domestic and the international business. We continue to monitor the evolving situations at both the Panama Canal and the Red Sea. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any changes in our customer behavior but we stand at the ready with the capacity and capabilities to adapt as needed. Finally, as we turn the page to 2024, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. The team is accelerating our efforts in many areas of our business to work hand-in-hand with our customers to identify areas for growth. From industrial development to identifying market-specific operating metrics that enhance the customer experience, to even working closely with our rail partners to unlock growth. These are just a few of the focus areas for the team. Now I'll hand it over to Sean to read you the financial review."", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter revenue fell by 1% while operating income was down 10% or $139 million. Now these results include $180 million of discrete year-over-year impacts from declines in Other revenue, real estate gains and export coal benchmark prices. However, the underlying results also reflect the benefit of our sustained service levels throughout 2023 and growing momentum in the business. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue, excluding fuel, increased by 5%, benefiting from strong core pricing across the merchandise portfolio and 3% volume growth in both merchandise and coal. Counter to normal seasonal trends, the team delivered sequential volume gains, helping operating income increase by $25 million relative to the third quarter. Interest and other expense was $16 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $23 million, the effective tax rate of 22.9% included $19 million of favorable adjustments primarily for state tax matters relative to $33 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year. Our expected tax rate going forward remains 24.5%. Earnings per share fell by $0.04, including $0.07 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. For the full year, operating income fell by 8% or $462 million, while earnings per share was 5% lower. These results were impacted by the prior year Virginia real estate transaction, declining intermodal storage revenue and lower export coal benchmarks totaling nearly $700 million on a combined basis. The hard work of our ONE CSX team provided our customers reliable and consistent service throughout 2023, and laid a strong foundation for long-term profitable growth. With profitable growth in mind, we will also be making a change in how we report results going forward. Starting in the first quarter of 2024, we will transition to a more conventional approach of reporting operating margins rather than operating ratio. Our goal is to target margin improvement, aligning the business around a balanced approach that includes profitable volume gains and pricing to the value of our service, all while controlling costs and optimizing asset utilization. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expenses. Total fourth quarter expense increased by $89 million as the impacts of lower real estate gains, inflation, increased depreciation and higher head count were partly offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings in PS&O and rents. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe was up $82 million, impacted by inflation and additional headcount. The quarter also included costs that related to the timing of union employee vacation and sick benefits. We expect this to adjust down resulting in a lower sequential cost per employee in the first quarter. Purchased services and other expense increased $4 million versus last year, as inflation was mostly offset by savings from our intermodal and engineering teams. We expect a modest sequential increase in the first quarter, similar to what we have seen in recent years. As a reminder, we'll cycle a prior year insurance recovery of nearly $50 million in the first quarter. And while we expect increased technology carry costs and a need for more locomotive overhauls to impact expense in 2024, we are actively implementing cost savings and efficiency initiatives that will help offset these headwinds. Depreciation was up $24 million, including an $11 million adjustment related to prior periods. We are projecting roughly $40 million to $50 million higher full year depreciation expense in 2024. Fuel cost was down $59 million driven by a lower gallon price. While fuel efficiency was stable year-over-year, we saw strong sequential improvement. These results are especially encouraging as we typically face seasonal efficiency headwinds in the fourth quarter. Mike and the team expect to continue the momentum in this critical measure into 2024 and drive meaningful year-over-year savings. Equipment and rents was $9 million favorable, driven by faster car cycle times across all markets. Finally, property gains were $47 million unfavorable in the quarter. At this time, we do not expect any individually significant transactions during 2024. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 18.Full year free cash flow remains strong at $3.3 billion. Our first priority use of cash remains investing for the safety, reliability and growth of our business. As such, this figure includes $2.3 billion of capital spend across a wide range of projects to ensure the integrity of our network infrastructure as well as the high return strategic investment opportunities. Looking to 2024, note that free cash flow will be impacted by about $380 million of Federal Cash Tax Payments that were deferred from 2023. Cash flow generation also supported close to $4.4 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including $3.5 billion in share repurchases and nearly $900 million of dividends. While economic profit finished lower for the year largely due to lower intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing, our goal is to increase economic profit over time which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks."", 'Joseph R. Hinrichs', ""All right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will conclude with our initial thoughts on our expectations for the full year 2024. As of today, and based on our visibility with our customers and our expectations for the CSX specific initiatives that we are putting in place, we anticipate growth in total volume and total revenue in the low to mid-single-digit range. We see encouraging momentum across our merchandise business, but we are benefiting from service-led gains in market share and wallet share and new industrial development activity. We expect growth in our intermodal business as a prolonged destocking cycle finally winds down and our strategic initiatives continue to drive volume, and export coal demand continues to be very strong with CSX gaining from the ramp-up of a new mine on our network. By growing volumes and utilizing our existing capacity, we expect our profitability to benefit from a favorable combination of solid pricing, better operational efficiency, and a moderate easing in cost inflation. Kevin's team continues to do a great job making sure that we are getting paid for the service we provide. And as Mike discussed, we see all kinds of new opportunities run this network better, safer, faster and more efficiently. We expect an increase in our capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion this year as we invest in safety infrastructure, locomotive rebuilds, upgrades to our portion of the New Alabama Interchange with CBKC and other specific high-return investments, including technology investments. Finally, as before, there is no change to our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns, using our excess cash to fund share repurchases and dividends to benefit our shareholders. In closing, I am very proud of what our entire team accomplished this past year. To our ONE CSX team, I want to thank all of you across all of our facilities in every state and province that we're operating in, through your hard work and for demonstrating that our ONE CSX culture can be something real and impactful. We're in a great position as we head into 2024. And with your help, we can make it even better year than the strong one we just had. For everyone on this call, thank you for all your interest in and support of CSX. Matthew, we're now ready to take questions."", 'Matthew Korn', ""Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Krista, we're ready to start the process."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI.', 'Jonathan B. Chappell', 'Sean, I wanted to dig a little deeper on this part of the guide and maybe some of the delayed productivity improvements that you spoke about. If the volume commentary is low to mid-single digit, you have some of the productivity levers that you were hoping to pull even though you have some of these, I guess, other fixed cost increases in the form of D&A, et cetera. How do you think about margin expansion in 2024 based on your base case of volume and revenue?', 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Thanks, Jonathan. That's a bit of a loaded question, a lot in there. Well, I'll do my best. I think when I step back, our target is to always expand margins, and we can do that by growing the business profitably, operating safely and running an efficient railroad. When I think about 2024 and sort of how that year progresses, we built some momentum coming from Q3 into Q4. We grew volumes. We grew operating income. That's not always the case. Our hope is to continue that momentum going into the first quarter, whether or not withstanding here. And then build that momentum into the second quarter as well. We've got some headwinds year-over-year that we can talk about in the first quarter. They began to ease in the second quarter. And then by the time we get to the second half of the year, the comps are a little bit easier, and that's where I think you'll really see some very strong incremental margins."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna.', 'Bascome Majors', ""Joe, you opened the call talking about a lot of the progress you had made in your first year leading the business. Can you talk about how your focus or at least investors will see your focus involved over the next 12 to 18 months following the success you've had improving a lot of stakeholder relationships in your first 16?"", 'Joseph R. Hinrichs', ""Yes. Thanks, Bascome. I think you heard a little bit of that in -- on the commentary from the team here. We now see our business has stabilized. We've reached a threshold on customer service that has been recognized in the industry, and now you're seeing the opportunity for us to take advantage of that stability to get more efficient. We're now at the manpower levels that we were targeting. There's always going to be some needs here or there. But generally speaking, we're at the manpower levels we were targeting. So we head into 2024 with an opportunity to be in a much more stable setting, the momentum we're building on culture and how people are working together. Mike coming in and his perspective and working closely with Kevin and his team, I feel really good about. The opportunity going forward now is for us to leverage the strength we have in our operating model and the people we have to get more efficient. Obviously, we want to see more safety improvement this year as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and building momentum there. And then take advantage of the opportunity to grow with our customers. We now have over a year of providing stable, persistent, reliable service that our customers are recognizing us for and we have the opportunity now to talk to each one of them about, okay, what can we do together to grow and how can we work together? The journey on efficiency, safety, culture never ends, and we're going to keep working together. But I will tell you, we come into 2024, our network was in good shape, very good shape. Our manpower levels are in good shape. The team is working better together than I've seen it in the time I've been here. And so that gives us confidence that we can build on the momentum we've established over the last year."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan.', 'Brian Patrick Ossenbeck', ""Maybe just a quick follow-up for Sean first. Can you just give us the commentary about the comp per employee stepping down into the first quarter after the increase in 4Q? And then maybe for Mike, can you just give us a sense in terms of what you're seeing? I know it's still little bit early, but a little bit further down the path over the last call, it sounds like fuel efficiency is an area for some big improvement that you're targeting. Maybe some more network in taking out some of the locomotives as the fluidity continues to improve. So what are you seeing there and maybe some rough order of magnitude would be helpful."", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Sure, Brian. I'll begin on the comp per employees. So we did have some true-ups in terms of vacation and sick leave that I mentioned in the quarter. That was probably about $15 million. We also had work that moved from capital into OE. We typically have that in the fourth quarter. So those will both be tailwinds going into the first quarter on comp per employee. So I would expect if you're modeling that a couple of percentage point improvement versus what we reported in Q4. Should be pretty steady in the first half. And then again, we have that 4% wage increase scheduled in July, so probably step up a little bit in the second half of the year. Notwithstanding the efficiency initiatives that Mike and the team are focused on."", 'Michael A. Cory', ""Look, overall asset use, whether it's locomotives, trains we run, how productive all of us are, they're front and center for what we look at. And so for me, it's really, I'd say out of a scale out 1 to 10, I'm about a 4 in terms of where I am in understanding our network and understanding our people. However, we're really starting to focus in on the things that aren't working right. They aren't working against what we think we can do with the franchise, with the network we have. So whether it's size of trains, the state of the train, the use of the technology we have to get the most out of the locomotive. It's just -- right now, it's blocking and tackling, and it's everybody coming together. So we're learning, we're teaching, we're sharing best practices. We're doing the things that, in that fourth quarter was really the last couple of months that we really started to see the things we could do because, first of all, we had the head count. We had the reliability and the fluidity of the network. And so we're just going to keep grinding that stone. But as I said in my remarks, we're going to really get deep into the operating plans over every corridor over the next few quarters. And I'll leave that charge, but I tell you what, I've got a lot of people that are out there ready to go and they're very qualified to do this. So I see, to Sean's point, we got further efficiency ahead of us, but never at the expense of safety and never at the expense of customer service. So our hope is that we continue to provide this great product and the customers are going to come. And that's how we'll also get the efficiency that we need."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens.', 'Justin Trennon Long', 'So with the 2024 guidance being the same for volumes and revenue, low to mid-single-digit growth, is it right to think that your assumption for revenue per unit all-in is flattish? And either way, I was wondering if you could provide some more color on your expectations for coal RPU maybe for the first quarter and then the full year as well?', 'Kevin S. Boone', ""Justin, this is Kevin. I think you hit on it right there on the coal RPU. Obviously, very healthy market right now, how much you embed that going forward. We're optimistic, but we know this market can move around quite a bit. And so maybe a little bit of conservative outlook as we move through the year. Hopefully, there's some upside to that, but that's largely impacting it, as you mentioned, from an RPU perspective. The other thing that I would highlight is we do expect the intermodal market to bounce back here, and that's a lower RPU business as well, but that will be contributory to our growth this year from a volume and revenue perspective.So lower ARPU overall. So that will mix it down a bit. But those are the two large factors that you just highlighted and you know about."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', ""So I want to just dig into the cost side a little bit. So if I just look, I understand some noise with vacations and paid sick but cost x fuel up about 3% to 4% from Q3 with volume up less than 1%. So it's just, we've seen a lot of cost creep that continued in Q4. I guess, ultimately, I'm trying to figure out where do we go from here? Can we start to see overall cost levels stabilize? Do they still increase, but increase just at a slower pace? Is there any chance they could start to come down a little bit? I don't know. I'm just struggling with how to think about the cost side. So any help there?"", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Yes. Thanks, Scott. I can take a stab at it here. So I think fourth quarter, let's remember, we've got the dynamic of some work moving off of capital and going to OE. That's normal. We'll typically see a little bit of a step-up that reverses back in Q1. We probably had, call it, $30 million, $35 million of costs in the quarter that were somewhat unusual items that we mentioned but just as a reminder, we had a true-up on vacation and sick leave, that was about $15 million, as I just mentioned. We had another $10 million on depreciation true-up at the end of the year there for that, that's not going to recur.And then the Livingston, Kentucky derailment was about $10 million as well. So you kind of add all that together, those costs roll off as we go into the first quarter. And then we built some momentum. I mean, as Mike said, he's already looked at the train plan. He's reduced some starts driving tonnage up. That's going to drive fuel efficiency as well, taking some locomotives out. We're not paying maintenance on those locomotives. So we're certainly building some momentum. I think that's going to gradually add in as we go through the year. And that's why I feel really good about where the incrementals are going to be second half of the year."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS.', 'Thomas Richard Wadewitz', ""Wanted to ask, I think it's probably for Kevin, just a little bit on the revenue side. You've had a pretty meaningful storage revenue headwind in 2023. And I think you feel surcharge can be an impact, too. How do you think about those 2 factors as you go in '24? Are they kind of neutral? Or is there still some lingering headwind? And then in terms of price, what kind of a price assumption do you have? Are you thinking stable pricing versus what we got in '23? Or is it kind of up or down?"", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Yes. So just on the first part of the question, Tom, I'll answer that. On the other revenue piece, we're -- I would go ahead and model something like $130 million a quarter, which is kind of what we've been running at the second half of this year. Obviously, you do the math on that, it will be a big headwind in Q1 about, call it, $50 million plus. That's why the comps are tougher in Q1 and then a little less in Q2 before we get to the normalized rate. And then on fuel, don't forget, we had a pretty favorable lag impact in the first half of last year to the tune of almost $70 million across the first and second quarter.So prices have come down a little bit. We are expecting somewhat favorable lag in Q1 of this year, but it'd still be a year-over-year headwind. So those are 2 reasons why we're thinking about more sequential momentum in the first quarter as opposed to being able to deliver growth until we get to the second half of the year."", 'Kevin S. Boone', ""Yes. And then on pricing, I think, as we talked about all last year, we had to react to a much higher inflation environment that we all experienced, quite frankly. And you'll see a lot of that carryover, right? These contracts are negotiated some on a multiyear period, some year-over-year. We know to negotiate every year. So it's fair to say our expectation coming into '24 is cost inflation for our business will be a little bit lower. So I would expect that number to come down when we have our conversations but still very healthy when you look at historical rates, what we were able to achieve. And obviously, that's an important part of our revenue growth story is both volume, a balanced approach between volume and price."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.', 'Brandon Robert Oglenski', ""Mike, I wonder if you could speak more specifically to labor efficiency this year, especially in reference to Kevin's remarks that you're going to have new merchandise business bringing on about 1 point of volume additionally. So how are you planning for headcount? And what are the opportunities for efficiency there?"", 'Michael A. Cory', ""Brandon, I hope you're well. Look, I'm not going to say at this stage that we can add incremental volume without headcount. It depends on what it is and where it's at. But I'm very comfortable with the results we had in Q4 of a run rate of more train size. And that obviously reduces the impact on the headcount. We've got areas that we just haven't got to in my time yet. And I think the -- and this isn't just about trade and size, but we really -- we have a very customer-intensive network. And so we have a lot of yards and locals that, first of all, we're looking to button down and make the service reliable. And with the head count we have right now, we see that we're able to do it.So that leads us to know that we can do better. And so I see the opportunities really in the touches of the cars that we do today. So I see further incremental improvement. I see the ability with the capacity we're creating with the locomotives that we've got added to the storage count to the capacity we created online by having less movements. I see us being able to handle incremental volume with what we have in many cases. But again, there are those key areas we want to make sure that we have the right head count for."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America.', 'Kenneth Scott Hoexter', 'So just, I guess, thinking about the performance there, either Mike or Joe, it looked like your on-time origination is down at 71%, on-time arrivals at 69%. What is still missing from the operations to get that efficiency improving? Have you changed the categories at all to see those sliding since the beginning of the year? Maybe just what are your thoughts on how that gets increased efficiency to get those additional operating leverage savings?', 'Michael A. Cory', ""Thanks, Ken. It just goes back to what I'm talking about in our yards and our terminal performance, and that's where our focus will be. Again, I've been getting the folks to really focus on connecting cars, increasing train size. So we're going through some growth periods in that sense. And yes, it's affecting the on-time performance. But at the end of the day, we're counting on making sure we fulfill the trip plan of the customer, and in some cases, it's going to change the way we design our network and the time the trains go. So I'm not concerned about that at this stage. It certainly isn't anything to do with congestion or poor performance. These are the growing -- the growth -- what would I call, growth observations of a network that's starting to change and really look to more maximize the assets that we have out there to create capacity.So it's not a cause of concern at this moment. Trust me, we look at it in a lot, measured at the minute. So this isn't -- it's not like we've got trains that are late, late, late. These are fractions of hours. And so that's fine. We know we have to operate on time. But at the end of the day, it's the delivery to the customer. It's their first mile, last miles. It's their pain points that we're focused on. And at the same time, we're driving efficiency through running a more condensed network."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi.', 'Christian F. Wetherbee', 'Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the resources question. I guess, as you think about the portfolio of the business opportunities ahead of you that informs the volume growth outlook, can that be done? Or what are the resources required, I guess, as you think about the plans? When we think about headcount, maybe specifically, but maybe also locomotives, what is the growth associated with that, that you guys have in the plan for 2024?', 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Yes. I mean, Chris, one thing to just think about is we added head count through the year in 2023, right? So if we just held everything flat to where we ended the year last year, would be up 2% year-over-year with a little bit more of that year-over-year growth in the first half than in the second half. I think our view right now is that, by and large, with a couple of exceptions, we should be able to hold head count flat and absorb the new growth that's coming on in the network. And so we'll be able to do that. First quarter, it won't look like tremendous employee efficiency just because we added through the year last year, we get into the second half of the year. I think that's where you're going to see the labor productivity show up."", 'Michael A. Cory', ""Yes. And just on top of that, too, Chris. Staying with locomotives, where we still have opportunity to use the locomotives we have out there working, use them harder. And so that's a big focus for us, whether it's dwell, whether it's connection, whether it's what they're pulling, I believe we have the capacity to grow just off of what we have out there right now."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank.', 'Amit Singh Mehrotra', ""Sean, can you just help us, I guess, calibrate 1Q expectations in terms of operating ratio? You talked about $30 million to $35 million of kind of one-timers in the fourth quarter. I think that's like 1 point of OR. Volume is down, I guess, a little over 6%. So that's obviously a headwind. Weather is tough. So just talk about that. And then on the cost side, PS&O costs, there's a lot of focus on labor. Again, it's your biggest cost bucket, but PS&O is a pretty large bucket. And if I look over the last 3 to 4 years, the rate of inflation in PS&O costs are like more than double revenue growth. So what's going on there? What's the opportunity to kind of hold the line or bring that down? Because if I remember correctly, back in '17, '18, that was really a great place to look for efficiency and opportunity. I just want to know if there's an opportunity there in '24 as well."", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Amit, on your Q1 margin question, I think I'll just sort of stick to what I said before in terms of building momentum from Q4 to Q1. That's our goal. It's to deliver, if we can, operating income growth sequentially from Q4 to Q1. The margins will be what they are based on what, where fuel prices settle. But can we grow margins as well in Q1. Sure. I think that's within the realm of possibility. Again, whether or notwithstanding, we had a rough couple of weeks. We're coming out of that, things are certainly looking better across the network as we speak. So you'll see the weekly volumes and see how that catches up from there. In terms of your comment on PS&O, I think it's a good reminder for everybody to go back and understand we added quality carriers a couple of years ago, a significant portion of the expenses within quality shows up in the PS&O line.And that is quite volume variable. And so as we see increases or decreases in the trucking revenue line, that's going to impact PS&O expense as well. We also added PanAm. There are PS&O expenses associated with the revenue that we added across that part of the network as well. And then PS&O can also be somewhat volume driven, particularly on the intermodal side, the terminal related expenses show up there on that line. So what I said was going from Q4 to Q1 on PS&O like we normally do, we would expect a little bit of a sequential increase in those costs and have no doubt, we are certainly focused on that line item amongst others as an area of opportunity to continue to drive cost savings."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo.', 'Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic', ""I just want to go back to the commentary on domestic intermodal specifically around truck conversion. It does seem like we're still really early stages. I would love to get your perspective on what can drive that acceleration in some of those conversions? Is it your reliability improving further? Is it better truck capacity? Just anything, any comments there on what could drive that acceleration of the space at this point?"", 'Kevin S. Boone', ""Yes. I would think -- I've heard many characterize last year as maybe the worst trucking market they've seen in the last 40 years. So I think there's a lot of hope that we're at the bottom or have reached the bottom. I will say, and we've been recognized and I highlighted this in the opening comments, the customers are seeing the service levels that we're delivering. And I know Mike has plans to even improve some of our true terminal fluidity even further. We're looking at ways where we're going to measure the customer experience in a different way. Measure their truck on time terminal and all those things that really are important for those customers that drive value for their customers, quite frankly.So a lot of those initiatives are underway, and that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward through the year that not only hopefully the market has bottomed, but on top of that, that we're going to be able to gain share with the service product that we're able to deliver."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein.', 'David Scott Vernon', ""So Sean, I think you called out, I think it was like $280 million or $380 million of deferred tax headwinds and $300 million of extra CapEx. I just want to confirm I got that $600 million headwind to cash flow rate for the year. And then as we think about timing, Sean, you were very clear about incrementals being better in the back half than the front half. Kevin, can you share anything on the rate at which you'd expect this single -- low to mid-single-digit sort of volume and revenue to show up? Is that also back-end loaded? Or how do we think about the cadence for the year?"", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Yes, David, I'll start. So on your question there, Yes. So deferred tax, $380 million, which was essentially a benefit to 2023. We will make that payment in the first half of 2024. And then on the CapEx, basically going from 2.3 to 2.5. So that's about a $200 million increase on that side."", 'Kevin S. Boone', ""Yes. In terms of the cadence from a volume and revenue perspective, I think we've been clear in that first quarter, some coal dynamics, other things from a pricing perspective or probably the high watermark that we'll have to lap, but pretty even cadence through the year after that. You'll probably remember, we started to see some weakness into the second quarter on the industrial side of our business. And when you think about chemicals and our forest products business, in particular, some very strong, weakness that started to occur that we were -- that we'll begin the lap quite frankly, as we get into the second quarter, late second quarter and third and fourth. So -- but when we look across the year, we think we're able to achieve growth throughout the year."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.', 'Ravi Shanker', ""Maybe just a follow-up on that. Kind of just on the operating leverage itself, I mean in theory, shouldn't we be seeing kind of the bulk of the operating leverage kind of show up now as we come off the floor of volumes and kind of you have the maximum fixed cost absorption? And kind of the follow-up question to that is, if the market stays softer for longer in 2024 and truck rates continue to be competitive, do you think the volumes that you guys are converting will be enough to drive that operating leverage? Or do you also need price to come on top of that?"", 'Sean R. Pelkey', ""Yes, Ravi. So on the operating leverage point, I would say that the leverage is there underlying the business, right? We've had some discrete headwinds that I mentioned in the script. And as we go into the first half of this year, Q1, you got fuel lag from last year, you have other revenue coming down. You've got an insurance recovery. Those are things that we're going to have to lap and get behind us and then a little bit of a tail into Q2 as well, which is why in the second half, on a reported basis, you'll see it show up a lot more cleanly.In terms of the macro, I think, yes, we feel pretty confident about our ability to grow even in the face of a macro that's relatively flat. We have some business wins that are carryover, got some new business that's coming online, and we should be able to absorb most of that with the existing resources, if not tighten up the plan a little bit and save some costs."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Walter Noel Spracklin', ""So I wanted to go back to the coal forecast. I know you mentioned in your remarks here that domestic coal is expected to be modestly impacted. And when we're comparing it to other sources, EIA, you're saying U.S. production is going to be down 16% in 2024, and that's on the back of solar and the retirement of coal-fired capacity. Is this just a different market? Like is the retirement of coal-fired capacity just not in your catchment area? Is it -- what would lead to such a disparity between that kind of forecast and the one that you're providing here on the domestic coal front?"", 'Kevin S. Boone', ""Yes, Walter, we all read your notes here. Obviously, we've been intimately looking at that, and we have our own sources. But we do a bottoms-up build up, right? We look at -- we talk to our customers. We understand what the demand they're seeing in their business, how they're forecasting, what they're telling their investors and their stakeholders in terms of what they're seeing. And quite frankly, this market right now is still a production -- production is going to either decide our upside or limit our upside. It's not -- we don't see a demand right now where it is impacting our volumes next year.It's really a production-constrained market from everything that we're seeing. We see some weakness in the domestic market. We think there is an export market that can continue to push some of that volume into that market. So there is optimism. Obviously, I know this market can change quite quickly. The global environment changes quickly. But for what we see right now and what our customers are telling us, and there will be some weather impact as we get into the year. We'll look at the summer to see if it's hotter than usual or where that shakes out, that will obviously impact our domestic business. But we do think there's an export business that has an outlet for some of the domestic side if we saw some further weakness there."", 'Operator', ""We have no further questions in our queue. And with that, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.""]"

V may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Visa is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for V in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.35 per share for V, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.33 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for V, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.71% heading into earnings season.', 'Visa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc.

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce your conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, you may begin."", 'Craig A. Lampo', ""Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and welcome you to our fourth quarter of '23 Conference Call.Our fourth quarter and full year '23 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3,327 million and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82. Fourth quarter sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and down 1% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year of '23, sales were $12,555 million down 50 basis points in U.S. dollars, flat in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2022.Orders in the quarter were $3,164 million, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95:1. For the full year, orders were $12,267 million, down 5% compared to 2022, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin was $690 million and 20.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of '23 which increased 10 basis points compared to both the fourth quarter of '22 and the third quarter of '23.Adjusted operating income was $706 million, which excluded $16 million in acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating margin was 21.2% during the fourth quarter and a new quarterly record for the company. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '22, and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on slightly higher sales levels as well as the benefit of pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, most of which are currently operating below the corporate average.For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating income was $2,560 million, which included $35 million of acquisition-related costs and excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $2,594 million. For the full year of '23, GAAP operating margin was 20.4% and adjusted operating margin was a strong 20.7%, consistent with our previous annual record margins achieved in 2022 and 2018. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased 10 basis points compared to 2022. Compared to 2022, adjusted operating margin was flat, which primarily was driven by strong operational performance as well as the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was an impressive margin performance given the slight sales decline we experienced in 2023.Our team continued to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down fourth quarter results by segment relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $900 million an increase by 13% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1,345 million and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 23.1%.Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1,082 million and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.5%. Breaking down full year results by segment relative to 2022. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $3,531 million, an increase by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $4,913 million and declined by 13% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 21.6%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems Segment were $4,111 million, an increase by 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.3%.The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 19.2% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. And for the full year of '23, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 22.3% and 24.5% in 2022, respectively. In 2024, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.83 in the fourth quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased to 5% to a record $0.82 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of '22. This was an excellent result.For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $3.11, a 2% increase from $3.06 in 2022. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.01 in 2023, an increase from $3 in 2022. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $842 million or 162% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $739 million or 142% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver such a strong cash flow yield in the quarter and for the full year. In the full year, 2023 operating cash flow was a record $2,529 million or 130% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2023 was a record $2,160 million or 111% of adjusted net income, a very strong result.From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 70 and 55 days, respectively, all within our normal levels. And during the quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86 bringing total repurchases during 2023 to 7.2 million shares or $585 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2023 was $1,086 million.Total debt on December 31 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.7 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 EBITDA was $830 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, our net leverage was 0.9x. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure.I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends."", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. And I hope it's not too late to wish all of you a Happy New Year here from Wallingford, Connecticut. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter and also for the full year of 2023. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and then, of course, we'll have time for questions.Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies, reaching $3,327 million. On an organic basis, our sales did decline by just 1%, with growth in commercial air, defense, automotive and IT datacom markets offset by declines across our other end markets. The company booked $3,164 million in orders in the fourth quarter. This was a 10% growth versus prior year and flat to last quarter, but did represent a book-to-bill of 0.95:1.We're very pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 21.2% in the quarter, a clear reflection of our team's outstanding execution and these margins increased 30 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.82 in the quarter, representing a growth of 5% from prior year. I have to say that we were especially pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $842 million and $739 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter, both just really clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings.I come out of the fourth quarter, extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased that we announced this morning that we closed 4 acquisitions in the quarter, really in November and December. Based in Ohio, TPC Wire & Cable is a value-added provider of harsh environment, cable and cable assemblies for applications across the industrial market and this includes particularly factory automation and heavy equipment and TPC has annual sales of roughly $110 million.Headquartered in New Hampshire and with annual sales of approximately $90 million, Airmar is a leading provider of sensors for the recreational marine, commercial fishing and industrial markets. LID technologies based in Toulouse, France, has annual sales of approximately $40 million. And LID is a high-technology supplier of sensor products to the industrial and automotive markets with a focus on tire pressure monitoring and the telematics associated with that. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of PCTEL, a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, including in particularly the Internet of Things or industrial IoT market. PCTEL generated in 2023, approximately $85 million in sales.As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our acquisition program was very successful in 2023 and our pipeline of prospective deals remain strong as we enter the New Year. Indeed, we continue to see interesting near-term potential opportunities to bring outstanding and complementary organizations into the Amphenol family. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes.Now turning to the full year of 2023, despite the demand challenges that we did experience in certain end markets in the year, I have to say that the Amphenol team delivered another successful year of performance. Amidst significant organic declines in the communications end markets due to inventory builds in 2022 as well as the more recent moderations in demand in the industrial market, our team was able to deliver overall sales that were only slightly down from prior year. This was a testament to the breadth and diversification of the company as well as our team's ability to capitalize in real time on opportunities for incremental sales across the entirety of our markets.Our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 20.7% was flat with our last year record levels in 2022 despite the organic sales decline. This excellent performance by our team allowed us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $3.01 which was just slightly above prior year levels. We also generated record operating and free cash flow of $2,529 million and $2,160 million, respectively, both confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program, which I just discussed really created a great value throughout the year with 10 new companies contributing annualized sales of more than $600 million joining Amphenol in 2023.These new acquisitions enhanced our position across a broad array of technologies while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're excited that these companies represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance and have deepened our already strong bench of leaders around the world. In addition, in 2023, we bought back over 7 million shares under our share buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, and that represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.1 billion. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility across the overall market environment in 2023, as we enter 2024, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance.Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad with no end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2023. This market diversity helps to insulate us from the effect of any given markets volatility while also exposing us to the exciting revolutions happening across the electronics industry.Turning first to the defense market. Our sales represented 12% of our total in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year 2023. Fourth quarter sales once again grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. On an organic basis, sales in the defense market increased by 15%, with broad-based growth across virtually all defense applications, particularly strong in naval helicopters communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 4% from the third quarter.For the full year of 2023, sales in the defense market grew by 20% in U.S. dollars and local currency and by 18% organically. This reflected our operational execution as well as broad strength across most segments of the defense market, and that particularly related to naval, aircraft engine, helicopter, communications and space-related applications.Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially, and we remain very encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We are well positioned to accelerate our new product development and increase our capacity to support this demand long into the future.The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 1% from the third quarter, which was actually ahead of our expectations for a modest seasonal decline. For the full year of 2023, sales increased by a very robust 36% in U.S. dollar, local currency and organically, reflecting our strong design-in positions on a broad range of platforms as well as broad-based demand across all aircraft applications.Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these lofty fourth quarter levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of those growth initiatives for many years to come.The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and 25% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the fourth quarter did decline by 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currencies and 12% organically as growth that we realized in oil and gas, rail mass transit and marine applications, was more than offset by moderations in demand in other segments, including battery and electric heavy vehicles, building automation, transportation and heavy equipment. In addition, our sales into the industrial distribution channel continued to be more muted than they were a year ago.On a sequential basis, sales grew by 1%, but that was driven primarily by acquisitions that we did close in the quarter.For the full year 2023, sales were flat in U.S. dollars and local currency and declined by 7% organically as the contribution from acquisitions was offset by weakness in instrumentation, battery and electric heavy vehicles, factory automation and heavy equipment applications in particular. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these levels as the benefit of recent acquisitions offset the modest organic sequential decline. Despite this near-term demand pause driven in particular by elevated inventory levels, both in the distribution channel as well as in certain end markets, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market.We are very excited by the additions of TPC, Airmar, LID and PCTEL, each of which adds complementary new interconnect sensor and antenna technologies to our industrial product offering. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and 23% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a robust 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency, and on an organic basis, our sales to the automotive market increased by 12%. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 8%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter.For the full year 2023, I'm pleased that our sales increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 12% organically, and that reflected broad strength across the automotive market, including, in particular, next-generation electronics, for example, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2024, we expect a high single-digit sequential seasonal moderation in sales in the first quarter from these levels.I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance in 2023 is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. It's really a multitude of applications, including electrified drivetrains, but not just that, many other applications. We look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come.The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and 10% of our sales for the full year 2023. Our fourth quarter sales moderated by 3% in U.S. dollars, local currency and organic as robust growth in smartphones was once again more than offset by declining sales into tablets, laptops and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9% which was much better than our expectation coming into the quarter for a high single-digit decline. For the full year of 2023, sales in the mobile devices market declined by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declines in other mobile device applications.Looking into the first quarter, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain 1 of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term.The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market declined from prior year by 26% in U.S. dollars, 27% in local currency and 34% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 6%, which was in line with our expectations. For the full year, sales declined by 26% from prior year and 32% organically driven by the spending reductions that we've discussed throughout the year.Looking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales from these fourth quarter levels. And despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year.We're very pleased that our sales in the fourth quarter returned to growth compared to prior year, with sales in U.S. dollars and local currency increasing by 6% and organically by 5%. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much better-than-expected 6%. As we continue to benefit from our strong presence with AI data center customers as well as some overall improved demand.For the full year 2023, our sales in the IT datacom market declined 13% in U.S. dollars and organically as strong demand for AI-related applications was more than offset by inventory adjustments that we saw amongst our traditional IT datacom applications.Looking ahead, we do expect in the first quarter a mid-single-digit sequential seasonal decline in sales. I have to say coming out of what was a challenging year in the overall IT datacom market that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this space. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling artificial intelligence.Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we are very well positioned for the future. This creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.The broadband communication market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down 31% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by 12%, which was worse than our expectations coming into the quarter when we anticipated more of a modest increase. For the full year of 2023, sales were down by 7% in U.S. dollars and organically driven by the continued pause in broadband operator spending. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels.Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.And finally, turning to our outlook. There's no doubt that the current economic environment remains somewhat uncertain. Assuming the continuation of these current market conditions and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3,040 million to $3.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% to 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023.I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.And finally, I just want to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world, including all of those who work across our factories, touch our products, and ultimately deliver to our customers what they need. I'm just truly grateful for all of their outstanding efforts both here in the fourth quarter, but moreover, for the entirety of 2023. Without them, we wouldn't be able to make it happen like we do.And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)The first call is to Amit Daryanani with Evercore.', 'Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani', ""One question for me would be, can you press on the weakness on the industrial market space you talked about seeing softness there, a little bit of inventory (inaudible). I'm curious, is that stable versus what you saw like today? Or do you feel like it's getting worse as you head into '24? And then secondly you can talk about do you see the risk of this (technical difficulty)."", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Yes, Amit, I didn't perfectly hear the second part of your question. There's a little bit of a connection issue. But I think relative to your question, which was, is industrial stable, versus 90 days ago. I mean, look, I think we came into the quarter with an expectation of kind of a modest reduction in sales -- our sales, we're essentially in the line with that. So I think it was kind of what we expected it to be. I would say that the book-to-bill in industrial was a bit weaker. I mean, if we think about why our book-to-bill was 0.95:1. I mean the real driver for that was industrial on 1 side. And we did see in the IT datacom market a little bit of a softer book-to-bill. But that is really just a little bit more of an equalization from very high books-to-bill that we've seen over the prior couple of quarters. So I don't think the IT datacom book-to-bill is at all representative of the demand environment. But I think, in the industrial market, we did see bookings a little softer than we had anticipated.I'm going to assume that your second question is how do we see that going forward and where do we see that kind of cycle in industrial. And -- I think it's early to tell. I mean the beauty of our industrial business is it so broad. And so we're not levered on to one or another of the individual segments. And there are so many segments across the industrial market that we participate in. And we don't have any of those that are really disproportionate to our overall business. And we continue to see some of those segments, areas like marine and oil and gas, rail mass transit, medical during the course of this year. They still had very robust demand. But no doubt about it, areas like factory automation, instrumentation, those are areas where we've seen more marked reductions in demand and also more impact from the distribution channel. When is that going to be worked out in the distribution channel, the inventory, when does some of that demand return in some of those segments. I think it's a little too early to tell. And as we go through the course of this year, we'll try to give you a really good read on that. I mean as we look into here now the first quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do anticipate in the first quarter, a kind of a modest level, but really supported by the acquisitions that we've made. And on an organic basis, we see the first quarter, again, modestly down from our current levels."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Asiya Merchant from Citigroup.', 'Asiya Merchant', ""Hopefully, you can hear me clearly, and I don't have an echo, I will try. On the IT datacom market, if you guys think we share some insight, looks like this market is ramping up quite nicely for you guys. If you could elaborate a little bit on how you think about your wins in the AI segment and how you're able to ramp that into revenues going forward, especially given constraints on supply on the GPU side, how do you guys think you can ramp for AI for the remainder of the year?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Yes. Well, thank you very much, and welcome to our call. I look forward to getting to meet you in person. We're really excited about the progress that the company has made in AI. And I just want to reflect on 1 aspect, which is that AI is not new to us. While the world over the course of the last year has sort of woken up to AI with the advent a year ago, November of ChatGPT and the sort of revolution of generative AI. Our team has been working on the interconnect architecture surrounding AI for a long, long time.And so it is only now that maybe there is this acceleration almost, you could call it even a kind of revolution or a gold rush around AI, but we've been building the capability, building the product capability, building the manufacturing capability and capacity to support that for a long time. And I think this year, one of the ways that we were able to maybe even get a disproportionate share of some of the more urgent demand was that we were very quick to flex our capacity in favor of customers who needed products and when they needed it. And I think our team has always showed the ability to have that agility in reacting to upticks of demand. And I think that this AI is no different. I'm really proud of our team and how they've done that.Looking forward, it's still too early to say what does that look like over the long term. But there's no question in my mind that AI seems like something that is not such a small deal. It seems like something where there are real economics behind it where large companies are making significant investments into AI and where ultimately our architecture -- our interconnect architecture is a very critical component together with the chips that you alluded to.Now relative to shortages of chips, that's -- I mean, we hope that there are significant investments in chip manufacturing because in our industrial business, we do supply a lot of interconnect products that go into the industry for semiconductor manufacturing. I don't think that we've necessarily seen that as a governor on our output or on our customers' demand right now. But we'll see. It's not something that would directly impact except that maybe customers, if they couldn't get enough chips, they would moderate their overall construction. But we haven't seen that yet. And I think our team is just doing a fabulous job dealing with the surge in demand that we saw this year. And it came at a time when overall IT demand was down. But in fact, some of the products were very different products. So it wasn't just that we were able to reallocate capacity from IT products that were not being consumed as much into these, there was a lot of new stuff that we had to do, and I think we did a really great job executing on that."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller comes from Luke Junk with Baird.', 'Luke L. Junk', ""Adam, just hoping you could comment on pricing dynamics into 2024, especially in which parts of the portfolio you might look at as more normal with respect to price downs this year versus areas of the business that could be a laggard in that respect? And then the related question would just be how you're feeling about delivering productivity of your supply chain and your operations to offset any price downs you might face this year."", 'Craig A. Lampo', ""Luke, it's Craig. I'll take that one for Adam. I think as we think about pricing, '23, certainly, we talked about the fact that we didn't necessarily -- we saw pricing coming back to normal. I mean, '22 we talked a lot about pricing adjustments we are making to try to catch up to inflation -- inflationary increases on costs that we saw. And I think that as we came into '23, sequentially, we did a great job on the profitability, but that wasn't necessarily the pricing dynamics. That was more really just operational execution. .And I think the pricing in '23 and as we look into '24 is certainly a more normalized and that the price and cost environment is more balanced. I wouldn't say that the cost environment necessarily has decreased at all. I think there is certainly an elevated level of cost, but they're just not increasing at the pace that we saw a year ago.So from that perspective, I think the pricing environment is in more of a normal situation. And as we move into '24, I don't necessarily think we're going to get necessarily the benefit of price. And historically, that's not something that we would see anyways. And typically, if you have a normal cost environment and normal price environment, I think you'll see kind of typical kind of margins and margin increases from a profitability perspective. We talked about 25% as being a typical target that we have in a normal environment. And I think as we move into '24, I would expect that to be the case kind of sequentially as we move into it.So really happy with where we actually ended the year here at record operating levels. So we're really well positioned, I think, as we move into '24. I mean if you look at our margin improvements, I think that that's something that I'm really proud of the team to be able to actually execute so well during the year to get to these profitability levels. So as we move into '24, I expect that overall environment to be the same, and I certainly expect the team to be able to execute at a similar level."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.', 'Wamsi Mohan', 'Adam, you called out the weakness in 2023 in the communication-related markets, but you did exceed your expectations in the fourth quarter. Do you see a greater than normal organic growth rate over the next 2 years in these markets given the historically easier compares here? And if you could also just talk about the environment in China, that would be really helpful.', 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Well, you're asking me to do a tough thing, which is to talk about the next 2 years, in a very volatile space, which is communications. I think that's hard to say what will be the overall growth across communications. I would tell you we see great opportunities across each of those areas with different things going on because remember, communications, not just IT datacom, it includes mobile networks, it includes mobile devices and obviously, broadband. And I think there's different stuff going on in each of those areas. If you talk just about IT datacom, which is the biggest part of our communications business, I mean there is no doubt that, as I mentioned earlier, these investments in AI, I think we're in early days on this. I think that there are going to be more and more developments around the real kind of creation of new economic models around AI and then the investments to support that. That's already been broadly talked about. You've heard folks talking about pretty significant investments in these next-generation systems. And again, the interconnect products are a really integral part of those systems. So I think on that front, I'm not getting out too ahead of my skis to say that I think at least specific to AI in IT datacom, I would expect over the coming couple of years to see some great opportunities. I don't know about the base of IT datacom over the next 2 years. I couldn't -- I can barely give you a 90-day kind of a very inaccurate guidance for mobile devices.I think that on wireless, we're going through a cycle, which is a typical cycle where they invest in a new type of a standard, they wait to see and by day, I mean the service providers, the operators, they wait to see how does that settle out, how do customers take it? Are customers willing to pay more for the functionality that's delivered by that. And then there starts usually another round of the investments around that. And I think we're in that low period right now. I couldn't tell you when that low period will inflect and become more investment. But I can tell you, for sure, that in the coming years, there will need to be more investments around 5G and ultimately 6G and all the wireless networks because the vast majority of people connecting to the Internet are doing it not on a connection like a Cat 5 cable or in an office, they're doing it on a wireless basis, while they're moving around the world. And so that network is going to have to keep up with the data traffic that continues to expand kind of on an unabated basis.And then finally, broadband. Broadband is an area where I think there is a lot of push in countries like ours and others to ensure that there is both the capacity and the coverage for broadband access because it's viewed not as a luxury, but rather as a necessity that folks can have broadband access. And so I think long term, there's good opportunities there as well.Relative to China, I think I'm very happy to see that the sort of geopolitics of China and the U.S. seems to be the pendulum is swinging towards a more moderate phase. There's more people talking and all of that. And we're encouraged by that. I think the world is a better place when countries are talking rather than arguing and I think that's a good thing. I think there's a lot written about the Chinese macro environment, and I'm not the expert to sort of go off on that. But what I will say is that in those areas of the electronics industries, where we support in China, places like the automotive industry, places like the industrial market, we continue to see great opportunities, and our team continues to do a fabulous job of capitalizing on those opportunities for the domestic market. And we feel really good about the position that we have as a company who is, of course, a global company but who operates through our unique organizational approach as a local company in that environment. And being the best of both worlds at a time like this when the world is somewhat uncertain, is a really good advantage for Amphenol."", 'Operator', 'And our next caller is Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Samik Chatterjee', ""I guess, Adam, I wanted to see if you can share your thoughts around organic growth opportunities for the company in 2024 related to inorganic growth. You have a strong pipeline of revenue from the acquisitions you've closed that you're onboarding, maybe share your thoughts about how you think about the rest of the business growing, whether they are more positive related to negatives in 2024. And what is the average sort of growth average expected of the acquisitions that you closed more recently for 2024?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Yes. Thank you very much, Samik. Again, there seems to be a little bit of a cut out of the sound there. But I think your question is, how do I see the organic growth prospects as opposed to just the acquisitions and I think we feel good about the organic prospects of the company, given all what I talked about each of our individual markets, and I'm not going to go through each of them once again. But I will just tell you that the investments that we've made in next-generation technologies, the work that we've done to support customers when they need us the most over the last 2, 3, 4 years, has positioned us very, very strongly organically to have a strong, robust performance in the years to come.And the other thing I would say as well is we think about acquisitions and obviously, in the first year that you own a company that's considered acquired growth. But we're focused much more on what happens thereafter. And are we acquiring companies that become platforms of future organic growth for the company. And I would tell you, all these 10 companies that we acquired this year, the -- nearly 30 companies that we've acquired since 2019.To me, these companies all represent expanded platforms for future organic growth for the company which makes me feel confident that over time, we will have subject to all of the market dynamics that, for sure, we are not immune to that the company is positioned to have really great organic growth potential."", 'Operator', 'And our next caller is Andrew Buscaglia with BNP.', 'Andrew Edouard Buscaglia', ""I just wanted to ask on IT datacom, again, with AI, the past couple of quarters, you called out sequential -- attributed sequential improvements to AI. But would you say the same thing took place in Q4? And then that plus your guidance, would you imply -- is this -- because we can't see that AI piece in that business. Would you say it's continuing to accelerate on a sequential basis?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Thank you very much, Andrew. Yes, I think what I said in my remarks is that we saw growth in AI, and we saw also growth in the underlying business. So I think over the last couple of quarters, I've described that all of our upside, all of our sequential growth really did come from AI. I think that this quarter, it's some of each, which is actually really encouraging for us that we've seen maybe what one could call a bottoming of the underlying IT demand. Are we continuing to make progress in AI? Do we see continued acceleration opportunities? Yes, I wouldn't say that every quarter, it's going to accelerate in lockstep like it did over the course of Q2 and Q3. But for sure, we see opportunities long term to be generating sales related to AI that are greater than we are today."", 'Operator', 'And our next caller is Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.', 'Mark Trevor Delaney', ""Happy New Year to all of you as well. Automotive has been a fast-growing market for the company. However, several auto OEMs have been seen slower EV sales and they said they're going to rethink how fast they want to shift their production towards EVs. And so I'm hoping to better understand if you think that will create any meaningful near to intermediate-term challenges for Amphenol that could limit the company's growth over market or perhaps lead to some inventory destocking?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Well, thank you very much, Mark, and Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we read all the same papers, and we hear about the sort of discussions about slowdowns in EV sales. And I think we shouldn't forget that this is a fairly western dynamic. I don't think we hear, for example, in Asia and specifically in the largest car market in the world, China, about folks turning their back on EVs and going back to internal combustion engine. But we do hear a little bit about that, I think, here and in Europe.And as I've described, I mean, we don't care if a car has an EV drivetrain or not. What we care about, does a car have a lot of electronics in it and new electronic systems. Among those systems are certainly electrified drivetrains or hybrid electric drivetrains. And I think that what we've seen in Asia, what we've seen in Europe, what we've seen in North America is that there is a real acceleration of the adoption of electronics in cars period. And some of that may actually be related to the fact that EVs tend to be a little more fancy electronically.And I think car companies are seeing that and upgrading their standard companies to incorporate more electronic functionality. And whenever you have electronic functionality in a car, regardless of the drivetrain, you're going to have new interconnect solutions. You're going to have new sensor solutions. You're going to have new antenna solutions. And those are the 3 areas of our participation in the automotive market. For sure, if I go to like the largest EV market, China, for example, I mean, there continues to be unabated a real adoption. And I would almost say that EVs in that market have kind of reached a sort of escape velocity where they're just really normal. I mean you see them all over the place. And I think our team there just did a fabulous job of getting a breadth of penetration across both domestic and international EV manufacturers, whereby we really are able to enjoy the benefits of that.And I think in Europe and in North America, we've done a great job, but we've also done a really great job on capitalizing upon some of these new electronics. And so I wouldn't put any dynamic here in the category of something that we view as a real near or medium-term challenge. I think quite the contrary, as car companies struggle to figure out how they can sell their products and make more money from doing it, they're always going to fall back on electronics as the way to do that. And that's a good thing for Amphenol."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is William Stein with Truist Securities.', 'William Stein', ""Adam, I'm hoping you can comment on the aperture for M&A and products within it. I think historically, you've talked about not wanting to acquire system-level solutions. And I think at least 1 of the acquisitions you've done recently has such products. And I wonder if that could potentially be something you'll grow into and expand or if we should see you perhaps shyaway of that business going forward?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Well, thank you so much. I think what you're alluding to is PCTEL and the fact that they have a very small test and measurement business and really wonderful people, wonderful products, but that's not why we bought PCTEL. And just -- you'll recall, we've acquired companies in the past, some of which are not purely the things that we were looking to acquire. And we're always very sensitive that we're never going to put ourselves in a competitive situation with our customers. And really PCTEL is known for their antenna technologies, which are fabulous. Not to say a bad word about their team that works in test and measurement, but we're not adopting a strategy to go after system-level products.In terms of our aperture for M&A, I mean we just see fabulous opportunities. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, I think we have demonstrated an ability to acquire companies really across the board from a size perspective. We've demonstrated the ability to acquire a lot of companies and to process those effectively. And our small little headquarters team here, they may have been a little bit busier than normal over the last year with these 10 acquisitions. But the beauty is because of our organizational structure, now having 14 groups across 3 global divisions, we have the wherewithal to make sure that those acquisitions get really their due attention when they become part of Amphenol.And I think the near-term pipeline remains a very robust pipeline, and we look forward to taking advantage of that. We will always remain a very disciplined buyer as we have forever, I am willing to walk away at the very last moment, if I have to, if something we find is not to our liking, we'll always pay a reasonable price, a fair price for great companies. We may not always be the highest priced buyer, but I think we are often the best buyer because of our effectiveness, our willingness to work aggressively to get things done.And the fact is our organizational structure allows those newly acquired companies to become part of Amphenol in a very unobtrusive fashion. They joined seamlessly. They come in and on Day 1, they just keep operating like they were doing on all the days before. And that is a relatively low-risk approach to acquisition because we're not going in and just over -- just sort of having these kind of convulsive restructurings of the company, where you run the risk of destroying what you didn't even know you had. So we look forward to continuing to have great acquisitions in the future, but we're not going to be a kind of a system-level company. We know what we are. We're an interconnect company. There are wonderful opportunities for interconnect products to be expanded, both organically and through acquisition going forward, lots of really attractive companies out there, and we'll continue to position ourselves so the ones that match with us, the ones that go through our really rigorous kind of rubicon of deciding whether or not to buy them, we'll be in a good position to execute on those over the near, medium and long term."", 'Operator', 'And our next call is Chris Snyder with UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I wanted to follow-up on some of the earlier conversation on AI. So it sounds like book-to-bill for AI moderated sequentially, maybe after some early outsized orders just given the company's foundation in that market. So I guess the question is, do you think that this moderation is a single quarter phenomenon? Or would you expect that to persist for multiple quarters? Because it does seem like the top line is still continuing to grow sequentially?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Thanks very much, Chris. Yes. I mean, look, I don't usually talk about book-to-bill by submarkets. But I will tell you that, for sure, I mean, we had very strong bookings in AI-related applications in Q2 and Q3. And so it's not surprising that here in Q4, our IT datacom book-to-bill was a bit below and -- sorry, a bit below 1. And because of those significant orders that we received, which customers wanted to place because they need the product and then we're executing upon those orders.And yes, I think that our IT datacom business is in a good position looking forward. I mean our guidance for the first quarter is to have a little moderation, which is not abnormal this time of year -- actually quite normal, let me say that. And layered on top of that, I think the AI is a good thing to have. So -- no, I think you characterized it quite well."", 'Operator', 'Our next call is Joseph Giordano with TD Cowen.', 'Michael Anastasiou', 'This is Michael on for Joe. So earlier, you had mentioned commentary regarding orders and specific markets. Can you just provide like a high level, maybe book-to-bill on a consolidated basis for the quarter? Or any color there?', 'Richard Adam Norwitt', 'About earlier that our book-to-bill was 0.95:1 for the quarter.', 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.', 'Steven Bryant Fox', ""I guess broadly speaking, the latest round of acquisitions were around sensors, antennas and assemblies. I was just curious, like, Adam, your updated thoughts on your M&A focus by technology, especially in the context of what looks like gross margins that are now at the 33% level. I guess some of these products have lower gross margins, some have higher. I don't know if there's a mix impact that's influencing the gross margin now with the M&A. But just broadly speaking, when you -- the general buckets of technology that you look at, what is your thinking of what you've done and where you need to go now?"", 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Well, thanks very much, Steve. Yes. I mean, look, in the quarter, we acquired companies who make sensors, antennas, cable and cable assemblies and really high-technology cable actually that has really great value for its customers. And we continue to see acquisition opportunities across really all of our interconnect products from discrete connectors to cable, cable assembly, value-add -- complex value-add interconnect products, sensors, complex sensor interconnect assemblies, antennas and the like. And we're really pleased to continue to find companies across all of those products. I wouldn't tell you that we think so much about gross margin by product. We see great margin opportunities as you know. And Craig has said it so many times, we're very much focused on operating margins. And yes, I mean, some of these companies do operate below our corporate average, not all of them, by the way, but some of them do.And I think we -- that doesn't relate at all to their product type. We don't believe that there is a correlation between whether someone makes a connector, a sensor and antenna a cable or a cable assembly that, that is necessarily going to put them in a certain bucket of profit potential. We actually see great profit potential for all companies. And that's 1 of the ways we screen for acquisitions. I mean we're not going to buy a company if we don't see the long-term potential for that company to elevate its profitability to at or above our corporate average. Now we do have industry-leading margins. And so most of the companies that we do acquire tend to be lower than we are. And then it's our job and their job becoming part of the Amphenol family to bring those margins up over time. But it's really not at all correlated to the type of products that they sell."", 'Operator', 'And our last question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.', 'Matthew John Sheerin', 'Yes. Adam, in your commentary on mobile devices, you mentioned that tablets and notebook PCs continue to be weak. But we are hearing some chatter about expectations for a potential refresh -- PC refresh cycle playing out in the next year or 2. So wondering if you have any visibility into that? And can you give us a sense of the content opportunity for Amphenol within notebooks, particularly in the next-generation so-called AI-enabled PCs?', 'Richard Adam Norwitt', ""Great. Thanks so much, Matt. Look, I hope what you say is the case. We certainly hope that there is a refresh. Look, I think we've talked about this year and even a little bit last year, the strength that we've seen in phones this year, which was more than offset, in particular, by things like laptops and tablets. It had to do with the clear fact that during the pandemic and when everybody went to work from home and study from home, there was an enormous rush to buy new devices, which caused a surge and really kind of upset the normal replacement cycle of those products.And so I guess that one could expect that if everybody bought a bunch of stuff in 2020 and 2021 and if those things tend to last 3, 4, 5 years, that eventually you would hope to see a little bit of a refresh. I don't know -- I can't tell you I have any information to support that. I'm sure you're getting your information from even wiser sources than I would have. Relative to the content, we do see great content opportunities in these devices as they get more complex, as they get more different wireless standards that they have to support, as they have higher speeds, as they have more fine pitch and more precision inside of them, all of these create opportunities for Amphenol long term.We've always said about the mobile device market, and that includes tablets and laptops and the like, that to the extent that there is a premium on the hardware of the product that can create opportunities for Amphenol over the long term. And I think that will -- whether that's related to AI or not, that I have -- I can't necessarily connect those dots. But for sure, people are going to need new devices in the future, and we'll be happy to enable the interconnect products across those devices.Well, operator, if that was our last question, I guess I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody here today for spending a little bit of your time with us. I wish that you all have a good continuation of your winter weather wherever you may be. And we look forward to talking to all of you just 90 days from now. Thanks so much."", 'Craig A.

However, the average price may be lower due to extra costs at Olympias.', 'As production increases, the all-in-sustaining costs are expected to decrease and could drop below $1,125 per ounce.', 'However, due to the high capital expenditure needed to develop Skouries, the free cash flow might not be as positive as originally anticipated. The free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023 is predicted to be approximately $15 million.', ""Further, as of the third quarter, the company's cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities summed up to $476.75 million.

With gold trading above $2,000 in 2024, the company will have no problem."", 'Eldorado Gold is expected to perform well in 2024 due to the likelihood of gold reaching a record-high level. As previously announced, this expectation assumes the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates. However, the company is currently in a consolidation phase, specifically in a triangle pattern, until the end of February.', 'During this period, it is important to accumulate the stock and trade short-term LIFO for about 50% of your position. It is also recommended to wait for clear indicators of an imminent breakout before moving further.', 'Eldorado Gold is forming an ascending triangle pattern, with resistance at $13.50 and support at $12.10.', ""This pattern is considered bullish, indicating the stock's value may increase soon. The resistance level of $13.50 is expected to be reached again more quickly. If the resistance level is crossed, we may see a breakout to $14.25 before the stock returns to $13.50, which will become the new support level. However, the gold price outlook may not be favorable in the short term, with significant fluctuations expected."", 'It may be a good idea to sell approximately 50% of the shares at a trading range of $13.25 to $13.65 (using the LIFO method) and anticipate potential higher resistance at $14.25 in the medium term. In contrast, if the gold price continues to decline, it may be wise to accumulate shares between $12.25 and $11.75, with potential support at $10.60 for a profitable outcome.', 'As always, watch the gold price like a hawk.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Let's look at their performances in light of their competitive advantages to see which is likely to deliver more dividend income to your brokerage account over the long run."", ""Last April, Johnson & Johnson raised its dividend payout for the 61st year in a row. The well-established healthcare conglomerate isn't growing its payout by leaps and bounds, but it is up a healthy 32% over the past five years. At recent prices, it offers a 3% dividend yield."", ""Johnson & Johnson's medical technology segment and its pharmaceuticals business benefit from a slew of marketing authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulators around the world. For example, sales of Darzalex, a drug first approved by the FDA to treat multiple myeloma in 2015, rose 22% last year to reach $9.7 billion."", ""Darzalex isn't the only blockbuster cancer drug to emerge from J&J's pipeline lately. Balversa, a targeted treatment for bladder cancer patients, recently earned full approval to treat patients who failed their first course of treatment. Clinical trial results that show Balversa reduced this difficult-to-treat patient group's risk of death by 36% compared to standard chemotherapy could soon drive sales up past $1 billion annually."", 'Rising sales of both pharmaceuticals and medical technology allowed J&J to report 2023 revenue that grew a healthy 6.5% year over year.

That puts the telecom giant's payout among the highest yields in the S&P 500, where the average is 1.5%."", ""However, while a higher-yielding payout often indicates a higher risk of a future reduction, that's growing increasingly unlikely for Verizon. That's clear in the company's financial results from last year and outlook for 2024. "", ""Verizon recently reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2023. On the one hand, the telecom giant reported declining revenue and earnings in both periods. Here's a snapshot of its income statement for the fourth quarter:"", ""As that graphic shows, Verizon's total revenue dipped 0.3% during the period. Meanwhile, it posted a massive $2.6 billion net loss."", ""However, those numbers don't even begin to tell the whole story. While Verizon reported a loss for the period, that was entirely due to several non-cash charges, including a $5.8 billion goodwill impairment charge for its business reporting unit. Strip away those one-time items, and Verizon posted a profit for the period and full year, albeit at a lower rate compared to 2022."", ""While Verizon's revenue and earnings were lower, its cash flow improved. Cash from operating activities increased by $400 million last year to $37.5 billion. Meanwhile, Verizon used $18.8 billion of that money to fund capital expenses, which was $4.3 billion less than in 2022.\xa0That enabled Verizon to produce $18.7 billion of free cash flow last year, a $4.6 billion improvement. This amount easily covered Verizon's $11 billion dividend outlay, enabling it to produce $7.7 billion in excess free cash."", ""The company used that money to strengthen its balance sheet. That enabled it to reduce its leverage ratio from 2.7 times at the end of 2022 to 2.6 times at the end of last year. The company's growing free cash flow and falling leverage ratio help support its solid credit rating (A-/BBB+/Baa1). Those factors also mean its high-yielding dividend is on an even firmer foundation."", 'Last year was a ""year of change"" for Verizon, according to comments by CEO Hans Vestberg in the fourth-quarter earnings release. He noted that the company ""deliver[ed] continuous improvement throughout 2023"" and ""we ended the year strong and continue to pursue the right balance of growth and profitability."" That drives his belief that Verizon has ""the right assets and the best team in place and are well-positioned for growth in 2024.""', 'The company expects total wireless service revenue to rise by 2% to 3.5% next year, building on its solid results from last year when this revenue source increased by 3.2%. Meanwhile, Verizon expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to improve by 1% to 3% in 2023 after falling 0.2% last year.', ""While the company didn't provide cash flow guidance for 2024, those metrics should also improve. Verizon's growing revenue and adjusted EBITDA should trickle down to its operating cash flow, which should continue rising this year. Meanwhile, free cash flow should be strong because the company expects capital spending to fall to a range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion this year. As a result, it should generate lots of free cash flow after paying dividends this year to strengthen its balance sheet."", 'Because of that, the company should have the flexibility to continue increasing its payout. It raised its dividend by around 2% last September, marking its 17th straight year of increasing the payout. That maintained the longest current streak of dividend increases in the U.S. telecom sector.', ""Verizon's big-time dividend is on an increasingly firm foundation. The telecom giant is producing rising free cash flow as capital spending falls, giving it more money to strengthen its already solid balance sheet. With more improvement expected in 2024, Verizon is an excellent option for investors seeking a lower-risk, high-yielding dividend."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with VZ.', ""On January 23, 2024, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) released its 8-K filing, detailing the company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. As a leading provider of technology and communications services, Verizon has shown resilience in its wireless segment, which accounts for the majority of its service revenue and operating income. The company serves a vast customer base with approximately 92 million postpaid and 22 million prepaid phone customers, bolstered by its nationwide network and the acquisition of Tracfone."", ""Verizon's financial results for 2023 reflect a mix of achievements and challenges. The company's wireless service revenue grew by 3.2% for the full year, reaching $76.7 billion, driven by pricing actions and the adoption of higher premium plans. Fixed wireless net additions also saw a significant increase, indicating strong demand for Verizon's product offerings. However, the company faced a decline in total operating revenue, which decreased by 2.1% to $134.0 billion for the full year, attributed to lower wireless equipment revenue and a decrease in total postpaid upgrades."", ""The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the full year stood at $2.75, a sharp decline from $5.06 in 2022. Adjusted EPS, excluding special items, was $4.71, compared to $5.18 in the previous year. This decline in EPS was influenced by a pre-tax loss from special items amounting to approximately $7.8 billion, including a significant goodwill impairment charge related to the Business reporting unit."", ""Despite these challenges, Verizon's cash flow from operations increased slightly to $37.5 billion, and the company reported a robust free cash flow of $18.7 billion, up from $14.1 billion in 2022. These figures underscore the company's ability to generate cash and maintain financial flexibility."", ""Verizon's financial achievements in 2023, particularly in wireless customer growth and cash flow improvement, are critical for the company's long-term strategy in the competitive telecommunications industry. The increase in wireless service revenue and fixed wireless net additions demonstrates the company's strong position in the market and its ability to attract and retain customers. The improvement in free cash flow is also a positive indicator for investors, as it provides the company with the resources to invest in network improvements, pay down debt, and return value to shareholders."", 'However, the decline in total operating revenue and EPS presents challenges that Verizon will need to address. The competitive landscape of the telecommunications industry requires continuous investment in technology and network infrastructure to meet customer demands and stay ahead of competitors. The decrease in operating revenue and the substantial goodwill impairment charge highlight the need for Verizon to reassess its business strategies, particularly within its Business reporting unit.', 'Looking ahead to 2024, Verizon expects total wireless service revenue growth of 2.0% to 3.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.0% to 3.0%.

He says AT&T\'s ongoing challenge is lack of growth.', 'Moffett sees AT&T\'s 5G network buildout ""largely"" complete, but questions if it can drive revenues yet, calling it ""a running in place type of investment and an expensive one at that."" He\'s also skeptical of convergence opportunities from fiber investments that he says will only cover about 25% of the country, leaving most untouched.', 'Instead, he calls cable operators ""more interesting,"" positioned to win if convergence accelerates versus phone companies with limited fiber reach.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith."", ""SEANA SMITH: All right, let's take a look at one of the trending tickers here this morning, and that is AT&T. Reporting results before the bell, missing on earnings, even as it added more customers than expected here. Now this comes as Verizon came out with its earnings on Tuesday, which came in strong."", ""So what's the play in the telecom space this year? We want to bring in Craig Moffett. He's MoffettNathanson's co-founder and senior analyst. All right, Craig let's talk about this. Let's start with AT&T, because we're looking at losses of shares just about 2%. There certainly were tidbits in this report that investors are taking issue with. But my question to you is, what do you think these results tell us just about the fundamentals of AT&T's business?"", 'CRAIG MOFFETT: Well, look, overall, it was a quarter that was more or less what you expected. The results in subscribers-- and you have to start, like any subscription business, with the subscriber counts. And the subscriber counts were pretty good.', ""I think the challenge here is you look at this company, and it's really not growing. It hasn't grown faster than the rate of inflation in a decade. You've had a lot of tailwinds during that period for wireless overall. And you look forward, they're not guiding to any material earnings growth."", ""I think that's why the market is reacting negatively this morning is the market had expected some material EPS growth. And you know, what you see is what you get with these companies. They're very slow growth companies. They pay a decent dividend. But the capital appreciation story hasn't worked in 30 years for the telcos."", ""BRAD SMITH: You know, Craig, as the call had been taking place this morning, perhaps a lot of the focus may have not just been on the additions for subscribers, but also where the company is investing further here. Is there any of that investment, that CapEx that's going to be going out the door that you believe AT&T has to get right in order to hit its next inflection point for investors?"", ""CRAIG MOFFETT: Well, look, they have largely finished building out the 5G network, as have their peers. But the real question now is whether 5G will materialize as a real revenue driver. So far, it hasn't. It's been sort of a running in place type of investment, and an expensive one at that."", ""On the wireline side of the business, what I scratch my head over is the convergence strategy, right? They spoke a lot on their conference call about the power of convergence and the ability to offer a wired broadband solution and a wireless broadband solution. That's a lot of what's driving the capital investment that they're making in fiber."", ""Well, that's fine, but their fiber network will eventually cover something like 25% of the United States. What do you do with the other 75% of the country? They talk about it as though they're advantaged, but I think a better way to characterize it is they are perhaps less disadvantaged than their peers."", ""But if convergence really happens, the cable operators are going to win the war, because cable operators can offer a converged solution everywhere, and the telephone companies that they compete with can't. And that's actually why I think, for me, particularly with expectations quite low for the cable operators. The cable operators are more interesting at this point than the phone companies are.""]"

That's not surprising. Its dominance in the AI chip market has been driving outstanding top- and bottom-line growth for the company."", ""The good part is that Wall Street and investors are positive about Nvidia's prospects in 2024 and beyond as the AI chip market gains steam. This explains why Nvidia stock has already risen 20% in 2024. However, Nvidia's solid start to the year on the stock market has been eclipsed by Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), which has already clocked eye-popping gains of nearly 50% this month."", ""Let's look at the reasons why shares of Supermicro -- as it's more commonly known -- have been soaring and why investors should consider buying it hand over fist straight away."", 'In a business update provided by Supermicro on Jan. 18, the company announced significantly upgraded guidance for the second quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended on Dec. 31, 2023). The company -- known for providing modular server solutions, which are in solid demand as they are used for deploying AI chips -- is now anticipating fiscal Q2 revenue to land at $3.62 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range.', ""It was earlier forecasting $2.8 billion for the previous quarter, which means that it has increased its revenue estimate by almost 30%. Additionally, Supermicro is expecting its adjusted earnings to land between $5.40 and $5.55 per share, up significantly from the earlier range of $4.40 to $4.88 per share. The updated guidance suggests that Supermicro's revenue is set to double on a year-over-year basis, while its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings would increase 68% from the same period last year."", ""The big increase in Supermicro's guidance and the impressive year-over-year growth that it is set to deliver was rewarded with a sharp jump in the company's stock price. But it is worth noting that Supermicro stock continues to trade at an attractive valuation despite its latest surge."", ""The company sports a price-to-sales ratio of just over 3. That's incredibly cheap when compared to Nvidia's sales multiple of 33. What's more, Supermicro's trailing earnings multiple of 39 is also much lower than Nvidia's multiple of 65. Additionally, Supermicro is trading at just 7 times forward earnings, which points toward the impressive bottom-line growth that the company is expected to deliver."", ""According to consensus estimates, Supermicro's earnings could increase 51% in fiscal 2024 to $17.88 per share, compared to $11.81 per share in fiscal 2023. Even better, the company is forecast to deliver impressive growth over the next couple of years as well."", ""Assuming Supermicro does hit $27.50 per share in earnings in fiscal 2026 and trades at the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 29 then (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could jump to $800 in just over a couple of years. That points toward 85% gains from current levels."", 'A closer look at the market Supermicro serves will show you just why it could indeed deliver such outstanding growth, and why investors would do well to buy this AI stock while it is still trading at attractive levels.', 'Supermicro\'s server solutions have been in terrific demand thanks to the growing adoption of AI. That\'s not surprising as the company claims that its server solutions ""maximize [the] parallel computing power of GPUs to handle billions if not trillions of AI model parameters to be trained with massive datasets that are exponentially growing.""', ""Supermicro offers server solutions that can be used to deploy multiple types of AI accelerators, ranging from Nvidia's popular H100 chip to Intel and Advanced Micro Devices' offerings as well. As a result, data center operators have been lining up to buy its server solutions, which can reportedly help them reduce cooling and electricity costs."", 'The demand for Supermicro\'s server racks is so strong that the company recently upgraded its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 racks a month from the earlier capacity of 4,000. So, the company\'s updated guidance doesn\'t seem surprising considering the 25% jump in its manufacturing capacity, which will help it serve a ""strong market and end customer demand for our rack-scale, AI and Total IT Solutions.""', ""With the AI server market expected to grow fivefold between 2023 and 2027, generating an annual revenue of $150 billion at the end of the forecast period, Supermicro is at the beginning of a lucrative growth opportunity. The good part is that Supermicro is setting itself up to capitalize on this massive market by investing in more capacity. According to George Wang of Barclays, the company's new facility in Malaysia, which is expected to go online in the second half of fiscal 2024, could help it generate $30 billion in revenue."", ""Given the solid demand for AI servers, Supermicro should ideally be able to sell almost all the capacity that it brings online. That could lead to a massive jump in the company's revenue considering that it reported a top line of $7.1 billion in fiscal 2023. As a result, investors would do well to buy this growth stock hand over fist since it could sustain its red-hot rally and soar impressively in the long run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

It wasn't until 1995, however, when it changed the landscape of the PC business forever. That's when Nvidia debuted the world's first-ever mainstream consumer-oriented graphics processing card. This tech made personal computers much more engaging, largely by making them high-powered video gaming consoles. The rest, as they say, is history. Leveraging its leading position in the graphics card space, Nvidia has since grown from its relatively small 1999 public offering to the $1.5 trillion powerhouse it is today. From back then to now, Nvidia stock's soared to the tune of 150,000%. Wow!"", ""Granted, most investors likely didn't stick with the stock that whole time.

It doesn't have to handle highly complex calculations. It just needs to simultaneously handle mountains and mountains of digital data very rapidly. Recognizing this, in 2012 Nvidia began experimenting with purpose-built AI processors using its graphics card tech. The 2016 release of its DGX-1 system marked the world's first-ever deep-learning supercomputer, dropping the company right into the heart of the then-brewing artificial intelligence evolution. It was a brilliant move too. AI now accounts for around three-fourths of the organization's revenue and is responsible for the lion's share of its revenue growth."", 'The artificial intelligence party is just getting started though. Institutions are only just now starting to see the full potential of owning their own AI platforms. UIPath\'s CEO Robert Enslin recently opined that ""Companies need to think about how to apply AI and automation to all parts of their business,"" for instance, concluding that ""All companies need to be tech companies.""', 'The companies he\'s speaking of don\'t seem to disagree either. Even cosmetics brand L\'Oreal\'s chief executive Nicolas Hieronimus believes ""We are a tech company.

The software sliver of the artificial intelligence market -- which Nvidia also serves -- is projected to swell from around $200 billion per year now to more than $1 trillion in 2032, again according to Precedence Research.', ""Already in control of the vast majority of the artificial intelligence hardware market, Nvidia is positioned to capture its fair share of the market's growth."", ""The backdrop is bullish to be sure. Nvidia's the leading name in one of the market's hottest long-term growth opportunities, after all. Risk is low and the potential reward is high."", ""There is one footnote to add to the Nvidia story though. That is, Nvidia is a popular, well-watched stock that dishes out a great deal of volatility. Shares also tend to be priced at a rich valuation, exacerbating that volatility. And these aren't limited to short-term swings. Nvidia stock can really ebb and flow for a while, even when things are clearly going well for the company."", ""Most veteran investors understand, however, they'll need to remain plugged into mega-trends for years on end if they want to become millionaires.

While many Wall Street analysts are now projecting slower economic growth in 2024, the possibility of a recession seems to be quite low. Coupled with improving earnings projections for the S&P 500 stocks, analysts now expect the index to gain 8% to 9% in 2024 -- a little lower than the index's long-term historical average annual return of 10%."", ""Traders do not expect the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts to start until May 2023 due to stronger-than-expected economic data and indications of a continued battle with inflation. However, once the central bank starts cutting rates, it is expected to continue to do so five times in late 2024.\xa0Subsequently, the stock market and the S&P 500 will most likely start rallying meaningfully in the latter part of 2024."", ""That's why now may be a good time to start taking up small positions in growth stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), which are expected to grow faster than the overall market."", ""Last year was a rewarding one for Nvidia, with shares surging 246%. Much of this rally is attributed to Nvidia's undisputed leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. A diverse array of clients such as consumer internet firms, cloud service providers, and enterprises now rely on Nvidia's comprehensive suite of CPUs, GPUs, networking technologies, and AI-optimized software to build AI infrastructure and run enterprise AI applications."", ""Nvidia's future looks even brighter with data centers focusing on transitioning from CPU-based to GPU-based or accelerated computing-based infrastructure. This is driven by data centers focusing on increasing productivity and running power-hungry high-performance computing, data analytics, and AI workloads. CEO Jensen Huang estimated that data centers will be spending nearly $1 trillion on these investments in the next four years, translating into nearly $250 billion in capital expenditures annually. With its cutting-edge GPUs optimized for training and inferencing or real-time running of large language models and for running generative AI applications, Nvidia seems positioned to capitalize on the trend. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a leading provider of high-performance networking technologies, in 2020 further strengthened the company's position in the data center market."", 'Nvidia is also seeing solid demand for its AI chips and software from major enterprises like Snowflake, ServiceNow, Adobe, and Databricks integrating AI assistants into their platforms. This broader trend across industries toward developing customized AI applications can prove to be a major tailwind for the company.', ""To leverage these opportunities, Nvidia is focusing on accelerating the pace of new architecture release for data center chips from every two years to every year. The company is also making significant inroads in the software segment and can reach an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 31, 2024) for its recurring software, support, and service offerings. Nvidia's software solutions are playing a major role in enabling enterprises to leverage generative AI and other AI technologies."", ""There is no doubt that Nvidia seems pretty expensive, trading at 34 times trailing 12-month sales.

The report highlighted the decrease in the renewal value and period of the company\'s contract with the U.S. Army, citing ""data ownership"" issues as one of the pain points. Despite this issue, Palantir\'s forte in helping various government and commercial entities efficiently analyze extensive datasets and uncover hidden insights continues to be a major competitive edge.', ""Palantir's focus on providing products and services that help combat violent and immoral actors has helped foster brand recognition and trust among its government client base. The company recently launched Palantir Government Web Services to support emerging and existing defense technology companies in scaling their mission-critical capabilities. Hence, while Palantir's government revenue grew by only 12% year over year to $308 million in the third quarter, there is still huge growth potential in this relatively stable business."", 'Palantir also saw its third-quarter commercial revenue rise 23% year over year to $251 million, while the commercial business reached a $1 billion annualized run rate in the third quarter.', ""Furthermore, the recently launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which integrates the company's existing machine learning capabilities with large language models, is also proving to be a major growth catalyst. The company opted for AIP Bootcamps, which allow potential clients to work on real workflows with actual client data in five or fewer days. This is a significant improvement from the traditional pilot-based go-to-market strategy, which may require one to three months. Since customers get real-time experience working with AIP, it results in faster negotiations and improved unit economics."", 'Although Palantir is trading at 17.7 times the trailing 12-month sales ratio, far higher than the software industry median of 2.3, it is still an attractive buy based on its robust growth potential.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

At the beginning of 2020, Nvidia had an enterprise value of $136 billion while Amazon was worth $889 billion.', 'But today, Nvidia is worth $1.46 trillion and Amazon is worth $1.60 trillion. Both of those tech giants kept growing over the past four years, but Nvidia closed in on Amazon as the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market lit a raging fire under its data center business.', 'Could this red-hot chipmaker actually overtake the e-commerce and cloud leader by 2025?', ""Nvidia's revenue declined 7% in fiscal 2020, which ended in January 2020, as it struggled with the slower growth of the PC gaming market, the decline of cryptocurrency prices -- which drove miners to flood the market with secondhand GPUs -- and supply chain disruptions caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic."", 'But in fiscal 2021, its revenue surged 53% as the gaming and AI markets heated up again. That growth continued over the following year and its revenue soared 61% in fiscal 2022.', ""In fiscal 2023, its revenue growth flatlined as PC sales dropped in a post-pandemic market and the macro headwinds forced data center operators to rein in their spending. By the end of the year, many analysts expected Nvidia's revenue to grow only about 10% in fiscal 2024. However, those conservative forecasts didn't account for the explosive growth of the generative AI market over the past year -- which drove many companies to accumulate Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks. That's why the same analysts now expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 119% to $59.1 billion in fiscal 2024 (which finalizes at the end of this month)."", 'If Nvidia matches that target, it will have grown its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52.5% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024. Amazon is expected to grow its revenue at a CAGR of 19.4% from 2019 to 2023.', 'Amazon also experienced a boom and bust cycle over the past four years. Its growth initially accelerated during the pandemic as more people shopped online and companies ramped up their spending on cloud-based services, but it slowed down as those tailwinds dissipated. Inflation and rising interest rates exacerbated that slowdown -- but its core e-commerce and cloud businesses have gradually stabilized over the past year.', ""The bulls believe Nvidia's sales will keep soaring as it sells more data center chips, which made up 80% of its revenue in its latest quarter, and its gaming business grows again. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 36% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 as the AI market continues to expand. They also expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 38%."", 'We should take those estimates with a grain of salt since those analysts were largely blindsided by the generative AI boom, but the long-term forecasts for the AI industry reinforce that bullish outlook. The broader AI market could grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2023 to 2032, according to Precedence Research, while Fortune Business Insights believes the generative AI niche will expand at an even faster CAGR of 47.5%.', ""Nvidia's stock isn't cheap at 33 times next year's earnings, but its dominance of the growing data center and gaming GPU markets could justify that higher valuation. But Nvidia still needs to overcome some unpredictable challenges, including the latest export curbs on advanced AI chips to China; the development of first-party AI chips by major customers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI; and a potential supply glut caused by companies accumulating too many data center GPUs."", ""Yet Nvidia could still grow faster than Amazon, which is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at a CAGR of 12% and 34%, respectively, from 2023 to 2025. And at 43 times next year's earnings, Amazon's stock still looks pricier than Nvidia's."", ""Based on all these facts, Nvidia could easily become more valuable than Amazon by the end of 2025. Its stock would only need to rise about 10% from its current levels to lift its enterprise value past Amazon's, and it could continue to outperform the e-commerce and cloud leader over the next two years as the AI market continues growing."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Data from the CFA Institute showed that since the end of the financial crisis, growth stocks outperformed value stocks by 144% through June 2018.

The firm said quality stocks can have higher valuations on a relative basis but it said quality stocks would be worth paying for this year.', '""Quality stocks have historically outperformed in the late stages of the business cycle, including in periods of economic contraction, which should offer portfolio protection if the economy slows more than we expect. The quality tilt also aligns with our preference for US technology companies, which should be among the key beneficiaries of AI-related demand for both hardware and software.

This amount is equivalent to 4.5% of net loss reserves as of Sep 30, 2023.Vince Tizzio, president and CEO of AXIS Capital, stated, ""Axis Capital delivered strong underlying performance in 2023 and it is believed that the company is on a clear trajectory to become a specialty underwriting leader. In 2023, the company generated consistent premium growth with double-digit increases across the vast majority of the specialty insurance lines, and further improved and streamlined the operating model.”AXS has been witnessing an increase in its top line over a considerable period of time on the back of higher net premiums earned and improved net investment income. Repositioning of the portfolio, carried out over the past three years, will continue to drive its performance. Its stronger book of businesses has less inherent volatility. The company has brought down PMLs, decreased limits and exited or reduced its participation in underperforming businesses while pushing for higher rates across the board.At the same time, it is focused on driving growth in its most attractive lines. In the Insurance segment, with respect to property, AXIS Capital continues to witness favorable market conditions in each of the platforms. AXS expects disciplined pricing to persist in both insurance and reinsurance in 2023. The company expects positive conditions to sustain into 2024 across all of the property lines.AXIS Capital is a major specialty insurer and global reinsurer, aiming for leadership in specialty risks. The company thus remains focused on growth in Marine Cargo, Cyber and Renewable Energy, which is likely to provide a strong double-digit return on equity (ROE) opportunities. The company’s combined insurance and reinsurance portfolios have witnessed average rate increases in the double digits.AXIS Capital’s ROE determines its growth potential. The company’s annualized operating return on average common equity was 18.4% in the first nine months of 2023, which expanded 820 basis points year over year. The increase was primarily driven by an improvement in underwriting income and net investment income and a decrease in average common shareholder\'s equity. It was partially offset by income tax expense and an increase in corporate expenses. ROE is a profitability measure that shows how efficiently the company is utilizing shareholders’ money.Shares of AXIS Capital have gained 1.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 7.6%.

Cohen already let the case proceed against Fox News — and on Wednesday, he rejected a request by Fox Corporation to throw out the claims against the parent company.', 'The lawsuit was filed in the wake of the 2020 election, when Fox repeatedly gave airtime to far-right figures who promoted outrageous and debunked claims that Smartmatic rigged the presidential election by flipping millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. They did this even though on-air anchors, top producers and executives privately admitted that the election wasn’t stolen.', 'The judge said Smartmatic’s case was strong enough to proceed against the parent company because it has “sufficiently alleged that (Fox) Corp. employees acted with malice by purposely and deliberating publishing knowingly false stories about (Smartmatic) in order to benefit (Fox) Corp.’s financial interest.”', 'Smartmatic has “sufficiently alleged in their amended complaint that (Fox) Corp. employees played an affirmative role in the publication of the defamation at issue,” Cohen concluded.', 'The parent corporation had argued that it shouldn’t be involved in the defamation case because it only had general oversight of Fox News itself. Further, Fox Corp. argued there wasn’t proof that any corporate employees “directed” the allegedly defamatory statements to be aired.', 'Fox denies defaming anyone and claims that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment.', '“We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the ruling. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.”', 'Smartmatic sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021 for defamation and is seeking more than $2 billion in damages. A New York appeals court previously dismissed the case against Fox Corp. but gave Smartmatic a chance to refile the allegations with more evidence. Cohen said Wednesday that the refiled claims against Fox Corp. are sufficient enough to move forward.', '“We look forward to proceeding and holding Fox Corporation, as well as Fox News, responsible for the damage they did to Smartmatic,” the company’s lead attorney Erik Connolly said.', 'The case is still in the discovery phase, with some major depositions taking place in the past month, including former Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch.', 'The decision boosts Smartmatic’s case against the right-wing media behemoth. A similar 2020-related lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems was also allowed to proceed against Fox and its parent company. That case unearthed tranches of internal emails that described in devastating detail how top Fox officials cravenly allowed Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell to lie about the election on its shows.', 'The judge also on Wednesday gave Fox News a greenlight to continue its counterclaims against Smartmatic. The right-wing network is alleging that Smartmatic’s massive $2.7 billion request for damages is a legally baseless attempt to silence the network’s free-speech rights.', 'Fox filed its counterclaims against Smartmatic last year, in a bid to push back against the company and recover the money it’s spending on high-priced attorneys to defend itself.', '“(Fox’s) argument here is that (Smartmatic’s) alleged damages are so extenuated from their actual lost profits that they were pleaded and/or sought in order to chill (Fox’s) free speech rights. That argument has not yet been adjudicated in any court,” Cohen said, paving the way for Fox to continue its fight against the $2.7 billion figure.', 'Smartmatic had asked Cohen to dismiss the counterclaims, on the basis that of Fox’s arguments were already shut down in Dominion’s similar defamation case that the right-wing network settled last year, and that they shouldn’t be relitigated now.', 'In the Smartmatic case, Fox has previously argued that the Florida-based voting company couldn’t have lost billions of dollars due to the airing of election lies because it was already unprofitable and scandal-plagued before anyone accused the company of rigging votes against Trump.', '“While the recovery of fees and costs will not undo all the damage this First Amendment-defying lawsuit has wrought, at least it may cause the next plaintiff to think twice before trying to penalize the press to the tune of billions of dollars in non-existent damages for ensuring that the people can hear perspectives from all sides of the most pressing controversies of the day,” Fox wrote in a filing last year.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

On more traditional valuation measures, the current forward P/E ratio on the S&P 500 of 16.7x is below the recent peak of 22x; the current price/sales ratio of 2.3x is below the 1Q22 ratio of 3.0x; and the cur rent dividend yield of 1.6% is higher than the 1Q23 yield of 1.3%.

The good news is that Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) stock is doubling the broader market's returns so far this year. The bad news is that it's still January. There's not a lot that we can conclude just because the entertainment giant's shares are up by nearly 4% this young year against a 2% uptick for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)."", ""The ugly?

Finance.', 'The result of that underperformance is that Disney stock now trades at less than half the price it peaked at 35 months ago. It would have to more than double to hit a new all-time high -- but first things first. Disney needs to end its problematic streak of losing to the market.', 'It may seem incredible that the last time that Disney shares beat the market was in 2020, when the pandemic shuttered its theme parks, laid up its cruise ships, and limited its ability to crank out new theatrical releases. This year is also off to a turbulent start.', 'Disney is gearing up for a proxy battle at its annual shareholder meeting this spring. The character of Mickey Mouse has (somewhat) entered the public domain. Its movie studios have had to postpone at least three theatrical releases that the company had been counting on to premiere in 2024 as a result of the now-concluded Hollywood strikes.', 'However, getting lost in the noise are indicators that Disney is in better shape than many observers might think. Its money-draining streaming business remains on track to turn profitable by autumn. At least three theatrical releases slated for this year are from iconic franchises that have, historically, been box office gold. Management also recently raised its estimate of the annual cost savings it thinks it can achieve. Even the proxy battle could be a positive, if Disney embraces some of the better suggestions that activist investors are proposing.', ""The entertainment giant is also posting record revenue results. Pair those with its ugly stock chart over the last 35 months, and you see the shares trading at their lowest revenue multiple in years. The P/E ratio isn't as attractive, but that's being held back by losses at Disney+ and other inefficiencies that the bellwether media company is actively working to correct."", 'The stock trades for 22 times this fiscal year\'s projected earnings and 18 times next year\'s consensus earnings estimate. Those aren\'t quite the ""screaming bargain"" valuations that value investors crave, but Wall Street estimates for the company are inching higher, and in recent quarters, Disney has gotten back to consistently beating expectations.', ""The market isn't applauding Disney's recent moves. Its November launch of ESPN Bet -- which saw Disney partnering with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN) to roll out an online sportsbook -- was brilliant. That's a new revenue stream for Disney, and it's getting someone else to do the paddling. Chatter about Disney either unloading non-core assets or finding strategic partners to take minority stakes in some of its media networks should help turn market sentiment around."", ""Expectations are low this year. The analysts' consensus is that revenue will climb by less than 4% this fiscal year -- a low bar if the economy plays nice. The 14% increase on the bottom line that the market is modeling also seems low, given the rapidly improving financials for Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming operations."", ""It won't take much to awaken this giant. A hit movie here. A surprisingly robust report on theme park attendance there. A shower of pixie dust that ends with a promising divestiture or partnership that no one saw coming. There are a lot of ways for Disney to keep January's gains going. Disney shares are depressed because the market isn't impressed. Reshaping investor perspective is a tall order, but you're also talking about a master storyteller at work here, and I think Disney could change the narrative.

So Demchak wants his Pittsburgh-based bank to ""move into that next level"" and be known ""coast to coast as a ubiquitous standard brand.""', '""Scale matters,"" he added. ""We’re going to have to play that game.""', 'Demchak’s comments are stoking a new debate about the path forward for the nation’s biggest regional banks following the turmoil of 2023. Can they still thrive in that pocket between a colossus like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and thousands of tiny community banks, or do they need to consolidate and get much bigger to ensure their long-term survival?', 'Many of these banks are generally on more stable ground than they were during the first half of last year when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered panic about the strength of many other mid-sized financial institutions across the US.', 'Their stocks even surged late in 2023 as investors became more convinced the Federal Reserve was ready to start cutting sky-high interest rates as early as March. Such a move would help mid-sized banks that watched their profits plunge as deposits became more expensive.', 'Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards', 'But it is not yet clear when or if those cuts will happen, and bank stocks have fallen back at the start of 2024 as policymakers push back on market expectations for a loosening in the first quarter.', 'This uncertainty means regional banks will continue to struggle with a key profitability measure known as net interest income — which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay out on their deposits.', 'Income fell at many regional banks during the fourth quarter, and some said they expect it to fall during 2024 as well. That includes PNC, which said it expects net interest income to drop 5% this year.', 'But Demchak’s bigger concern is existential: He said last week that his bank needs to get bigger so it can exist in a category that would give PNC the ""quasi support that the giant banks have"" during times of crisis.', 'This was not the first time Demchak has made this point. He also did so in December while speaking at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in New York. When asked then if he would consider acquiring another bank, he said, ""Scale matters today more than it ever has.""', 'Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo decided to ask Demchak about this topic again last week during PNC’s fourth quarter earnings conference call, and Mayo summed up his reaction to the CEO’s survival-of-the-fittest guidance with one word: ""Wow.""', 'Demchak’s comments served as ""a very clear advertisement"" that PNC is looking to buy other banks over time, Mayo told Yahoo Finance.', '""I see this advertisement to buy targets as more of an announcement for the next three years, not the next three quarters,"" he added.', 'Not all of Demchak’s regional rivals agree with his view. ""I do not think scale is the answer for a bank like Key,"" KeyCorp (KEY) CEO Chris Gorman told analysts last week. Key is a regional bank based in Cleveland.', '""It\'s not something you have to have,"" added M&T Bank (MTB) CFO Daryl Bible. M&T is a Buffalo, N.Y.-based regional lender.', 'PNC has in the past used acquisitions to get bigger during times of industry-wide stress. During the 2008 financial crisis, it was encouraged by the US government to buy Cleveland rival National City for $5.2 billion, which basically doubled its size.', 'Demchak has since used more acquisitions over the last decade to establish a foothold in nearly every top metro area in the country. His last was a $11.6 billion deal for the US operations of Spanish banking giant BBVA that closed in 2021.

UAA have collaborated to develop NEOLAST, a revolutionary fiber set to redefine the landscape of performance stretch fabrics. This innovative material not only promises enhanced stretch performance but also addresses crucial sustainability challenges in the apparel industry, marking a significant step toward circular manufacturing.NEOLAST fibers are poised to be a game-changer, offering the sought-after qualities of elite performance fabrics, including powerful stretch, durability, comfort and improved moisture-wicking. What sets NEOLAST apart is its commitment to sustainability, challenging the conventional use of elastane, commonly known as spandex, in the production of stretch fabrics.The proprietary solvent-free, melt-extrusion process used in manufacturing NEOLAST fibers eliminates hazardous chemicals typically associated with elastane production. This not only enhances safety but also positions NEOLAST as a more environmentally friendly alternative. Furthermore, the fibers will be produced using recyclable elastoester polymers, addressing the challenge of recycling blended fabrics containing elastane.The collaboration between Celanese and Under Armour goes beyond product development. Together, they are exploring ways to improve the compatibility of stretch fabrics with future recycling systems and infrastructure. This forward-thinking approach aligns with the growing trend toward a circular economy, where end users can recycle performance stretch fabrics, closing the loop on a longstanding challenge in the industry.Celanese expressed optimism about the partnership, stating that it is proud to bring its polymer expertise and technical knowledge to help produce NEOLAST for textiles and fabrics. Under Armour echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the transformative nature of NEOLAST.Beyond sustainability benefits, NEOLAST offers increased production precision, allowing spinners to fine-tune power-stretch levels and engineer fibers to meet diverse fabric specifications. As Celanese explores applications with Under Armour, it also intends to make NEOLAST available to the broader apparel industry, potentially reducing dependence on traditional elastane.As the world strives for eco-friendly alternatives, NEOLAST stands at the forefront, revolutionizing not just stretch performance but also paving the way for a greener, circular approach to athletic apparel manufacturing.

With a commanding 17% market share in a fragmented industry, United Rentals Inc has expanded its fleet size to $21 billion, catering to a broad spectrum of customers across general industrial, commercial construction, and residential construction sectors. The financial tables within the filing indicate robust revenue growth, with a 19.3% year-over-year increase in rental revenue, including the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. Despite a highly leveraged balance sheet, with $11.5 billion in debt as of December 31, 2023, the company's strategic investments and operational efficiencies have positioned it for continued market dominance."", ""Market Leadership and Fleet Diversity: United Rentals Inc's market leadership is underpinned by its extensive and diverse rental fleet, which allows it to meet the substantial and varied equipment needs of large customers. This strength is evidenced by its estimated 15% North American market share as of December 31, 2023, which remained stable even after the inclusion of Ahern Rentals' pre-acquisition revenue. The company's fleet management strategy, which focuses on optimizing utilization levels and lifecycle management, has contributed to its ability to maintain a leading position in the market."", ""Strategic Acquisitions: The company's growth has been significantly bolstered by strategic acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Ahern Rentals. This acquisition has expanded United Rentals Inc's footprint and customer base, contributing to an 11.3% year-over-year increase in equipment rentals revenue on a pro forma basis. The ability to integrate and leverage new assets effectively demonstrates the company's strong management capabilities and strategic foresight."", ""Operational Efficiencies: United Rentals Inc has achieved operational efficiencies through the consolidation of common functions and the use of advanced information technology systems. These systems enable real-time monitoring of business activity, fleet sharing among branches, and improved customer service management. The company's Customer Care Center and proprietary software application, Total Control, exemplify its commitment to providing a superior standard of service and enhancing customer relationships."", ""High Debt Levels: One of the most significant weaknesses for United Rentals Inc is its substantial debt load, totaling $11.5 billion as of the end of 2023. This debt requires a considerable portion of the company's cash flow for service and could constrain its flexibility in responding to adverse business conditions. The need to manage credit risk and the potential inability to refinance under favorable terms are concerns that investors should monitor closely."", ""Cyclical Industry Risks: The company operates in a highly cyclical industry, with customer sectors like construction being particularly sensitive to economic downturns. Declines in construction or industrial activity could adversely impact revenues and profitability, especially since many of the company's costs are fixed. This cyclicality is a structural weakness that requires careful management and strategic planning to mitigate."", ""Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: United Rentals Inc's operations are subject to supply chain risks, including the availability of equipment and supplies from key vendors. Disruptions, insolvency, or financial difficulties among suppliers could impact the company's ability to meet customer demand and maintain its service standards. This weakness is exacerbated by the current global economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain constraints."", ""Infrastructure Spending: The company is well-positioned to benefit from government spending on infrastructure projects. With its extensive fleet and national reach, United Rentals Inc can capitalize on increased construction activity associated with such investments. The company's ability to support large-scale projects is a significant opportunity for growth, particularly in light of recent trends toward increased infrastructure investment."", ""Digital Transformation: United Rentals Inc has the opportunity to further enhance its digital capabilities, which can lead to improved operational efficiencies and customer engagement. The company's Total Control platform and mobile applications are examples of how technology can be leveraged to provide better service and manage business operations more effectively. Continued investment in digital transformation initiatives could provide a competitive advantage and drive future growth."", ""Market Share Expansion: Despite its already significant market share, there is room for United Rentals Inc to expand further, particularly by targeting underserved regions or customer segments. The company's strong brand recognition and diverse fleet provide a foundation for capturing additional market share, either organically or through additional strategic acquisitions."", ""Economic and Industry Downturns: The equipment rental industry's fortunes are closely tied to the health of the broader economy, particularly the construction sector. Economic downturns, increased interest rates, or declines in industrial activity pose threats to United Rentals Inc's revenue and profitability. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to navigate these potential headwinds."", 'Competitive Pressures: As the market leader, United Rentals Inc faces constant pressure from existing and new competitors.

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. The equipment and intangible asset items are included in cash flows from investing activities. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the restructuring charges, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities. Used equipment sales adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the fair value mark-up of fleet acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold (this adjustment is explained further in the adjusted EPS and EBITDA/adjusted EBITDA tables below). The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability; and (iv) used equipment sales adjusted gross margin provides information that is useful for evaluating the profitability of used equipment sales without regard to potential distortions.

See the tables below for further discussion of these non-GAAP measures.', 'Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes.

The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.', 'About United Rentals', 'United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

The market has handsomely rewarded Nvidia for its eye-popping growth, with its shares rising 222% in the past year. The good part is that Nvidia seems capable of sustaining its impressive rally thanks to the growing demand for AI chips deployed in servers and other applications."", ""This explains why KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh recently raised his Nvidia price target to $740 from $650. The upgraded price target points toward a 30% upside from current levels. However, Nvidia wasn't the only chip stock to receive a price target bump from KeyBanc. The firm expects two more chipmakers, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) to benefit from AI adoption."", ""Let's look at the reasons why KeyBanc has upgraded these semiconductor stocks, which look like no-brainer buys right now."", ""Vinh has increased his price target on AMD from $170 to $195, which points toward 19% gains from current levels. The analyst pointed out that recent supply chain checks found that the demand for AMD's server processors and the newly launched AI-focused accelerators was strong. According to Vinh, AMD's MI300 family of AI accelerators could generate $8 billion in revenue in 2024, a significant jump from the earlier estimate of $3 billion to $4 billion."", ""It is not hard to see why KeyBanc has substantially raised its estimate for AMD's AI chip sales this year. The chipmaker has been aggressively looking to bolster its supply chain so that it can make a dent in the AI chip market. AMD's foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, is predicted to increase its packaging capacity of advanced chips by 20% in 2024 to 35,000 wafers per month."", ""That would be way higher than the earlier estimates, which put TSMC's monthly advanced chip packaging capacity for 2024 in a range of 14,000 to 16,000 wafers. As a result, AMD should be able to ship a much larger number of AI chips in 2024 considering that it is among TSMC's top customers. Assuming AMD does manage to achieve $8 billion in revenue from AI chip sales, it would easily outpace its current expectation of generating just $2 billion in sales from this market."", ""This could eventually help AMD deliver stronger-than-expected growth in 2024. Analysts are currently anticipating AMD's revenue to increase almost 18% this year to $26.7 billion, followed by a 16% increase in 2025."", 'However, as the above chart shows, analysts have substantially raised their revenue growth expectations for AMD. The latest supply chain checks carried out by KeyBanc suggest that those estimates could move higher as the year progresses and AMD gets more revenue from selling AI chips.', ""For instance, if AMD can indeed get $8 billion in revenue from AI chip sales in 2024 as compared to its original estimate of $2 billion, that additional $6 billion in revenue could help it achieve nearly $33 billion in revenue this year. Based on AMD's current price-to-sales ratio of 11.7, a $33 billion top line could send its market capitalization to $386 billion in a year."", ""That would be a 47% jump from current levels, though don't be surprised to see AMD stock delivering a bigger upside as the market could reward it with a higher sales multiple. Nvidia, for example, has a price-to-sales ratio of over 31. AMD, therefore, is significantly cheaper right now. But that may not be the case for long considering the improving prospects of its AI business."", 'KeyBanc increased its price target on Micron Technology stock to $115 from $100, which would be an impressive 35% jump from the current price. The reason behind this price target upgrade is the lucrative opportunity for Micron in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip market.', 'The demand for HBM is increasing rapidly as it is deployed in AI servers, which are being rolled out rapidly to train large language models (LLMs). According to Foxconn, the AI server market could grow fivefold by 2027, which should positively impact HBM demand as well. Market research firm Gartner predicts that HBM demand could increase eightfold over the next four years because of its ability to provide high data bandwidth, a larger capacity, and reduce power consumption at the same time -- three factors that play a critical role in training LLMs.', ""KeyBanc's supply chain checks have revealed that Micron is all set to ride the HBM wave with some help from Nvidia. The memory specialist is expected to command 70% HBM share in Nvidia's upcoming B100 data center graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia's B100 GPU is expected to be manufactured using a more advanced 3 nanometer (nm) process as compared to the 5nm process on which the H100 is based."", ""The new Nvidia chip is expected to be significantly more powerful. A smaller process node means that chips made on it should ideally carry more computing power and reduce power consumption. So, it won't be surprising to see this AI chip witness solid customer demand, and that could eventually help Micron ship more units of its HBM."", ""Moreover, Micron confirmed on its December earnings conference call that its HBM was in the final stages of qualification for multiple Nvidia AI chips. All this explains why the company's top-line growth is set to take off from the current fiscal year, jumping to $22.6 billion from just $15.5 billion in fiscal 2023."", ""Also, as the chart above indicates, Micron's revenue estimates have been raised of late, and the trend could continue as AI-driven adoption of memory increases."", ""With Micron stock currently trading at 5.7 times sales, which is in line with its five-year average sales multiple, investors are getting a good deal on the stock considering the potential growth it is anticipated to deliver. Assuming a similar multiple after two years and $32 billion in revenue, as the chart above indicates, Micron's market cap could hit $182 billion."", 'That would be 95% higher than its current market cap. Investors, therefore, should not miss the opportunity to buy Micron while it trades at a significantly cheaper valuation than Nvidia as it could deliver tremendous upside thanks to AI.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

As always, following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions."", ""I'll now turn the call over to Dave for his opening remarks."", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Shanye, and hello, everyone. I am going to focus on two key topics in my remarks today. First, we delivered solid fiscal second-quarter results with revenue at the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP earnings of $0.12 per share, exceeding the upper end of our guided range. And second, last week, we marked a major inflection point in mass capacity storage with the launch of our groundbreaking Mosaic platform.', ""Mosaic is intentionally named to describe the fusion of innovative technologies including Seagate's unique implementation of HAMR that collectively enabled us to extend our aerial density leadership. As we shared in the past, growing aerial density is the most efficient way to enable data center operators to scale mass capacity storage to lower their TCO and to advance their sustainability targets. I'll discuss the platform in more detail shortly and also share progress toward qualification and volume ramp of our first HAMR-based Mosaic product. which lays the foundation for products posting five terabytes per disc and beyond."", 'Let me start by highlighting our fiscal Q2 performance. Revenue of $1.56 billion was led by sequentially improving cloud nearline demand and a seasonal uptick in consumer drives, offset partially by the decline in VIA sales that we anticipated. Strong cost discipline and execution on pricing adjustments resulted in non-GAAP operating income tripling quarter over quarter and increasing roughly 17% year over year despite lower revenue levels. These performance and demand trends affirm our expectation for the September quarter to be the bottom of this prolonged down cycle.', ""The enhanced discipline we've built into the business, including strict cost controls, management of supply, and the strengthening of our balance sheet gives us an excellent foundation to build on as we move into a broader recovery. Additionally, execution of our product road map is expected to structurally improve profitability and return us to our targeted financial model, which supports healthier industry economics. We enter calendar 2024 with increased confidence in our non-GAAP gross margin trajectory, including our ability to reclaim 30% minimum benchmark level at quarterly revenues that are at least 20% below our prior cyclical peak. From a demand standpoint, gradual recovery within the U.S."", 'cloud market has started to take shape, reflecting solid progress in consuming excess inventory, along with more stable end-market behavior. Enterprise OEM demand trends have also stabilized within the U.S. markets. Customer feedback still points to macro-related concerns, although IT hardware budgets are projected to modestly improve in calendar 2024, and traditional server growth is expected to resume trends that support incremental HDD demand growth in the calendar year.', ""We were also encouraged to see incremental demand among certain non-U.S. cloud and enterprise customers in the December quarter. Across the broader China markets, we project a relatively slower pace of recovery given the ongoing economic challenges within the region. However, some local governments announced further steps to support the region's economy, which our customers believe will bolster local demand across mass capacity markets in China in the second half of the calendar year."", ""These efforts support our view for demand in the VIA markets to pick up sometime after the Lunar New Year. Against the dynamic market environment, Seagate has continued to execute on a mass-capacity product portfolio that further advances our technology leadership and serves the breadth of our customers' unique workload requirements while also supporting our objective of improving profitability. I'll outline the execution path for our latest product launches and the relevance of the new platform and then share how we believe our mass capacity solutions deliver economic value both to our customers and to Seagate. Our product qualification and ramp plans are on track with what we've been articulating over the past several quarters."", 'We began shipping initial volumes of our 24-terabyte PMR, 28-terabyte SMR drives in the December quarter. Customer reception has been positive, as illustrated by the numerous active qualifications underway across multiple cloud and enterprise customers. Our three-plus terabyte per disk product is the first major release of the HAMR-based Mozaic platform and we are rapidly nearing qual completion with our initial hyperscale launch partner. The qual has gone very well, and we are working with this customer at their request to fully transition future Seagate demand to the three-plus terabyte per disk platform.', 'Volume ramp is starting in the March quarter according to plan with a goal to ship about 1 million units in the first half of this calendar year. We then expect to continue to ramp through the balance of the calendar year, and we are currently broadening our customer engagements. Based on their planned timelines, we expect to complete qualifications with a majority of U.S. hyperscalers and a couple of global cloud customers during calendar 2024.', ""Starting at three terabytes per disk, Mozaic delivers a quantum leap forward in aerial density innovation with a well-defined path that extends to five terabytes per disc and beyond. This transformative platform is the culmination of decades of development and numerous technologies pioneered by Seagate, including our superlattice platinum alloy media that enables higher bit density. The revolutionary plasmonic writer with integrated laser capable of reliability writing each bit and an advanced reader technology to post one of the world's smallest reading sensors. While Mozaic represents groundbreaking technology, the platform is fully plug-and-play with existing conventional drives and addresses the breadth of our customers' mass capacity workloads."", 'These drives can also be deployed with SMR technologies for the few customers able to integrate SMR to take advantage of the additional capacity gains. As I noted earlier, aerial density gains are the most efficient way to scale storage capacity. Let me offer a few clear examples. First, as we execute our product road map, we can deliver increasingly higher capacity drives with minimal changes to the bill of materials.', 'This results in a better TCO value proposition for our customers and attractive economics for Seagate. Second, as we scale aerial density to four terabytes per disk, this enables extremely cost-effective product offerings in the low to midrange capacity points used by a majority of our enterprise [Inaudible ] customers. With four terabytes per disk, we used half the number of heads and disks to produce a 20-terabyte drive. Prototypes are already working in our labs with revenue planned for the second half of calendar 2025.', 'As we ramp production to expand to other end markets, we gained tremendous manufacturing efficiencies, adding to the attractive margin opportunities that I just described. We continue to build on our technology and operational innovations with each successive product generation. For example, we are executing plans to vertically integrate the laser manufacturing process, which enhances supply flexibility, provides greater control of the technology, and provides opportunities to lower production costs. Collectively, we believe these actions underpin our mass capacity cost reduction road map while also providing a very strong TCO story for a broad range of customers.', 'While TCO remains a key driver for mass capacity storage, data center operators are also focused on power and space consumption, particularly as investments in compute-intensive infrastructure proliferates to support generative AI applications. For context, the latest AI GPUs consume up to 700 watts, which is roughly 100x more power intensive than a hard drive operating at maximum performance. Our products can help data center operators store more exabytes using less power and space. To quantify this, a single 32-terabyte Mozaic drive can replace 310-terabyte drives storing more capacity at one-third of the power and footprint.', ""TCO and sustainability gains of this magnitude are decision-altering when architecting a new data center and offer a highly economical path to modernizing existing infrastructure. We believe that this dynamic can potentially accelerate the replacement cycle. As we move into the early stages of demand recovery, Seagate's strong focus on maintaining our product and technology road map through this past down cycle position us to return to profitable growth and address data center operators most important challenges cost, power, and space. We believe we've got the right product at the right time, heading into a gradual recovering mass capacity market."", 'With that, Gianluca will now cover details on our financial performance and outlook.', 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Dave. Seagate's December quarter financial results reflect solid operational execution. Revenue was $1.56 billion, up 7% quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP operating income more than tripled sequentially to $127 million, leading to non-GAAP operating margin expanding to 8.2% of revenue, up 540 basis points quarter over quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.12, improving $0.34 sequentially and exceeding the high end of our original guidance range, reflecting both improving demand trends and our focus on profitability."", 'As these trends continue, we expect our results to improve and reach the target financial model over time. Within our hard disk drive business, exabyte shipments grew 6% sequentially to 95, with revenue growing 7% to $1.4 billion. Revenue performance was mainly driven by an expected improvement in cloud customer demand, along with seasonal improvement in the consumer market. Within the mass capacity market, revenue increased 4% sequentially to $1.1 billion, driven mainly by strong nearline cloud demand, offsetting the expected decline in the VIA market.', 'Mass capacity shipments totaled 83 exabytes compared with 79 exabytes in the September quarter. Mass capacity shipments as a percent of total HDD exabyte was 87%, which is comparable to the prior quarter 88%. For nearline products, shipment of 65 exabytes were up quarter over quarter from 56 exabytes. Average capacity per nearline drive continue to increase sequentially, reflecting modest demand improvement among both U.S.', 'cloud customer and China cloud customers. We believe that inventory among many CSP customers is reaching more normalized levels and anticipate continued nearline demand improvement in the March quarter and beyond. VIA market revenue was down sequentially in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations. Looking ahead, we expect VIA to reflect more typical seasonal patterns through calendar 2024, with the March quarter representing the low point.', 'Legacy product revenue was $324 million, up from $278 million in the prior quarter, driven by higher seasonal demand in the consumer market. We expect the legacy market to be sequentially lower in the March quarter following typical consumer demand trends post holiday season. Finally, revenue for our non-HDD business increased to $171 million compared with $159 million last quarter, primarily driven by improved SSD demand. Moving on to the rest of the income statement.', 'Non-GAAP gross profit increased sequentially by roughly $80 million in the December quarter to $367 million, ahead of our original expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin of 23.6% expanded nearly 400 basis points compared to the previous quarter due in part to pricing adjustment and cost savings from earlier restructuring activities as well as lower amortization costs, which were about $40 million consistent with our view for ongoing demand recovery. However, we expect underutilization cost to margin increase for the next couple of quarters as we transition some of our production line to Mozaic. Accounting for this headwind, we still expect to see margin expansion every quarter in calendar 2024 as nearline demand continues to improve gradually and we ramp our latest products along with continued execution of price adjustment across the entire portfolio.', 'Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $240 million, down from $248 million in the September quarter and reflecting ongoing spending optimization. With the benefit of diligent expense management and higher margins, adjusted EBITDA improved more than 50% sequentially to $216 million. Non-GAAP net income turned positive in the December quarter, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share based on diluted share count of approximately 211 million shares and tax expense of $17 million. Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.', ""In the December quarter, we had the inventory flat at just below $1.1 billion. Capital expenditure were also flat sequentially at $70 million. A majority of planned capital expenditure were completed in the first half of fiscal '24. Consistent with prior commentary, we still expect fiscal '24 capex to be down significantly compared with fiscal '23, also still sufficient to support our innovation-driven product road map."", 'We generated about $100 million in free cash flow and returned $146 million to shareholders through the quarterly dividend, exiting the quarter with 210 million shares outstanding. We closed the December quarter with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including our undrawn revolving credit facility. Our debt balance was $5.7 billion at the end of December quarter, with more than 90% of our long-term debt obligation beyond three years. Non-GAAP interest expense were flat quarter over quarter at $84 million, and we project similar expense levels in the March quarter.', 'Turning to our outlook. We expect incremental improvements in mass capacity demand from both cloud and enterprise customers to more than offset seasonal-related decline in VIA and the legacy markets. With better context, March quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.65 billion, plus or minus $150 million. an increase of 6% sequentially at the midpoint.', 'We are planning for non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $260 million as our temporary pay reduction ended late in the December quarter. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand to the low double-digit percentage range including underutilization cost of approximately $50 million. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be $0.25, plus or minus $0.20, based on a diluted share count of approximately 212 million shares and a non-GAAP tax expense of $27 million. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Gianluca. Heading into calendar 2024, we have increased confidence in a gradual nearline demand recovery that coincides with the launch of Mozaic. We believe this platform delivers sustainable aerial density leadership with compelling TCO advantages, enabling data center operators to satisfy their increasing workload demands while conserving both power and space. This combination of capabilities is significant, and our timing is fortuitous.', ""We've navigated the last seven quarters with discipline and focus while maintaining our product and technology execution plans. As a result, we emerge well-positioned to drive optimized financial performance to support our capital return commitments and return to our targeted profitability levels over time. Our strong execution is only possible through the tremendous efforts of our global team, and I would like to thank them for their resiliency and dedication through this dynamic period. I would also like to thank our suppliers, customers, and shareholders for your ongoing support of Seagate."", ""Operator, let's open up the call for questions."", '', 'Operator', ""Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And today's first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with BofA."", 'Please go ahead.', 'Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thank you so much. Dave, you alluded to the progress that you've made on Mozaic. Given what you know now, how would you characterize the outlook for maybe HAMR units in the second half of '24 or perhaps into '25? And I think you mentioned your first customer looking to transition to three-terabyte HAMR. What kind of exabyte installed base opportunity is that? And maybe you could address it even more broadly across hyperscalers."", 'That would be very helpful. Thank you.', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. So, we were very quantitative and prescriptive on the last call about the front half of this year. I think we won't be as much on the back half of this year, but the ramp is continuing on at a healthy pace."", ""And we're continuing to look at all what customers need on the last-generation platform, next-generation platform, trying to balance supply and demand really well. I think that's the primary metric that we're focused on, make sure we get financial predictability. We'll drive the HAMR transition aggressively this year. And then Mozaic really gets into -- when we get to four terabytes of platter and how are we populating that chain, I mean, we expect to drive as many HAMR exabytes into 2025 as we can."", ""So, we're off to a good start, I think, and we're going up the ramp and trying to work the yields and get everybody qualified like we talked about. Nothing really changed in the last 90 days, I would say, problems are tough problems, but the team is knocking them down. So, I'm pretty happy with that."", 'Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you for that. Gianluca, and maybe could you help us just think about the margin ramp? I think you noted some headwinds that will continue from underutilization charges, but you're also expecting the margins to increase all through calendar '24. Could you maybe also help us think through in that margin commentary, what the margin differential is between HAMR and CMR mass capacity drives and how that might change over time? Thank you so much."", 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Good question. Well, first of all, our December quarter showed a good improvement in profitability. Our gross margin was up about 4%.', ""Operating margin was up more than 5%, so I'll say this profitability recovery already started. Part of that is, of course, coming from a cost actions that we have taken in the last almost two years. And of course, the mix improvement and of course, the pricing action also that we have taken in the last several quarters. So, this will continue to be reflected also in the future quarters."", 'Mix will continue to go through more mass capacity volume and those cost actions are, of course, continuing to be very effective. In terms of the underutilization defend a little bit what we ramped during the quarter. In the December quarter, we ran a bit more of the wafers, but of course, has high cost in our manufacturing to get ready for the achievement of the current quarter and next quarter in terms of HAMR. And then now we can mediate use it to be the wafer and trend more on the media and, of course, having more driving the final test.', 'So, depending on the base of the mix inside our production. So, we said underutilization charges could be slightly higher, a little bit higher, but not very much higher, which is a little bit higher. So, I expect that for the next few quarters to see mix going in the right direction, meaning more high-capacity drive, and starting to see the impact from some volume of HAMR. So, March will not be particularly high-volume, but we will have more in June.', 'And as Dave said, we will have even more into the second part of the calendar year. With the business improving, demand improving, we go into possibly higher revenue, and we are, of course, targeting to bring back our gross margin into the target range of 30% to 33%, as we said in the prior quarter, at a much lower level of revenue compared to the prior upside.', 'Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dave, I was wondering if you could just double-click again on some of the dynamics behind the hyperscalers and where their inventory is. How long do you see any more pain or what their behavior is, what your conversations look like? And then again, how they're responding to any pricing actions and production changes that you've been making over the last -- relative to 90 days ago? Thank you."", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. The dynamics for them is very interesting, and it has affected us quite a bit over the last year or so I do think the inventory situation is much, much better than it was six months ago. So, I'll say, it's basically cleaned up at this point. And it's going into the inventory changes going out and being consumed by the data centers again."", ""So, we're much happier with that. The rate of consumption isn't what it was two years ago. But I do think it's going to accelerate a little bit. And this is where we get into the forecast numbers of what the CAGR is the exabyte CAGR."", ""In 2020, we were in the high 50s and then we stayed in the 30s for 2021 and 2022. And then for the first time ever for the last year, year and a half, we've seen negative exabyte growth, which doesn't make any sense. We're forecasting still in the mid-20s right now. And it may be a little bit higher as people get into some of these replacement cycles that we talked about."", ""The interesting dynamic as I look back on the last year and a half was the push for AI and how it consumed a lot of compute dollars for the compute infrastructure that was going on in the data centers. And that's critical for most of our customers. They have been raised up to get as much compute memory for that compute online as they could to be able to handle all these AI applications everyone's talking about. I do think ultimately, there's a data back-end piece of that."", ""And then also, there's the fact that they were -- as they were prioritizing that, they were letting the drives that they had in the data centers just continue to run. So, there's the replacement cycle for power and space and just overall cost benefits. We're all -- we're definitely having those conversations with our customers. And then factoring that into what exactly our volume plans are for the next three years and saying this is what we're intending to build."", ""This is the economics that you could get it to -- and we've talked about this build-to-order before, and I think we're getting a lot of good reception is. There's a lot of other supply chains that are actually managed this way by these people. So, they understand it fairly well, and they see the TCO benefits of the higher capacity drives, so they want to reach for that, plan it well and they'll get it. And we have to be careful, of course, because the factories have been so decimated by this downturn that we need to make sure that as we grow back, we go back in a smart way."", 'Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Super. Thanks so much, guys.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to maybe just ask about the income statement, just the P&L trajectory from here. This guidance that you've given, looks like it's the first kind of sequential increase in opex that we've seen, and I can appreciate improving fundamentals, etc."", ""I'm just curious, how do we think about the pace of quarterly opex and maybe a normalized level of operating expenses looking out over a couple of quarters? And then kind of building off of that with free cash flow generation returning -- just remind us again how you think about the capital structure and possibility of coming back into the market in terms of share repo? Thank you."", 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Aaron. Well, in terms of opex, if you look at -- our trend has always been very positive in terms of opex control, cost control. Just a few quarters ago, we were at well above $300 million. So, we went fairly low, especially in the last quarter, now at $240 million.', ""As I said in the prepared remarks, we have a little bit of higher costs expected in this quarter because we took some extraordinary action on salary that ended at the end of last quarter. So, we have a little bit of higher labor cost. As usual, we will focus on opex control is still a very, very good number. And I think in the next few quarters, we will stay around this level of opex until next fiscal year, as you know, in the current fiscal year, we don't have any variable compensation overall in our COGS and opex, but a big part is in opex."", 'So, I think this level is probably reasonable for fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. And then next fiscal year, probably a little bit higher cost in opex. Still, I think well below the $300 million, probably between $270 million to $80 million a quarter is probably a reasonable way to model it. Free cash flow, we had another positive free cash flow quarter.', 'Of course, always very important for us to generate positive free cash flow. Revenue is increasing, profitability is increasing and therefore, we expect free cash flow also to improve sequentially through the next few quarters.', 'Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Unknown speaker', ""Hey, guys. This is Eddie for Krish. Congrats on the HAMR launch. It's an exciting opportunity for you guys I have a question regarding the customer value you are providing with these two-terabyte HAMR drives."", ""Will customers be enjoying lower price for terabyte versus 22 and 24 terabytes CMR drives, for example, or because HAMR yields haven't matured yet, this benefit will be more about power and space and the lower price per terabyte to take place in the future?"", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Well, it's a good question. We will balance everything, of course, what our yields are and our costs are, and try to get the customers incentivized, but there is some incentive business provided by their power and space reductions as well. We call that their TCO proposition."", ""So, all things in balance. I do think that the price per terabyte, if you will, is nominally the same. It may be just slightly lower, but there's definitely going to be a TCO incentive for the customers to move off of the lower capacities and onto higher."", 'Unknown speaker', ""That's great color. Thanks, Dave. And if we just suppose the HAMR transition to the transition from LMR to PMR that took place back in 2006, 2008 you guys went from like 0% PMR mix to 100% within five to six scores. Do you think the HAMR transition will be as quick, or you see some reasons why this ramp may be a little bit slower transition from LMR to PMR back then?"", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Cycle times are a little bit longer now. So, I don't think it will be as fast. I mean, I'd like it to be as fast and we'll continue to drive it as quick as we possibly can. The one thing I will say is that our last generation PMR product, if you will, the 2.4 terabytes per platter drive that we've just talked about has a remarkably similar kit of parts as the HAMR drives do."", ""So, relative to what we're making one versus the other, it's not a big deal and we can get through customer transitions easier. I think as we gain more confidence in a year over the four-plus terabyte Mozaic platforms, then we'll definitely want to accelerate. Because by the time you get to say, five-plus terabytes, then it's such a great replacement on every legacy product that you have that we want to drive the whole portfolio there because utilization is much better in the factories and the costs come way down."", 'Unknown speaker', 'Thank you, Dave.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. And our next question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead."", 'Thomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. So, I just wanted to understand the move from qualification to revenue recognition.', ""It sounds like with your largest customer, you're finishing qualification right now and you're obviously pointing to some big units in the first half. You mentioned on the call that you're expecting calls with the majority of the U.S. cloud and a couple of others in calendar year '24. Would you expect a similar time frame between qualification and revenue recognition? Like if those are getting qualified in the second half of this year, you could see revenue from a large number of additional customers."", 'Just wanted to understand the timing.', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Tom. It's complex. There are some customers that are relatively shorter qualifications and that -- some of that's because of feature set, making sure we get the feature set checked out. If they're on a generic feature set that we're already shipping versus their own unique feature set we have to -- we have to make sure we're doing all those things, right? That's normal in any nearline transition."", ""And I will say that a lot of people are seeing the TCO benefits. So, they're asking and trying to speed these qualifications through, right, because they want that benefit to flow through as well. We will also be limited on our ramp as to what we can do, and the cycle times are quite long. So, we're going to balance all these things together, if that helps you."", 'Thomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Yeah, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask one on the margin side. So, you guys have talked about 20% below peak but still getting back to that 30% gross margin target or at least at the low end. If you look at what you're saying for mass capacity growth for the industry, mid-20s if you just assigned that to kind of your revenue ramp over the next couple of years, it takes probably a year and a half to kind of get to that $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion mark, just using like a linear growth rate."", 'Is that the time frame we should be thinking about until you get back to that 30% to 32% gross margin? Or can you get there before? And what are the levers that get you there before revenue gets back to that $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion? Thank you.', 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Tom. Well, the major lever is HAMR. The more we ramp up HAMR, better will be the margin. So, we are becoming more and more positive on, of course, the timing of that continuous improvement in our margin.', ""I would say we gave an indication last quarter in terms of the level of revenue. But we think we need to achieve in order to get a certain level of gross margin. That is probably I'm getting a little bit more optimistic right now. So, probably we can do an even lower level of revenue."", ""As you said before, qualification of customers is important, but we are working hard on qualifying more and more customers. So, assuming we can continue our ramp on him. Now, I'm fairly positive we can do earlier than what you said and also at the lower level of revenue."", 'Thomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.', 'Karl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Gianluca, it's encouraging to see an improving gross margin trajectory, but it doesn't appear to be driven by price yet. Given our mass capacity suggests that price per terabyte did fall low single digits sequentially and year over year. Could you perhaps address whether we should expect previous actions to raise prices across the channel may occur over the next couple of quarters? I have a follow-up, please."", 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Karl. Well, I would say you can see the good improvement in our profitability. A good part of that is actually coming from pricing. Of course, you need to check into the like-for-like pricing.', 'The mix has, of course, always a major impact on the average. We are very happy with what we are doing, both on pricing and on cost. This quarter show a fantastic improvement in profitability, both gross margin and operating margin. And if you look at our guidance, this imply another strong improvement in profitability.', 'So, Pricing is a good part of that. Mix is another part of that improvement. And we will continue to do exactly execute a strategy, and we are really we are very glad with the outcome so far.', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I would say, Karl, the raw demand is still not what it was two years ago. And we have a supply chain that's not entirely healthy yet. We have to go continue to work on those actions."", ""But I do think over time, especially incentivizing transitions to newer mass capacity drives. And then if there's price raises, it tends to be more on legacy and to the extent that everyone is under the same strain throughout the entire ecosystem, this is the trend that we're seeing, I think we'll probably take advantage of it. My sense is that in the next year or two, we'll get to the point where we get high enough of the ramp that we can be very predictable. And then I think things will stabilize quite a bit."", ""But we're not at a place where the industry has enough demand relative to the capacity that has online yet."", 'Karl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', ""Very clear. That's it for me. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results. You implemented a build-to-order program with your customers. Can you give an update on that? Is that still active? And how is it giving you visibility?', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks very much. It is, and it's transitioned from my last comments as well because the industry just at the levels that we're at, to build on my last comment is just can't fund the investment disease make an aerial density and exabyte growth over time with the revenue and margins where it was and what helps us is to run factories is the improved visibility and the predictability toward that in demand. And so, I think that's why the HDD industry has changed fairly dramatically through this cycle, the last six or eight quarters because capacity did come at the same time that people were that demand was down."", ""And the industry is, therefore, underinvested in capital, and lead times are going up, as we've talked about before. So, we need this build-to-order framework to just get back to a healthy industry. And we are rewarding predictability with our customers, and we're incentivizing that predictability and where the people aren't predictable, and they come in at the last minute for product that either we don't have it or they have to pay for our flexibility. I think that's the way we're thinking about it and then making sure that we stabilize the supply base as well because it's not just ourselves as the HDD supplier, but we have numerous upstream supplies that need to be stabilized as well."", ""So, it's still going to take some time."", 'Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. And you mentioned vertical integration of your laser technology. Is that a cost savings? Or is it more controlling the supply chain?', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I think at this point, it's been a long time coming, and we definitely value the suppliers that have helped us get HAMR products to market. We also feel like given how intricate this silicon photonic circuitry is, is that we needed our own capability to control but right now, it's more of a technology second sourcing, if you will. And so, we're going to continue to run with a few sources."", ""I think over time, there should be the opportunity to go drive the cost down and balance all things with multiple sources and the ability to control the investments that we make in capital, for example, and things like that. But it's been a long time coming and part of the reason we're talking about it as part of Mozaic because it's very relevant as we get the four-terabyte platter and five-terabyte platter I think also there's been some noise out there in the industry about, well, as goes the ramp of that supplier so goes the Seagate ramp, and that's clearly not true."", 'Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst', 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Steven Bryant Fox with Fox Advisors, LLC. Please go ahead.', 'Steven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst', ""Thanks for taking my question. Dave, I was just wondering if you could zoom out a little bit without putting any kind of time frame on it, to get to the 30% gross margins, it seems like you can almost get there from here on just the typical incremental margins from volumes. But based on everything you said, it doesn't seem that easy, especially early stage with HAMR versus later stage. So, can you sort of walk through some of the puts and takes, say, over the next two to three quarters versus, say, when you hit that volume crossover where it becomes more smooth to get to the margin? It's just -- there's been a lot of comments around this."", 'Maybe you could just sum it up.', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. And Gianluca can share some insights as well here. I think that, first of all, we're ramping HAMR according to some prescriptive schedule. We can deploy it into certain mass-capacity hyperscaler markets."", 'We can also deploy it in other markets, depending on how we choose to do things so we can put it in VIA markets, for example, over time. And the rate at which we are able to transition and our yields and scrap and things like that, especially once we get to four terabytes per platter, then I think that becomes more and more accretive in margin. Fundamentally, though, I still think the demand picture actually is going to shape the next few quarters from a margin perspective. My sense is the demand has still not come anywhere close to where it was two years ago.', 'We may see with the growth of data and with investments that people need to make in data around all these AI applications, we may see demand pick back up again, and that will be the fundamental driver. Gianluca, go ahead.', 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. No, I said that before. I think the combination of stronger demand through the cycle and our very good products based on HAMR technology. will drive further improvement in gross margin, sequential improvement.', ""Now, I think we will have a sequential improvement through the entire kind of '24. And this is, of course, based on our view of the ramp of HAMR and also the recovery from the prior down cycle that we expect, especially in the mass capacity to continue through the entire kind of '24 and actually even kind of '25 in it."", 'Steven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst', ""That's helpful. Can you fill in one other blank, which is back-end testing capacity? How does that sort of help hurt margins as this ramp happens? Thanks."", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Based on where we were from legacy products years ago on desktop and so on and even just the volumes we were at a couple of years ago, I think we have plenty of back-end test capacity.', 'Steven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst', ""But is it a longer test cycle, though? Isn't it a longer test cycle?"", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', 'It is. It certainly is. The bigger the drive, the longer the test cycle, but we still have plenty of capacity to cover the demands at this level.', 'Steven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst', 'Awesome. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.', 'Unknown speaker', ""This is Maia on for Tim. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. Now, you don't report orders, but perhaps you could give us some color on book-to-bill and just some idea of where orders are relative to revenues and where that -- how that book-to-bill has been trending and where you think that's going over the next couple of quarters, that would be helpful."", 'Thanks.', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. That does get into our build-to-order plans. We are definitely, like I said before, very prescriptive on what we're building for people two, three, four quarters out. And as long as we all stay on that plan, I think that's predictable economics for our customers as well."", ""So, it's going better and better every quarter. I think when we first launched this, there was questions that I was getting on these earnings calls about supply is so far below or sorry, since demand is so far below supply today, how can you do something like this, but we need that predictability in order to run the supply chain and reward everyone upstream of the supply chain. So, far, the progress has been fairly good, and we're getting better visibility in the next quarter and beyond."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.', 'Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Dave, just on the enterprise hard disk drive side on the hardest asset, do you see, given the 25% exabyte growth and recovery on the TC side this year, do you expect those revenues to get back to that $2 billion run rate exiting '24, I guess, calendar '24?"", 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""No, we don't guide after this quarter. So, we just gave a good guidance for the March quarter in terms of revenue increase and profitability increase. And as we said, no, we are ramping here volume. We are seeing better demand environment."", ""So, we expect sequential improvement through the quarter, but we don't give specific guidance on revenue for the end of the calendar year."", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I would say that, obviously, we're watching nearline demand, CSP demand, on-prem enterprise demand continuing to build strength but not nearly be as big as it was a couple of years ago, but that's very good, and we're being very careful building into it. The one point that you just raised, which was the whole AI TPC demand, which I think it's still very early innings in this, but we do see opportunity there. high-end workstations, if you will, that are running AI applications may actually be an interesting opportunity."", 'Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it. And then on the gross margin line, sorry to belabor that, do you see you guys getting back to that target window 33% exiting this year? And especially on the HAMR side, I think Dave mentioned you can do with four-terabyte plus five disks or a 20-terabyte drive versus seven to 10 disks now. What are the gross margins on HAMR versus where you see your corporate margins today, I guess?', 'Gianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. We know we said in the past amortized gross margin is, for sure, accretive to the corporation. So, it's always above our average. Right now, as you know, there is no HAMR drive in our results."", 'But now we see starting in the March quarter, and you already see some improvement in our guidance. It will be -- I expect more when we go into the June quarter and through the rest of the calendar year. So, we are positive on the profitability from that product. And we need to take our time to qualify big customers and then to start ramp because, as Dave said, we take a little bit of time to rent high-volume production for the new product.', 'Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.', 'Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Really appreciate it.', 'I guess for Dave, and Gianluca can jump in here, too. The hyperscalers are sort of having some conversation about data center redesign over the coming years, a lot of this is around GPU compute. But they are referring to it as data center redesign more generally and broadly. And I guess would there -- if that occurs, do you have any opinion on if there would be incremental opportunity for nearline drive that would, I guess, substantively be like in addition to whatever data growth is going on? So, I just wanted any thoughts on that in any context.', ""And that's it. Thanks."", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Ananda, it's a real complex topic. What I would say is that the compute infrastructure is changing dramatically, and the memory architectures will change to support that computer architecture very dramatically as well. So, there is a lot of redesign discussion going on."", ""there are different types of applications and things that are being branded AI, there's stuff that's very focused on text or large language models. And then there's image recognition and video creation. And so, there's a lot of different types of applications that are propagating. And I think this is just normal application development that's been going on for years and years and years."", ""But I do think there's different types of hardware. So, I think there are some now AI data centers being discussed that are largely compute. I also think that some of these applications are spinning off a lot of data and they're requiring data to be stored for a certain period of time and then brought back up to the higher levels to be reprocessed. And so, that's just normal data growth as well."", ""So, I think the net of it is there's a lot of architectural redesign going on, probably not affecting the tiers that we're in. If anything, and we made reference to this in the prepared remarks, there's cost power and space or at a premium. There's many AI applications from what I'm hearing that there's just not enough power for and our infrastructure is going to be critical. But to the extent that you can do your part to buy transitioning to higher capacity drives that net-net gives you the same exabyte capacity with less power."", ""I think that's a good thing. It may be an opportunity for us."", 'Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'So, that would be in addition to like the 25% kind of data run rate driven -- that sort of power is a catalyst, Dave?', 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It's hard to say. It depends on the bills and how much people are having to pay for it. Again, I think in the AI applications that are really exploding right now, power is going to become one of the limiting factors. And so, to the extent that there may be a really good payoff in not only cost savings, space savings, and so on but also just freeing up that power infrastructure to go to other things."", 'I mean, that might actually help us get above the 25%.', 'Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Miller of the Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.', 'Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst', ""Thank you for the question, and congratulations on the launch of Mozaic. I'm just wondering, you mentioned it briefly. What kind of traction are you seeing from AI-related opportunities? And what do you -- how do you see that ramping throughout the year?"", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Mark, me, I'm pretty cynical sometimes on these things, and I'm looking for POs that actually say AI on them. And they are starting to happen, but it's still fairly small. And again, I'll go back to my previous comments, these are really applications that have been developing on a lot of fronts over many years anyway."", ""So, say, for example, image recognition, whether it's at the edge or in the cloud, that application space has been developing over time quite a bit. When we get into specific things like large language models where people talk about, I think the data infrastructure impact piece is still secondary to the compute piece even at this point. So, at some point, there will be compute enabling all these really cool applications and efficiencies that people and businesses like ours were taking advantage of and then the data will continue to grow on the back side of that, but we're still early innings on that."", 'Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst', ""So, that's more 2025, you think?"", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""For large language models, I'd say maybe. I don't know exactly."", 'Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks."", 'Dave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Marco. Seagate is focused on executing our product road map, leveraging the advanced technologies in our Mozaic platform, which we believe positions us well to enhance profitability over the near term and capture long-term opportunities for mass capacity storage.

Harrie, Bryce, Ken and I will update you on a record fourth quarter and full year 2023 results as well as other business highlights. PACCAR's outstanding employees delivered the excellent results by providing our customers with the highest quality trucks and transportation solutions in the industry. In 2023, PACCAR achieved annual revenues of $35.1 billion, net income of $4.6 billion, and an after-tax return on revenue of 13.1%. All three were records. PACCAR's strong financial performance benefited from record deliveries of DAF, Kenworth, and Peterbilt's innovative trucks, record results in our parts division, and strong financial services performance. PACCAR shareholders and customers benefited from the $7.8 billion invested over the past 10 years in new products, world-class facilities, and state-of-the-art technologies."", ""PACCAR achieved 85 consecutive years of net income and has paid a dividend every year since 1941. In 2023, PACCAR declared a record $4.24 per share in dividends, including an extra cash dividend of $3.20 per share. PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were $9 billion. Quarterly net income was a record $1.42 billion, which was 54% higher than the prior year. Fourth quarter net income included a $120 million tax provision release in Brazil. PACCAR Parts achieved fourth quarter revenues of $1.61 billion and pre-tax profits of $432 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, PACCAR delivered 51,000 trucks and for the first quarter of 2024, deliveries are forecast to be around 48,000. Last year, US and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 297,000 units."", ""Kenworth and Peterbilt's full year deliveries increased from 96,000 to 109,000. In 2024, the US economy is projected to expand within the truck sector, the vocational less than truckload and medium-duty segments are experiencing strong demand and customers are benefiting from the superior performance of new Kenworth and Peterbilt truck models. The 2024 US and Canadian Class 8 truck market is forecast to be in a range of 260,000 to 300,000 vehicles. European above 16-tonne truck registrations were 343,000 last year. DAF's 2023 European deliveries increased to a record 63,000 trucks. DAF's customers appreciate the industry-leading fuel efficiency and driver comfort of DAF's premium trucks. These trucks have a unique competitive advantage in the European market due to an innovative aerodynamic design that features the largest and most luxurious cab interior."", ""In 2024, the European economy is forecast to grow modestly. We expect the above 16-tonne truck registrations to be in the range of 260,000 to 300,000. Last year, the South American above 16-tonne truck market was 110,000 vehicles and is expected to be similar this year. In Brazil, DAF achieved a record 10.2% share, up from 6.9% last year. DAF Brazil makes a growing contribution to PACCAR's global success. PACCAR full year truck parts and other gross margins were 19.3% and were 19.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong truck deliveries and excellent parts business. We estimate PACCAR's worldwide first quarter truck and parts gross margins to remain strong and be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. 2023 was another great year for PACCAR with many highlights, including revenue and net income records."", ""PACCAR announced a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicle batteries. DAF opened a new electric truck assembly plant and earned the Green Truck award as the most fuel-efficient truck in Europe. PACCAR Parts celebrated its 50th anniversary and Kenworth celebrated its 100-year anniversary. We're looking forward to 2024 being another excellent year. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Harrie?"", ""Harrie Schippers: Thank you, Preston. In 2023, PACCAR Parts set new records for revenues and profits. Annual revenues increased by 11% to $6.4 billion, and pretax profit increased by 18% to $1.7 billion. Parts gross margins climbed to 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the prior year. We estimate part sales to grow by 3% to 5% in the first quarter of this year compared to the record first quarter last year. PACCAR Parts' excellent long-term growth reflects the benefits of investments that increase vehicle uptime and convenience for customers. PACCAR's aftermarket parts and connected services businesses provide strong profitability through all phases of the business cycle. PACCAR parts has 18 Parts Distribution Centers or PDCs worldwide and is expanding its global distribution network with the construction of a new PDC in Masbate Germany, which will open later this year."", ""PACCAR Financial Services achieved a fourth quarter pretax income of $113 million. Annual pretax income was $540 million and portfolio assets increased to $21 billion. The used truck market normalized in 2023. PACCAR continues to experience good sales volumes of its premium used trucks. PACCAR Financial continues to perform well with low past use, the larger portfolio and excellent credit quality. Last year, PACCAR invested $698 million in capital projects and $411 million in research and development. PACCAR's return on invested capital increased to an industry-leading 38%. In 2024, we're planning capital investments in the range of $700 million to $750 million, and R&D expenses in the range of $460 million to $500 million, as we continue to invest in key technology and innovation projects."", ""These include next-generation clean conversion engines, battery and hydrogen electric powertrains, advanced driver assistance systems and new connected vehicle services PACCAR is also investing in additional manufacturing capacity.

CEO Preston Feight could be forgiven for taking a victory lap celebrating the truckmaker’s 85th consecutive year of net profits.', 'No forgiveness needed. The company’s leader since 2019 declined to brag. That’s not the Paccar way. Humility, consistency and conservatism rule the day in Bellevue, Washington, where suit and tie is common attire even in a business culture that has come to eschew such formality.', 'In the company’s earnings release on Tuesday, Feight thanked the 31,100 global employees at Paccar’s three brands: DAF Truck, Kenworth and Peterbilt. He regularly calls them out for their performance. The release also pointed to 85 consecutive years of net profit and a streak of dividend payouts that stretches to 1941.', 'Several analysts on the company’s earnings call Tuesday offered Feight obligatory “great quarter” comments before seeking answers to questions they hoped would help tweak their economic models toward ending an extended streak of underestimating Paccar’s revenue and earnings performance.', 'Feight typically acknowledges those sentiments in the same perfunctory manner in which they’re offered. It was a little different this time.', '“Well, first of all, thanks for the comment on the year,” he told Angel Castillo of Morgan Stanley. “I think our team deserves an incredible amount of credit all around the world for the wonderful performance.”', 'Acknowledging but deflecting praise is as close to celebrating as Feight came.', 'Record results nearly across the board included $35.1 billion in consolidated revenue from trucks, parts and financial services, a 13.1% after-tax return, and income of $4.6 billion. Paccar delivered 109,000 Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks in North America. DAF delivered a record 63,000 trucks in Europe and other global markets.', 'Even the analysts who didn’t offer compliments had some influence on investors who drove\xa0 Paccar shares to a near-record close of $101.01. Since a 3:2 split a year ago, Paccar shares have been on a tear, rising from $67.48 to a 52-week high of $102.20. The intraday price Wednesday was $101.30.', 'Analysts badly botched their estimates for Paccar’s Q4 results, The consensus by investor site Seeking Alpha predicted $2.21 per share on revenues of $8.3 billion. Paccar beat the per share number by a whopping 49 cents. A miss of a few pennies sometimes registers as notable.', 'Such inaccuracies can suggest poor company guidance. No one points to that with Paccar, which has beaten EPS estimates 88% of the time and revenue estimates 100% of the time over the past two years.', 'So, how does Paccar do it?', 'An almost all-new product lineup at its three brands is a factor. The latest makeover, the Class 8 Peterbilt Model 589, enters production this month in Denton, Texas. It replaces the venerable long-nose Model 389 that had such a following that about 200 of them showed up at a celebration outside of the Texas Motor Speedway in May where the Model 589 debuted.', '“We have refreshed our entire product lineup in the last few years,” Feight said. “We have really high-performing products that are delivering excellent results to the customers.”', 'Paccar trails only market leader Daimler Truck North America in sales, which rose 4% in 2023, below expected levels but better than parent Daimler Truck AG’s 1% overall unit sales gain. Sales of International-branded trucks from Traton Group subsidiary Navistar rose 9% to 75,500 in 2023. Volvo Group reports its Q4 results Friday.', 'Paccar Parts leverages ordering and inventory processes to speed deliveries. Its growing global footprint includes a $91.5 million investment in a 240,000-square-foot parts distribution center in Massbach, Germany. Its 20th PDC brings total dedicated space to more than 3.3 million square feet. Paccar Parts reported a 19.4% gross margin in Q4 and sees only a slight pullback in Q1.', 'Feight said a 15% to 20% pullback in equipment sales in Europe where DAF Trucks operates is likely for this year. Unlike others expecting a downturn in North American truck equipment orders, Feight is upbeat.', '“As far as the slowdown in orders, I’m not sure I can recognize that in our major North American markets,” he said. “We see good order intake and good visibility.” Q1 build slots are gone, and Q2 is filling up.”', 'As Muhammad Ali said: “It’s not bragging if you can back it up.”', 'Paccar Q4 sales, profit records overwhelm analyst estimates', 'Peterbilt kicks out the jams to introduce Model 589', 'Peterbilt reveals major redesign of flagship Class 8 Model 579', 'Click for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.', 'The post Commentary: Looking inside Paccar’s humble record streak appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away."", 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' Check out our latest analysis for American Express ', ""If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, American Express has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 39%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors."", ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It's noted that American Express' revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for American Express remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 9.6% to US$54b.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$174m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of American Express but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves."", ""American Express' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching American Express very closely. If you think American Express might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company."", 'Although American Express certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the importance of payout ratios, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios.\xa0', ""Investors have traditionally shown a strong preference for dividend stocks because of their ability to generate income. When seeking stocks that provide a steady income stream, investors often lean toward companies that have a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time. Such companies typically maintain low payout ratios, indicating robust cash generation capabilities. Payout ratio is a measure indicating the percentage of a company's net income or free cash flow that is distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it implies that the company has the potential to sustain or even increase its dividend payments in the future. Adam Kramer, who oversees the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund, discussed payout ratios in a report. Here is what he said:"", '""It\'s important to analyze the stability of a company’s cash flows when assessing the level of payout. When the payout ratio is more than 50%, you always stress test that ratio.""', 'A high payout ratio indicates that a company is allocating a substantial portion of its earnings towards dividend payments, resulting in a reduced amount of funds available for potential investments in the future growth of the business. In a study conducted by Wellington Management, dividend-paying stocks were categorized into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, known as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, included the lowest dividend payers. The second quintile stocks showed better performance than the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods from 1930 to 2022, while the first and third quintile stocks tied for the second place, outperforming the Index 67% of the time.', ""The study revealed that the success of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks could be attributed to the sustainability issues associated with the excessive dividend payouts of the first quintile. Additionally, the average dividend-payout ratio since 1979 for the first two quintiles of dividend payers within the Russell 1000 Index was highlighted in the study. The first-quintile stocks had an average dividend payout ratio of 74%, while the second quintile had a more moderate 40% average payout ratio. Maintaining a high payout ratio, such as 74%, may pose challenges for a company if it undergoes a decline in earnings. In such circumstances, the company might be compelled to reduce its dividend, a move often interpreted in financial markets as a sign of weakness. This reduction frequently leads to a decline in the company's stock price."", 'Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth.

We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate.

You should. His results speak for themselves, after all. Although it occasionally trails the broad market, over long enough periods, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway consistently outperforms the S&P 500. It might be wise to occasionally poach one of his picks."", ""Here's a look at a handful of recent additions Buffett has made to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. They may be at home in your portfolio as well."", ""Funds like Berkshire Hathaway must disclose their holdings on a quarterly basis, so it's possible to keep tabs on the buys and sells Buffett and his team are making."", ""Except, Berkshire didn't make any noteworthy purchases during the most recently reported third quarter."", 'There were some Q3 additions to be sure. Buffett added shares of media outfit Liberty Live Group, and now owns a new stake Atlanta Braves Holdings as well. Berkshire also now owns a piece of Sirius XM Holdings.', ""None of those new positions, however, are significant or particularly bullish. Berkshire's holdings in Sirius and the Atlanta Braves are still relatively tiny, while its new share buy in Liberty is the result of a restructuring of its parent company and Sirius. Mostly, Buffett did a good deal of selling during Q3, growing Berkshire's cash hoard to a record-breaking $157 billion."", ""There are some recent purchases made by Berkshire Hathaway that you might want to buy as well, however. They were just made in the second quarter of 2023 and happened to survive Q3's culling. In no particular order..."", 'Credit card company Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) has been a Berkshire holding since early last year. Despite just a so-so performance in the meantime -- paired with an uncertain future for the lender -- Buffett and his team of analysts saw fit to pick up another 2.5 million shares of the banking name during Q2. That brings the tally up to nearly 12.5 million.', 'Why buy a stock that is subject to above-average credit risk and a company that didn\'t exactly ace last year\'s so-called ""stress test"" administered by the Federal Reserve? It may be because Capital One is better shielded against a deteriorating credit market than it\'s getting credit for.', 'See, although the company reports credit card delinquencies surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of this year, as Gabelli Global Financial Services Fund manager Ian Lapey noted last year, the lender always has the option to ""tighten its underwriting standards as it did in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and during other recessions.""', ""Capital One has been successfully adjusting its business to this end since the latter half of last year. That's a big reason the stock finally started performing in October."", ""Buffett's been a big, steady buyer of oil stocks of late. One of his favorites, though, has been Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). With Q2's purchase of another 12.4 million shares the conglomerate is now sitting on a 224 million share stake that makes up nearly 5% of Berkshire Hathaway's total equity portfolio."", ""It's a curious pick given oil's future. While consumers are clearly still using it, renewables will inevitably replace carbon-emitting crude eventually."", ""There's still plenty of good money to be made in the oil business though ... now, and for a long while. The International Energy Administration expects consumption of oil to continue growing through 2028, with demand likely to hold steady from that point at least through 2040. It's not too tough to figure out why Buffett's still on board with the stock."", 'Last but not least, Berkshire took on a new 153,000-share stake in homebuilder Lennar (NYSE: LEN.B)(NYSE: LEN) during the second quarter of last year, and is still holding all of it.', ""It's another surprising pick given the seeming current state of the real estate market. Relatively high interest rates along with relatively high home prices have kept sales of new homes down since their 2020 peak, with new home transactions reaching multi-month lows (and approaching multiyear lows) as of the end of last year."", ""Buffett and Berkshire's other stock-pickers, however, arguably understand a very important premise about investing. That is, you own companies for where their underlying businesses are going rather than for where they've been. And with homebuilder confidence soaring for a second consecutive month in January due to easing interest rates, the real estate construction industry's turnaround may be taking shape sooner than expected."", ""And it's not just Lennar. Berkshire Hathaway purchased sizable pieces of homebuilders NVR and D.R. Horton during the second quarter of last year, too, underscoring the team's bullishness on homebuilding."", ""Simply because Warren Buffett recently bought and is sticking with a handful of stocks doesn't inherently mean they're perfect picks for your portfolio as well. Indeed, it's possible -- although not likely -- Berkshire Hathaway has since shed some or even all of these names. We won't know until the fourth quarter's disclosures are made public next month."", ""All the same, in light of Buffett's proven track record it certainly can't hurt to consider his recent picks as prospects for yourself even if they're only going to make up a small portion of your total holdings. He clearly sees something compelling enough with all of these companies to take a swing on them right now.

Results were aided by an increase in net interest income (NII) and lower expenses. Further, higher fee income on the back of a robust credit card performance offered support.

Also, Capital One’s efforts to strengthen its card operations are expected to have provided some support. The consensus estimate for NII of $7.55 billion indicates a 4.9% year-over-year improvement.

Our estimate for the metric is $1.25 billion.The consensus estimate for service charges and other customer-related fees of $436 million implies a 10.4% increase.

We expect the metric to grow to $2.01 billion.Expenses: Capital One has been witnessing a persistent rise in expenses over the past several years because of higher marketing costs. The company’s investment in technology upgrades leads to higher costs. These, along with inflation issues, are expected to have led to an increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest expenses is pinned at $5.57 billion, implying a year-over-year increase of 9.6%.The company expects fourth-quarter 2023 marketing costs to be seasonally higher.Asset Quality: Capital One is expected to have set aside money for potential bad loans, given the risks due to geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns.Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $2.60 billion, indicating a 7.8% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.', 'According to our quantitative model, the chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low.

Basically, lightning might not strike twice. However, the most recent jobs report for December may have reset expectations.', 'First, the print landed at 216,000 new jobs added last month. In contrast, economists expected only 170,000 positions gained. As well, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%. However, experts before the disclosure saw a rise to 3.8%. What does this all translate to? An unexpectedly higher volume of more dollars chasing after fewer goods.', 'That’s inflationary and that may help drive down the relative value of the dollar. And such a dynamic has a clear impact on retail stocks to buy. Last year, circumstances were difficult for many businesses in part because the personal saving rate increased. And it made sense that it did because a greenback that’s worth more incentivizes savings.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'However, a greenback that’s worth less over time? That’s inflationary and that incentives spending. In turn, the below retail stocks to buy offer a compelling argument.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A questionable enterprise prior to the Covid-19 disaster because of the much-discussed death of America’s shopping malls, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) really took a beating when the SARS-Cov-2 virus first came knocking. Structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Simon Property focuses on shopping malls, outlet centers and community/lifestyle centers. During the worst of the pandemic, few people wanted to be around strangers.', 'However, the concept of retail revenge – or pent-up demand for activities and experiences denied – helped lift SPG from the 2020 doldrums. In the past 52 weeks, SPG gained more than 16% of equity value, a respectable performance. Notably, SPG swung higher as rumors hit that the Federal Reserve was contemplating interest rate cuts. Again, a relatively devalued dollar encourages spending.', 'To be fair, SPG suffers from question marks due to wider questions about the brick-and-mortar retail model. However, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a high-side target of $172. Thus, it could be one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top names in the big-box retail space, Target (NYSE:TGT) initially appeared intriguing because of the retail revenge phenomenon. However, management disclosed last year the impact that shoplifting had on profitability. Obviously, that didn’t seem like a particularly encouraging announcement considering wider sensibilities. Basically, Target was communicating that it had little recourse other than to suck it up or close down the most problematic stores.', 'However, late last year, Target reported a better-than-expected earnings print. As well, the company reported robust results for the Black Friday shopping season. All in all, the big-box retailer demonstrated that despite consumer challenges, shoppers were continuing to visit Target locations. That meant that the company enjoyed some brand power, a not-insignificant advantage in an ultra-competitive cycle.', 'Financially, Target enjoys a 15.7% three-year revenue growth rate, beating out 83.45% of its peers. Also, its return on invested capital (ROIC) – the ability to convert capital into profitable investments – comes in at 10.5%, better than 75.32% of the sector. Thus, TGT ranks among the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Bolingbrook, Illinois, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is a chain of beauty stores. While a relevant sector, a tough economic backdrop hurt investor sentiment. In the past 52 weeks, ULTA shares dipped more than 5%. With high inflation and high borrowing costs, many consumers opted for cheaper alternatives – the trade-down effect. However, if interest rates decline, ULTA could be one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'For one thing, with more people having more discretionary funds to spend, increased demand for pampering should be expected. Moving forward, we could see Ulta leveraging its on-site beauty salons. As well, consumers may opt for top shelf, higher-margin products. Both may help reinvigorate sentiment. Indeed, ULTA popped higher late last year, coinciding with lower interest rate rumors.', 'Financially, Ulta performs quite well with a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7%, beating out almost 77% of its rivals. However, the real star could be the ROIC which clocks in at 31%, above 96% of competitors. Thus, it’s an intriguing prospect for retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', 'Another beneficiary of a better-than-expected jobs report could be Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Practically a cultural icon at this point, Starbucks fuels a large chunk of the U.S. economy. How so? In addition to hiring countless thousands of people – thus providing first-time work experience for many – the brand also keeps workers focused. According to the National Coffee Association of USA, seven in 10 Americans drink coffee every week.', 'Invariably, a large volume of this consumption stems from Starbucks. Now, the narrative understandably encountered challenges in 2023. You can tell by its 52-week loss of almost 13%. That’s very un-Starbucks like. However, with the dollar rising in relative value due to higher interest rates, people naturally chose to save their greenbacks.', 'Moving forward, more people should have more dollars from more jobs being worked. That should give increased discretionary purchasing power. Also, because these dollars will be worth less over time, an incentive exists to do something with it.', 'Why not reward yourself with Starbucks? Analysts see a price target of $110, making SBUX one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'Mentioning Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as one of the retail stocks to buy may be controversial because of its impact. As The New York Times pointed out a few years back, mom-and-pop stores just can’t compete with the e-commerce juggernaut. So, Amazon’s giant vacuum cleaner continues to scour the nation, devastating small businesses and enlarging itself. It’s an ugly situation but you can’t argue with the results.', 'In the past 52 weeks, AMZN gained nearly 59% of equity value. Yes, it’s still off from its all-time highs. However, the security’s downturn in 2022 appears a forgotten memory. Further, if the Fed actually goes through with interest rate cuts, Amazon may have some more time with blue skies. In an inflationary cycle, more dollars will chase after fewer goods. As stated before, this should incentivize spending.', 'To be clear, AMZN is no discount, trading at 78.61X trailing-year earnings. However, the company enjoys a massive three-year revenue growth rate of 21.9%. Also, it features a very decent ROIC of 6.84%. Unsurprisingly, it’s a unanimous strong buy among 42 expert voices.', 'Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com', 'During the worst of the pandemic, a few retail stocks to buy offered surprising relevance. One such company was Nike (NYSE:NKE). A popular athletic apparel and sports equipment manufacturer, when enterprises shifted abruptly to remote work protocols, demand for traditional office attire declined. In its place were hoodies and sweatpants and other super-casual attire – things that Nike specializes in.', 'However, with the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy in 2022, NKE incurred a steep correction. Last year, shares were all over the map. In the past 52 weeks, NKE dropped more than 20% of equity value. Further, the company faces competitive pressures as small rivals aim to take market share in the athletic apparel ecosystem.', 'Still, for speculators, Nike may deserve a second look because of its brand and pricing power. For example, in the quarter ended November 2023, Nike’s gross margin stood at 44.6%. That was noticeably above the year-ago quarter’s print of 42.89%. This indicates that consumers overall gravitate toward Nike, making it one of the retail stocks to buy.', 'Source: RYO Alexandre / Shutterstock.com', 'A contrarian idea among retail stocks to buy, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) undoubtedly presents risks. Yes, a currency that devalues over time incentivizes some action toward it, including spending it. Otherwise, if you hold the cash, you will basically incur a hidden tax. It’s just not a smart thing to do but to buy a car? That doesn’t seem very smart either.', 'However, the reality is that for many people in the U.S. – particularly those outside of metropolitan areas on the east coast – a personal vehicle is a necessity. That’s one of the reasons many Californians don’t like environmental protocols that attempt to push residents into more sustainable transportation. Having a car is an absolute necessity in many areas because the public transportation system is a joke.', 'But here’s another, more important factor at play: the cars on our roadways are old. In 2023, the average age of passenger vehicles hit a record 12.5 years. As advanced as reliability statistics have become, mechanical devices always break down.', 'Combined with possibly lower interest rates, more people may be attracted to replacement vehicles.

About 10 years after being created, gene-editing specialist CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) earned approval for its first therapy late last year. The treatment in question is called Casgevy and targets sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), two blood-related diseases. This regulatory development was a significant milestone for CRISPR, but the biotech will need more clinical and regulatory success in the years ahead to keep investors happy.', ""Can CRISPR Therapeutics pull that off? Let's find out how things might evolve for the biotech over the next five years."", 'CRISPR Therapeutics developed Casgevy with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. So far, the therapy has earned approval in the U.K., the U.S., and Bahrain. More regulatory nods should be coming pretty soon, including in the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. Of note, Casgevy is the first gene-editing treatment on the market that uses the Nobel prize-winning CRISPR/Cas9 technique.', ""However, investors will be more interested in how successful the therapy could become. CRISPR and Vertex priced Casgevy at $2.2 million in the U.S., not an unreasonable price for a gene-editing treatment. Administering these medicines isn't easy. It requires specialized equipment, trained physicians, and a pretty long process."", ""In other words, it will take some time for Casgevy's sales to ramp up -- but once they do, it should allow CRISPR Therapeutics to generate steady revenue. Why? Consider that Vertex and CRISPR are initially targeting 32,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe, not to mention those in other regions, such as the Middle East, where Casgevy should also be commercialized."", ""That gives the therapy a total addressable market north of $70 billion. Yes, CRISPR and Vertex will have to compete with Bluebird Bio, which has gene-editing treatments for TDT and SCD on the market. But here is why that's not that big a problem."", ""First, Bluebird only operates in the U.S. Second, Vertex is a much larger biotech than either Bluebird or CRISPR, and it has a track record of negotiating lucrative deals with third-party payers. Third, Bluebird's SCD treatment, Lyfgenia, has a boxed warning for blood cancer. Lastly, Lyfgenia will cost $3.1 million, compared to Casgevy's $2.2 million."", 'All these factors suggest that CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals can grab a decent share of their target market, at the very least. The two partners will divide up the spoils on a 60/40 basis, with 40% of the profits and costs going to CRISPR. Even with this arrangement in place, the biotech should still be making plenty of money from Casgevy in five years.', ""Casgevy could earn label expansions, first in treating patients aged 5 through 11 -- its current approvals cover those 12 years or older. Further, hundreds of thousands of SCD patients won't be eligible for Casgevy as of now, but CRISPR and Vertex are working on potential label expansions to target them too."", 'Beyond Casgevy, CRISPR Therapeutics should make solid clinical progress over the next five years. In 2024 alone, it expects clinical updates for two of its leading oncology candidates, CTX112 and CTX131, and new clinical trial starts for other products, while it is also undergoing phase 1 studies for still other programs. In other words, 2024 should be a busy year for the company.', 'The work it does throughout the next 12 months should help it lay a foundation for future major regulatory success beyond Casgevy. In the next five years, expect the company to earn approval for at least one more CRISPR-based gene editing treatment.', ""CRISPR Therapeutics' work in developing Casgevy has been exceptional. The company is better positioned to push other clinical programs through the pipeline. Although the biotech won't hit gold with every candidate, there is more than enough for CRISPR to expand its lineup over time significantly."", 'In short, the company has proven innovative capabilities and a rich pipeline, and thanks to Casgevy, it will have the funds necessary to support its ambitious gene-editing platform.

An ABR of 1.62 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy, representing 69.2% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VRTX', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Vertex here>>>The ABR suggests buying Vertex, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is VRTX Worth Investing In?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Vertex, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $15.08.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Vertex.

Please go ahead.', 'David Rosenberg', ""Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, up $3.6 billion in last year's fourth quarter. Segment profit in the quarter was $384 million, up $78 million from the fourth quarter of 2022. During this year's fourth quarter, adjusted income from continuing operations was $1.60 per share, compared to $1.23 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $380 million in the quarter, up $12 million from last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, revenues were $13.7 billion, up $814 million from last year. In 2023, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up $191 million from '22. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $5.59 per share as compared to $4.45 per share in '22. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $931 million, down $247 million from '22.With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Our business has closed out the year with another solid quarter with strong margin performance and cash generation. Throughout the year, our team has worked to mitigate supply chain challenges to deliver products to our customers. At Aviation, while we ended the year with an expectation of a book-to-bill 1:1 solid order flow and customer demand across our product portfolio resulted in a year-end backlog of $7.2 billion, an increase of $782 million. Textron Aviation Defense delivered 13 T-6 aircraft for the year, up 10 from a year ago. During 2023, solid aircraft utilization within the Textron Aviation product portfolio resulted in a 6.5% growth in aftermarket revenuesAt Bell, revenues in the quarter were up driven by higher commercial and military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 91 helicopters in the fourth quarter, up from 71 in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered 171 helicopters in 2023, down from 179 in 2022. The higher military revenues reflected the continued ramp on our FARA program. On the FARA program, Bell completed the installation of the ITEP engine on the 360 Invictus, the team continues to conduct integration activities and prepare the aircraft for initial ground runs in 2024.Moving to Textron Systems. Revenue and margin were flat with last year's fourth quarter. During the quarter, Systems delivered the last detailed design and construction craft on the Ship-to-Shore Connector program following its successful completion of acceptance trials.Moving to Industrial. We saw higher revenues in the quarter, driven by higher volume in Caltex and favorable pricing in specialized vehicles. Moving to Aviation. Pipistrel delivered 135 aircraft during the year, up from 61 in 2022. Also at eAviation, during the quarter, the Pipistrel Velis Electro was selected to participate for a trial period to explore operational and trading uses for this all-electric aircraft as part of Agility Prime, the Air Force's (inaudible) program. Summary, in 2023, the year we had a strong year across all of our businesses. We continue to execute on our growth strategy of ongoing investments in new products and programs to drive organic growth and margin expansion. During the year, Aviation announced the new Cessna Citation at (inaudible) base and Cessna Citation CJ3 Gen2 at NBAA. In May, Aviation delivered the first passenger variant of the Cessna Sky Courier (inaudible) Airlines servicing the Hawaiian Islands. In the third quarter, Aviation announced a new fleet agreement with NetJets for up to 1,500 aircraft over 15 years, including Longitude, Latitude and the newly announced Ascend, extending our 40-plus year relationship. In October, Aviation delivered the 100th Cessna Citation Longitude. At Bell, we began work on the FARA program in April. The team continues to increase activity on the program, ramping up engineering resources, contracting with key suppliers and ordering long-lead materials.At Textron Systems, we advanced for the future tactical unmanned aircraft system competition and are now 1 of 2 remaining competitors down from the initial 5. Systems also continued to win on land vehicle programs advancing to the next phase of the army's XM30 program as part of TeamLink and was selected as 1 of 4 competitors to build RCV light protypes for the Army. At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we introduced the new Street legal EasyGo Liberty LSV powered by our Elite lithium-ion battery system. At Caltex in 2023, we announced the first pentatonic order from an automotive OEM for thermoplastic composite underbody battery protection skin plate, establishing Caltex as a supplier to the expanding battery electric vehicle market.In Aviation, during the year, we began system level (inaudible) of the first Nuuva prototype, our hybrid electric unmanned cargo vital aircraft in preparation for first flight in 2024. As we closed out 2023, manufacturing performance was trending positively with improvements in labor productivity and supplier deliveries.Looking to 2024, Aviation, we're projecting growth driven by increased deliveries across all product lines and higher aftermarket volume. At Bell, we're projecting rev growth in 2024 on higher military revenues from the FARA program and higher commercial revenues from increased deliveries. At Systems, we're expecting slightly higher revenue as new programs continue to ramp. At Industrial, we're expecting flat revenues as growth in specialized vehicles is offset by lower-than-expected volume at Caltex. At Aviation, we plan to continue investments in the development of technologies and products, supporting sustainable flight solutions for unmanned cargo, next-generation electric trainers, eVTOL and general aviation. We also expect higher aircraft deliveries at Pipistrel. This overall backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $14.6 billion, up 7% from 2023 and for Textron's 2024 fiscal year. We're projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."", 'Frank Thomas Connor', ""Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.5 billion were down $58 million from the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting lower volume and mix of $158 million, partially offset by higher pricing of $100 million. Segment profit was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up $23 million from a year ago, reflecting a favorable impact from pricing net of inflation of $51 million, partially offset by lower volume and mix of $22 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $7.2 billion. Moving to Bell, revenues were $1.1 billion, up $255 million from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting higher commercial revenues of $171 million, largely driven by increased deliveries and higher military revenues of $84 million related to the FARA program. Segment profit of $118 million, was up $55 million from a year ago, primarily driven by higher volume and mix of $39 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.8 billion. At Textron Systems, revenues were $314 million, flat with last year's fourth quarter. Segment profit of $35 million was equal to last year's fourth quarter. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2 billion. Industrial revenues were $961 million, up $54 million from last year's fourth quarter, largely reflecting higher volume and mix at Caltex and a favorable impact from pricing at Textron Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit of $57 million was up $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher pricing net of inflation of $18 million. Textron eAviation segment revenues were $10 million and the segment loss was $23 million in the fourth quarter of '23, which reflected the research and development costs for the initiatives related to the development of sustainable aviation solutions. Finance segment revenues were $12 million and profit was $4 million. Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $45 million. Net interest expense was $13 million. LIFO inventory provision was $21 million, intangible asset amortization was $9 million, and the non-service components of pension and postretirement income was $60 million. In November, we announced a restructuring plan that resulted in pretax special charges of $126 million in the fourth quarter. We anticipate the restructuring plan will be substantially completed in the first half of 2024, resulting in annualized cost savings of approximately $75 million.Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $380 million in the quarter. For the year, manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $931 million, down $247 million from the prior year. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares, returning $283 million in cash to shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 16.2 million shares, returning $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders.Turning now to our 2024 outlook on Slide 7. We're expecting adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share. We're also expecting manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to be about $900 million to $1 billion. Moving to segment outlook on Slide 8 and beginning with Textron Aviation, we're expecting revenues of about $6 billion. Segment margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 12% to 13%. Looking to Bell, we expect revenues of about $3.5 billion. We're forecasting a margin in the range of 9.5% to 10.5%.At Systems, we're estimating revenues of about $1.25 billion with a margin in the range of about 11% to 12%. At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.8 billion and a margin in a range of 6% to 7%. At Aviation, we're expecting revenues of $50 million and a segment loss of $25 million, reflecting our continued investment in sustainable aviation solutions. At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $30 million. Looking to Slide 8, we're projecting about $160 million of corporate expense. We're also projecting about $90 million of net interest expense, $110 million of LIFO inventory provision, $35 million of intangible asset amortization and $265 million of nonservice pension income. We expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%.Turning to Slide 10. R&D is expected to be about $550 million, down from $570 million last year. We're estimating CapEx will be about $425 million, up from $402 million in 2023. Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 191 million shares in 2024.That concludes our prepared remarks. So Leah, we can open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And I would now like to start with Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', 'Scott, maybe first one for you. How do we think about 2024 aviation deliveries and just book-to-bill in the context of your guidance?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Sure, Sheila, I think we'll continue to see a ramp on the production side. As I noted, I think we did in the fourth quarter, start to see some improved productivity in the line. There are still some supplier issues, but number of parts coming into PO are improving somewhat. So I think that will help us continue to increase volume here as we go through into 2024. So I certainly see unit deliveries being up on a year-over-year basis. The market is still strong. I mean, obviously, our book-to-bill covers '24 deliveries quite well. But I think our expectation, as we said coming into the year was kind of targeting a 1:1 book-to-bill. We did better than that obviously in 2023, but our assumption as we go into 2024 is that we'll see a 1:1 book-to-bill. So the market is still good. I think we're seeing nice stimulation and some of the new products coming out, like CJ3 Gen2 has been really well received. Ascend, I think will start to also drive strong demand, and overall, the product lineup is in good shape. So I think market-wise, we're good, and we will see, obviously, to get to the guide of around $6 billion on Aviation side, we will see continued volume on both aircraft production as well as aftermarket growth."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Can we get to about 200 deliveries in '24? Do you think that's reasonable?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""We are -- as you know, we don't put a number out there, but it will be increased from 2023."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', 'Got it. And if I could ask one of FLRAA just good progress on the program with (inaudible). But I think revenues were about $175 million in 2023, fell short of our expectations. And how do we think about 2024, we have about $850 million of FLRAA according to the budget. So, how is that (inaudible)?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""I think -- for sure, Sheila, I think our revenues were higher than that on FLRAA probably for the year. We won't break out all the details, but it was certainly just south of a few hundred million dollars. But we do expect as we go into '24. The program is reacting very nicely. As you know, like the number was lighter than we originally expected, just because of the delay with the protest in the early part of the year. But the ramp -- as we've ramped after the contract award is going really well. So I would expect a number closer to the $900 million range in 2024 on the FLRAA program."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to a question from Peter Arment with Baird.', 'Peter J. Arment', ""Just maybe -- just circle back just on how you're thinking about kind of the margin leverage in aviation, Scott, when you think about just because you called out some of the pricing that you continue to get. How are we thinking about just kind of that flowing through? I mean just given the margin outlook of 12% to 13% kind of at the low end of the range, it's flat, but at the upper end, obviously, 100 basis points. Just how are you thinking about that?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Sure. Look, Peter, I think we definitely expect to continue to see price net of inflation is a positive for us. It won't be as significant as it was in 2023, but we still have good pricing in the backlog, and I think it will be a tailwind for us. So if you look at the guide and the numbers, you're right. Look, I mean, we're -- as I said, I think we saw some improved performance in Q4 on the manufacturing conversion side. So we're bringing -- we're certainly baking some of that in as we go into 2024, but as you move towards the high side of the guidance, you get up into that 20-plus percent conversion, which is where we historically like the business to be. So it's something we've got to work on, obviously. We still have some of those headwinds that we faced all this year on the operating side, but the combination of improved performance and continued price over inflation is positive, while it's not as big a positive, I think, will help us get towards that 20-plus range."", 'Peter J. Arment', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then just Frank quickly, the interest expense increase, just maybe what's going on there specifically?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', 'Well, go ahead.', 'Frank Thomas Connor', ""Yes, a little. We've got slightly higher borrowing costs from the bond deal that we did last year. So that's a little bit of the rollover on the financing. It assumes slightly lower cash balances and a little bit of conservatism around the interest rate that we earn on that excess cash."", 'Operator', 'And next, we go to David Strauss with Barclays.', 'David Egon Strauss', 'Scott, I wanted to ask about the V-22 grounding. Does that impact Bell at all? I know you have a pretty big aftermarket business on the V-22?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""No, David, I don't think it's a material impact. The services, frankly, are using the opportunity -- the grounding to continue to do their maintenance activities and get aircraft ready to fly. So we probably can't say much more about that situation than that. But no, I don't expect it to be a material impact."", 'David Egon Strauss', ""Okay. And Frank, free cash flow. The guidance were flat. I know you had a pretty big inventory build in '23, but you also had positive advances. What are you assuming for working capital? And in terms of the adjusted EPS guide, what are you baking in as far as share count and share repo in '24?"", 'Frank Thomas Connor', ""Yes. From a cash standpoint, we obviously are anticipating volume growth in the year. So that's going to put a little continued pressure on inventory levels as we look kind of to '24 and '25 volume growth, not a lot. There is a little bit of working capital pressure with the timing of some customer payment activity, particularly on the military side. Bell, in particular, had a very good year in '23 in terms of the timing of payment activity that puts a little bit of a headwind on cash flow. And then as you heard a little higher CapEx guidance kind of -- in terms of the spend there. So it's not any one item. It's kind of a little bit of headwinds on working capital associated with the things I mentioned and a little bit higher levels of investment. But we still think we're -- there's still very solid cash flow performance for the year. In terms of the share count, we talked about 191 million average shares. So kind of roughly 5% or so reduction in average share count for the year."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to Jason Gursky with Citi.', 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Scott, I was wondering if you could just spend a few more minutes on Systems and talk about the pipeline of opportunities there and the timing of potential awards kind of with the backdrop of what's going on with the budget in mind and whether things like continuing resolutions to go out half a year have any impact on kind of your expectations around those?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""So the CR situation right now doesn't really worry me very much on the system side of things. As we indicated, Jason, we're going to be relatively flattish on the revenue in 2024, I'd say the pipeline is very strong. You look at some of these down selects on FTUAS, the ARV program, what used to be the OMFV program, XM30 program. A lot of these things are significant opportunities for us. Thay are really important down selects that we achieved last year. We'll execute on those, and they're not big growth programs so they don't really have a CR impact that I'm too concerned about. And there are virtually all programs that will have their next significant contractual award down select in 2025. So that's why you see us kind of flattish. We had -- I think 2023 was a hugely important year for the down selects on those really important programs, execute this year and you start to see the revenue growth driven by ultimately being final selection awards, EMD programs that award in 2025."", 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Okay. Great. And then just quickly on eAviation. We've got widening profitability losses they're projected for '24 on higher revenue. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a broad brush update on the plans for that business? And at what point does the revenue potentially pick up here and you begin to see those profitability losses begin to contract? And kind of your overall vision for that business over the next, I don't know, 3 to 5 years?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Sure. Absolutely. Look, keep in mind, there's 2 things going on in that eAviation segment, right? There's Pipistrel, which is our current -- it's a real business, real sales, roughly doubling the volume of aircraft sales from '22 to '23, roughly doubling '23 to '24. So I think the product lineup at Pipistrel is doing quite well. We're expanding distribution channels. It's a relatively small business, but it's doing well. What's driving the losses is these investments in R&D, particularly around the NEXUS program, that's something that won't generate revenue probably for several years and investment on, say, the Nuuva 300 which is our hybrid unmanned cargo which, again, this is a few years from revenue. And so that's part of why just we broke this thing out, right? So you guys see these investments, which are, frankly, not dependent or tied to the revenue within that segment. So the 2 big moving pieces in there in terms of the investment side are the Nuuva on the unmanned cargo and the Nexus on the sort of the eVTOL side, which, again, I don't think that has to be necessarily dependent to operability, but just GA in general. That -- both of those teams are making great shape. I think we'll see first flight of the Nuuva in 2024. We've also begun the assembly and wings and fuselage build on the NEXUS program in Wichita. So both programs are making very good progress, but they're both technology investment programs."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.', 'Noah Poponak', ""Scott, we've heard some discussion in the business jet end market that even though 2023 was a decent order year that there's actually maybe some pent-up demand because it was so consensus that there was going to be a recession or something like it. And that in 2024 if we're having an inflation desell and rate cuts and some version of a soft landing that you could have your normal underlying demand plus anybody that deferred from '23. And so I'm curious if you hear that from your customers or your sales force and there's an upside case for bookings? Or is that too aggressive and just stick with book-to-bill of 1?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, look, no, I think as I said at the beginning, we feel good about the end market. Customer dialogues are robust. Frankly, the only headwind that I see would run through is just on availability, right? People would like to get aircraft sooner. So we're -- I think our sales folks are out there working hard. There's no doubt there's demand. I think that's, as I said earlier, helped by the fact that we've got some new models that are coming out that are going to be really well received in the market. So, look, all in all, as we talked about, the book-to-bill number can change a little bit quarter to quarter, but I think we feel very good about the end market. I think we'll stick at this point with our kind of one-to-one in our base assumption as we did in 2023. And if the market remains that robust, we can exceed that number, which would be great. So look, I think the market remains strong. It's -- we feel good about it."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. And I wondered if you could just maybe discuss a little more -- just how much better is supply chain, labor, your ability to get airplanes out the door. The delivery number was down in '23, despite all the demand, kind of to your point there on availability. Whatever the '24 delivery plan is, it's got to be up a lot to get to that revenue guidance. Do you feel like you really have that hitting the ground running in January here? And then as that pertains to the margin, why would price net of inflation not be better if that -- if pricing is still good, I know the rate of change matters, but if that -- if the cost inflation and disruption piece settles down significantly for you?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, look, I'd say I don't know how to quantify the exact number for you Noah, but there's a couple of dynamics here that make us feel good about it. Again, we saw better labor productivity, all the metrics we track in terms of training hours, direct -- charging to indirect, all those sorts of things, applied hours. We're positive in the quarter. We do track a number of parts that are late to PO. These numbers are getting better. Also, I think as you look at the '23 to '24, we have net less hiring we need to do to hit the ramp. Last year was a big year in terms of onboarding new people. As you can imagine, that's very disruptive. It's a lot of training that takes not just the new people, but it takes a lot of our capable people to help train and develop them. We made a lot of investments in 2023 around new training facilities. So -- but the absolute number, we still need to onboard new people, for sure. But on -- the number of them is less than what it was in 2023, and that should be helpful. The supply chain thing, as I said, look, it is getting better, but it's still susceptible to the wrong part, not being available, right? I mean I think it's going to help us do less out of station work but we still have suppliers we're keeping a close eye on because a lack of delivery on their part could hold up an aircraft. So we're still being cautious about how we work through that, but it has improved. And like I said, there is really less hiring. I think most of our lines are flowing better as a result of all the things I just talked about. So that we do factor that into our ability to hit that larger number of aircraft deliveries in '24. And I think we'll get there."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. That's good. I'm just going to ask one more. The Bell margin, pretty strong in the quarter, close to '23, well ahead of the initial plan. This '24 guide, 9.5 to 10.5, kind of flat year-over-year. There was a view that this was going to 7%, 8% as you ramped FLRAA, you're ramping FLRAA, that's not happening. Can you talk about how you're outperforming there and absorbing the FLRAA ramp is '24, the trough? Or does that still need to go down some number of hundreds of basis points before than going back up?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', 'Look, Noah. I think, look, the team is doing everything they can to manage costs, control -- do the right cost actions here as we see the ramp down on some of these military production programs, and we continue to do that. Those were certainly better mix than a big cost-plus EMD program. So we still will have some pressure around the margin rate. But as we talked about that, the growth benefit of seeing this program ramp up, we believe will still generate accretive, not dollars. So even if we see some pressure on the margin rate, the business will still be contributing positively to the overall dollars and therefore EPS for the business.', 'Operator', 'And next, we go to the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""I was hoping to circle on Aviation. In the last few quarters, there's been more discussion of this performance as a negative variance to the profit walk. That wasn't part of the conversation. It was clearly price offset by a little bit of volume. So is it fair to think that, that bucket of performance that you all cite has materially become nonmaterial?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, I wouldn't say nonmaterial. I would say, Myles -- and look in 2023, we had pretty significant price over inflation benefits. And I think we did talk through the course of the year that, that did help to offset some of the performance issues that were driven by these labor inefficiencies and supplier impacts and stuff like that. So I think, as you look at 2024, we're expecting improved margins. We're absolutely expecting significantly improved revenue and therefore, operating profit in the business. But the trade you're going to see is there's probably still positive price over inflation, but not as big a number. But you're going to have less performance issue to have to cover with that number because we do expect to see better efficiencies in the factories and lesser impact from the supply. So net of all this stuff, I mean, there's a different dynamic, I believe, in 2024. That's how we're going to get there than 2023. But the bottom line, you're going to see significant revenue growth and significant operating profit, including expanding margin in 2024."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""Okay. And then on the restructuring program, you executed, I think, about 60% maybe was directed at Bell. Of the $75 million gross savings you talked about, how much net savings is Bell getting in '24? And also is Bell getting most of the lower R&D benefit?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, look, I mean we don't -- we're probably not going to break that all the way down, but certainly part of why the discussion I just had with Noah around, why are we seeing some better margins and holding in there on the margin rates at Bell is this is part of why we took that restructuring action to control cost and manage our way as we reduce the volume in some of these historic military production programs. And so that's part of what's helping to sustain a better margin rate even as we see those programs ramped out. We just have to take the cost out of the business in the areas that we're largely supporting these big military production programs. So I won't put the exact number in there, but that's the dynamic that's helping to improve that -- for that margin."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', 'And is R&D drop there mostly in Bell?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Yes, it is. I mean, as you know, we don't break that all the way out. But look, we still had, as you recall, the delay of the FLRAA program in 2023, we had more of our own costs, still sustaining and supporting that program in the earlier part of the year, obviously, as that has ramped and become a full-blown contract, that's helping to reduce that number. The overall gross R&D, the business is still growing significantly as FLRAA ramps, but the net number in terms of the IRAD side is certainly shifted from that IRAD into the contract over."", 'Operator', 'And the next question we have is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. She has disconnected. We will move on to the next line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.', 'Robert Alan Stallard', ""Scott, I just have to follow up on Noah's question about the supply chain and the parts behind at the moment. Are there any specific areas where you're seeing any problems like interiors that are holding things up?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Nothing that I would comment on a call. There's -- we all have our problem (inaudible), Rob."", 'Robert Alan Stallard', ""Yes. Understood. And then secondly, there's been some press reports that Textron has been looking at some M&A competitions in recent months. I don't expect you to comment on that. But I'm sorry, if you could maybe reiterate your priorities for capital deployment as we start 2024?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Sure. No, we definitely would not comment on that. And look, I think what we've talked about and Frank's indication on the share count of 191 million, obviously indicates that our priority continues to be a share buyback, and that makes, we think, at this point, a pretty significant benefit for our shareholders, and that's what we expect to continue to do in 2024."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', 'I guess just asking about the performance at eAviation and kind of the improvement in productivity and parts availability that you started to see in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that in the first quarter, we can expect to see kind of a nice increase in deliveries and something that would kind of affirm the notion of being on track for the revenue guide for the year?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, we're not going to get into quarterly guidance for sure, Seth. I mean, you certainly should expect to see a nice progression in terms of the revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis over 2023, consistent with the guide of $6 billion of revenue for the total year."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe just following up a little bit different twist on Rob's question. I know you probably won't comment on specific M&A reports. But the reports that we have read tend to deal mainly with the space end market. I wonder if you could comment on -- do you view that as an important and/or attractive end market into which to expand?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""I wouldn't comment."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', 'Fair enough. All right.', 'Operator', 'And next, we go to the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.', 'Kristine Liwag', 'Can you hear me okay?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', 'Yes, we can hear you fine.', 'Kristine Liwag', ""On your restructuring actions, can you provide more details on what you're doing and what your expectations are for the timing and the size of the payback from your investments?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, Kristine, as we kind of put out there, there's a sizable piece that's going into Bell, and that's really aligning our cost structure with the lower production rates on some of the historic military programs like H1 and V-22. That's a very -- in terms of cost and the mix of people within the business, the ramp obviously is net positive, but it's largely in the engineering program side of the FLRAA program. So it's a necessary action to align costs with the old historic production programs.As we also indicated, we're just -- we're aligning some of our plans on the auto side to understand where is demand around the world and rationalizing where we think it's appropriate to keep that business healthy with a high return and strong cash flow. So just -- there's bits in a number of other places. But we believe on a run rate basis, it's going to be about a $75 million a year positive impact to the business. And so that's, I think, a good return and why we decided to proceed with the program."", 'Kristine Liwag', ""Great. And maybe on Aviation, if I could do a follow-up. $100 million in pricing power for new aircraft is very healthy. And so if we're seeing -- if you're continuing to see bottlenecks and new aircraft production, can you talk about the demand environment for aircraft services then? And what's the pricing power in services, especially with the lack of new airplanes coming into the market?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Look, I think what we saw this year, which was strong growth, 6.5% on the services side. Obviously, that's a mixture between volume and pricing. I expect we'll continue to see good demand on that side, we certainly have that baked into our forecast. Aircraft are flying. Our customers are running the aircraft. They're doing its necessary maintenance. So I think it will continue to be a healthy part. Certainly, what we've incorporated in the guide for next year is good growth in the service business, both our service centers as well as the parts. And as always, that's going to be a function of both volume increases as well as annual expected pricing in the aftermarket side."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.', 'George D. Shapiro', 'Scott, I was just curious, you were saying that the supply chain seems better, yet the deliveries in the fourth quarter were a lot lighter than what most of us were looking for. So if you could kind of just connect the 2 dots there?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Look, George, as you know, it takes many months to build an aircraft. So the improvements in both the labor side and the parts side takes a while to push through the system. So the higher cost and a lot of the impacts that we kind of saw through the course of the year were full year impact. So -- but I do feel like as we look at the numbers, and what we experience on a day-to-day basis, we did see improvements. And I think that's -- as a result, you'll start to see that improvement as you get into 2024."", 'George D. Shapiro', ""And then 1 other one. The book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9 and the orders were like only $1.4 billion. So that was really down a lot from last year as well as from the third quarter now. I guess you're just looking at as timing or to have anything to do with Noah's comment that people concerned about a recession in the fourth quarter, we get a pickup this year. But if you could just comment on that as well."", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""George, I think it's largely timing. We always have a little bit of lumpiness in terms of when deposits are coming in on some of our larger customers, but there's -- I don't think there's anything concerning there. We've said all along, we expect there's going to be some quarters where it's going to be below 1:1, probably some quarters where it's above 1:1. But again, our assumption full year going all the way back through '23 was 1:1. We did better than that. Our assumption in 2024 is it's going to be 1:1, and obviously, we'll see how the market plays out. But I still think we feel good about the end market. We feel good about demand, and I think it's healthy."", 'George D. Shapiro', ""And 1 last one. The strong Bell margin in the quarter, I mean, does that just really reflect the commercial delivery strength, which has much higher margins, more than offsetting, the drag from the lower-margin FLRAA program. And if that would continue next year, the margins would probably be somewhat higher than what you've guided to?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""George, I think look, we're continuing to see good margins on our military business, obviously outside of the FLRAA side. It certainly helps to have higher commercial deliveries. We -- I think we'll get some benefit of higher commercial deliveries as we talked about in 2024. But look, there's going to continue to be some pressure on the margins because we are seeing significant growth in the FLRAA program. The reason we did the cost action and did the restructuring was to try to shore up the profitability of the business on the legacy production programs. And so, part of the guide is, obviously, we continue to see some benefit of that. But again, there will be overall margin rate pressure going into the future. But I think as we talked about, even with that and the growth of the FLRAA program, we're going to see significant revenue growth, and we're going to see absolute up profit increases and accretion to EPS for the business. So I think as we work through a transition from legacy production to a new EMD program. I think we can manage our way through that well. And obviously, long term, it's going to be a great story for Bell."", 'Operator', 'Next, we move to Pete Skibitski with Olympic Global.', 'Peter John Skibitski', 'Scott, can you expand on your opening comments regarding Kautex and your expectations there in 2024? It sounds like you think you might be a little bit weak there. Just was wondering what the drivers were?', 'Operator', ""Sure, Pete. Look, that's one business where we really depend on sort of industry customer forecasts. So our guide reflects that. We don't really apply for a lot of our own judgment to that. We really go with where the industry tells us they're going, and we got to see how the year plays out. I think we feel good about the business. Some of the restructuring did was reflective of where the volume growth is and where the volume growth isn't. But the business is in a healthy place, and the margins have been doing better as we've come out of all the sort of the post-COVID world and the volumes will be obviously consistent with global auto OEM numbers."", 'Peter John Skibitski', ""Okay. Got it. And then I had a couple of questions on Aviation. Are you expecting Caravan sales deliveries to be up in '24? I know you delivered a lot of them to Asia, and we're seeing some softness in China. So just wondering what you're seeing there?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Look, Peter, I mean we're not going to get into model-by-model. But I would say net of everything, the turboprop market is doing really, really well. As you know, that does tend to be a little bit more international. I think we usually give the numbers, roughly 60% international versus the jet side is 80%. But I think our Turboprop business is in a really good place. I think caravans will do well. I think carriers are going to be strong. We continue to ramp on the Sky carrier. So we tend to get most of the questions around Jet. But look, I think the turboprop business is in a very good place, and we certainly net expect to see that business continue to grow in 2024."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to the question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cohen.', 'Cai von Rumohr', ""Yes. So Scott, at Bell, are you looking for -- is part of the profit strength this year '24 coming from closeouts on the V-22 and the H1? And secondly, is there any risk to FLRAA volume from an extended CRR?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""So Cai, look, I think the 2024 -- obviously, we'll see some contracts come to an end, and there will be some MR release when you do that. But look, I think we can execute well on that pro forma. I mean, I think Q4 is a good example, Cai. We had about $8 million total in the company of EACs that's not a particularly material number and it's flat on a year-over-year basis. So do I think we'll have some reserve release next year? Sure, we will. I mean, we normally do as we perform through these programs. But I think the cost out activity that we've been driving, the absorption and growth on both the commercial revenue side as well as the FLRAA revenue side will all help to contribute to preserving and getting a good margin rate for 2024. And in terms of the -- I'm sorry, in terms of the CRR. Okay, I think we're okay. I mean, as we've talked about before, if the CRR goes all the way through a full year, that could put some pressure for sure. I think the Army probably has backup plans, they're trying to work in terms of how they would move money around. Obviously, FLRAA is a very high priority, very important program to them as well. So the whole thing would be a heck of a lot easier if Congress would just pass the budget for sure. But right now, I think we're okay unless it really goes to a full year, I think we'll collectively between ourselves and the Army to be able to manage through it."", 'Cai von Rumohr', 'Got it. And last one, at Aviation. Can you give us some color in terms of where the order strength is in terms of fractionals versus high net worth versus corporate?', 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""It's pretty stable, Cai. We aren't really seeing a change from where we were. We don't break all that out, obviously, but it's -- the demand has been pretty strong. In terms of mix, as you know, the jet stuff tends to be more domestic, roughly 80-20, the turboprop is more like 60-40 international, we haven't seen big changes in that. We haven't seen big changes in the mix between what goes through the fractional world and what goes through the whole aircraft side, end demand continues to be, we think, pretty strong across the board."", 'Operator', 'Next, we go to a question from Doug Harned with Bernstein.', 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""Scott, in the past, you commented on the supply chain that you'd actually seen more challenges at Bell than you had in Aviation. And given the strong margins at Bell, I mean, can you comment on where that stands today?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, look, I listed the challenge of the world we're listening, right? I mean, we had some pretty significant impacts at Bell in the earlier part of the year around a very small number of suppliers, a couple of those suppliers either got healthier. In some cases, we brought stuff inside and exited those suppliers. So when you do that, we had a situation of Bell with a couple of the aircraft models where we had very specific supply issues that we were able to resolve. And as a result, Q4 had a pretty strong delivery number on a year-over-year basis. So again, this is the challenge. So while the absolute number of parts might be getting less, you can still have a part problem that has a significant impact. So that's just the nature of the beast and what our guys work through every day. So I think we did resolve a couple of critical issues in the latter part of the year at Bell that enabled those higher deliveries. And obviously, we've got to keep working."", 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""And then if I go back to the Aviation side and the end market, 1 of the things we've seen is more preowned airplanes out there for sale, higher percentage. We're still not back at kind of historical norms. But you were commenting that you're seeing a little bit less pricing benefit relative to inflation. I mean are you seeing any potential pressure here from pre-owned and as you look at your market?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""No, we're not. Look, I think it's -- look, first of all, as you noted, it's up versus where it was, which was at ridiculously low levels. It's still at historically lower levels than normal. And we keep a very close eye on this. They're mostly much older aircraft, right? So the phenomenon that people kind of refer back to say, geez, you have aircraft competing with new aircraft sales. Obviously, there was a time, going back a number of years ago now, where you have relatively new aircraft that we're coming onto the market. And we're just -- we're not seeing that dynamic. When we look at what's out there, what's available for sale in the used market, the number is increasing, but they are considerably older and in large part, out of production aircraft. So, no, we're not really seeing an impact of used aircraft out there that are competing with new aircraft sales."", 'Operator', 'And next, we go to Gavin Parsons with UBS.', 'Gavin Eric Parsons', ""I just wanted to circle back to industrial margins and just get a better sense for what's driving that, given I think context had been the section segment underperforming. And then just on, it seems like in TSV, some of your recreational vehicle competitors are having headwinds. So what's driving the margins and growth there?"", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, look, I mean, every -- we look at those end markets, be it in the auto side or in the vehicle side. And our view is, as I said, I think, overall, the industrial will be pretty flat, but with improved margins. And that's largely, again, based on just industry forecast, we think Caltex volumes will be down somewhat, although we think margins will continue to improve in that business. On the vehicle side, I think we'll see modest growth, and that is because we do factor in some of these higher dollar discretionary items. We don't expect to see growth in that area. But net of all of that, the business probably still see some modest growth, and again, continued performance on the margin line. So those things that you guys might aggregate and look at in terms of other guys in that market are completely consistent with what we're seeing. But again, that is absolutely factored into our guide."", 'Gavin Eric Parsons', ""That's helpful. And maybe just circling back to the NetJets 1,500 over 15 years. I think typically, they firm up about a year out. But on average, that would be 100 deliveries a year. Is that something you need more visibility from them on over a decade of orders? Or..."", 'Scott C. Donnelly', ""Well, we don't. And you're right. So we -- the way we treat the backlog is when those firm up and that is roughly 12 months, where they actually put deposits down, that's the point at which we move those aircraft into actual backlog. In terms of looking out beyond that, we do absolutely work closely with them on forecasting what that demand is going to look like even outside of that 1-year firm up period. So we certainly have very, very good dialogue and working with them to collectively anticipate what that demand is going to be on the fractional side. But then we don't firm up and put into that actual backlog number until roughly, as you said, that 1-year window."", 'Operator', 'And ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, this conference is available for digitized replay and will be available after 10 a.m. Eastern Time today through January 24, 2025.

One of these worth taking a look at is blue-chip company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The beverage giant hit a 52-week low on Oct. 6, but has since bounced back. Even so, shares are still off a 52-week high of $64.99 reached last April.', 'Does this mean Coca-Cola is a buy? Should investors who already own shares sell with the current rise in stock price, or continue to hold?', ""Coca-Cola's revenue experienced a rough patch during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, but as these restrictions receded, the company's sales reversed course and began an upward trajectory. Now, Coca-Cola is delivering solid financial results."", ""For example, in its third quarter, the company experienced 8% year-over-year revenue growth to $12 billion. Net income also rose in the quarter to $3.1 billion from the prior year's $2.8 billion."", ""Coca-Cola expects full-year 2023 results to deliver at least 10% year-over-year organic revenue growth. That's an increase from last February's original guidance of a minimum 7% growth. The company reports 2023 full-year results on Feb. 13."", ""Coca-Cola's revenue resurgence is thanks to a strategy focused on improving the company's return on invested capital. For instance, Coca-Cola pared back its portfolio of beverage brands from around 400 to 200, allowing it to concentrate on the products with strong revenue and profit growth. Although accounting for about half the company's product portfolio, the eliminated brands represented only 1% of revenue."", ""Another factor helping Coca-Cola is that it's a global business. If one region shows soft sales, as seen in China during Q3, strength in other regions can offset this shortfall, as was the case with Latin America, India, and Southeast Asia in the quarter."", ""In addition, the company's multi-year path to refranchising its bottling operations is helping Coca-Cola's financial health. This strategy enables the company to move away from this capital-intensive, low-margin business by selling the operations to local bottling partners."", ""In Q3, Coca-Cola entered into an agreement to refranchise its Philippines bottler, paring down the company's bottling operations to just India, Oman, Africa, and a handful of locations in Southeast Asia. Coca-Cola once held bottling operations around the world, including in the U.S."", ""Back in 2015, this bottling business accounted for over 50% of net revenue, and the company's return on invested capital was about 17%. Thanks to refranchising, bottling operations now comprise less than 20% of net revenue; yet, Coca-Cola's return on invested capital has risen to over 23%."", ""Coca-Cola's strategies have helped its financial performance, and one key financial area important to investors is the company's free cash flow (FCF). FCF provides insight into the cash available to invest in the business, pay debt obligations, and repurchase shares or fund dividends."", ""And Coca-Cola's dividend is a compelling reason to buy and hold shares. The company has increased its dividend annually for an impressive 61 consecutive years, and possesses a solid yield of 3% at the time of this writing."", ""Through three quarters, Coca-Cola's FCF was $7.9 billion, a $636 million increase over the previous year's FCF of $7.3 billion. The company paid out $4.1 billion in dividends during that time, so FCF was ample enough to cover the dividend payout."", 'Another consideration in deciding whether to buy, hold, or sell Coca-Cola shares is the assessment of Wall Street analysts. Among this group, the average price target for Coca-Cola stock is currently $65.49, and the consensus is an overweight stock rating. So Wall Street is recommending to buy shares.', ""That's understandable, considering that Coca-Cola's strategies for success, such as its streamlined product portfolio, are generating good financial results. Moreover, the company expects double-digit organic revenue growth for 2023, which is excellent, and its dividend looks secure given FCF is rising."", 'All things considered, this would be a good time to buy Coca-Cola shares -- and then hold on to them to collect the solid dividend.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Coca-Cola Consolidated's (NASDAQ:COKE) look very promising so lets take a look."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Coca-Cola Consolidated is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.25 = US$824m ÷ (US$4.1b - US$908m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Coca-Cola Consolidated has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated ', ""Historical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you'd like to look at how Coca-Cola Consolidated has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""We like the trends that we're seeing from Coca-Cola Consolidated. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 25%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 29% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", ""In summary, it's great to see that Coca-Cola Consolidated can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 319% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."", ""Like most companies, Coca-Cola Consolidated does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of."", ""Coca-Cola Consolidated is not the only stock earning high returns.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""As you can see below, at the end of September 2023, Waste Management had US$14.7b of debt, up from US$13.4b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. Net debt is about the same, since the it doesn't have much cash."", 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Waste Management had liabilities of US$4.22b due within a year, and liabilities of US$20.8b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$150.0m and US$2.92b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$21.9b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because Waste Management is worth a massive US$74.7b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Waste Management has net debt to EBITDA of 2.6 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. On the plus side, its EBIT was 7.5 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 2.6. We saw Waste Management grow its EBIT by 7.8% in the last twelve months. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Waste Management's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Waste Management recorded free cash flow worth 63% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""Waste Management's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was a real positive on this analysis, as was its interest cover. On the other hand, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little less comfortable about its debt. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Waste Management is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

The company owned or operated 337 transfer stations at the end of 2022, a number that will be updated when it reports results for the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""Waste Management owned or operated 259 sites in its landfill network at the end of 2022. All of these sites require proper permitting from various government entities, which can be hard to get initially. But once obtained, this can be a competitive advantage -- it's difficult for a competitor to come in and steal business."", ""The revenue Waste Management generates from collecting trash as well as operating landfills and transfer stations is the bulk of its business, as one would expect. But the company's landfills surprisingly have more value than meets the eye. And through 2026, management expects more than half of its profit growth to come from extracting this hidden value."", 'What exactly is that value? Read on.', ""The company hauls tons of waste to landfills, where it all just sits. Well, it doesn't just sit -- it also decomposes. And as a result of the decomposition, the garbage releases what are called landfill gasses (LFGs)."", ""LFG can be harvested to produce electricity, and that's exactly what the company has been doing. But it can also be refined into renewable natural gas (RNG) to power vehicles or sell to third parties. This is what the company is prioritizing right now."", ""Waste Management built five facilities between 2015 and 2022 to convert LFG to RNG. And through 2026, it's building 20 more. This is resulting in high capital expenditures for the company -- the total bill is expected to be around $1.2 billion. But the payoff is expected to be substantial. Indeed, Waste Management believes that its RNG facilities will be generating $450 million in annual free cash flow in 2026 and beyond."", 'Allow me to put that number into perspective. If not for all of its capital expenditures right now, Waste Management would be generating about $2.5 billion in annual free cash flow. However, management believes it can add $580 million in free cash flow once its current investments start paying off. Of this, $450 million will come from its investments in RNG.', 'In other words, about 78% of incremental free cash flow will come from turning landfill gasses into RNG, which is something that you might not expect at all.', 'Over the years, Waste Management has consistently grown its profits, leaving it with more options for creating shareholder value. Two of its most frequent decisions are repurchasing shares and paying a dividend. The chart below shows the long-term trend.', 'In December, the company announced that it was increasing its dividend for the 21st consecutive year, placing it in elite territory.', ""As already mentioned, Waste Management's core business is rock-solid, and the company is competitively well-positioned. And it has a viable path to profit growth as it takes better advantage of something that's already at its disposal: landfill gasses. And that should boost shareholder value, making this a good stock to buy and hold today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Waste Management right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Waste Management, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Waste Management wasn't one of them.

With net sales increasing to $21.4 billion, a 3% rise from the previous year, PG demonstrates its ability to grow amidst challenging market conditions. Despite a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion for the Gillette brand, operating income remained strong at $4.4 billion. The company's ability to navigate through currency devaluations and market contractions, particularly in the context of the Russia-Ukraine War, is indicative of its resilient operational strategy."", ""Brand Equity and Market Leadership: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) continues to benefit from its powerful brand portfolio, with leading names like Tide, Charmin, Pantene, and Pampers contributing to a loyal customer base and consistent revenue streams. The company's brand strength is reflected in its ability to command premium pricing, resulting in a gross margin increase of 520 basis points to 52.7% of net sales. This pricing power, coupled with manufacturing productivity savings and lower commodity costs, has fortified PG's market position against competitors."", ""Financial Health and Diversified Portfolio: PG's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet, with net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble standing at $3.468 billion. The company's diversified product portfolio across Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments ensures a balanced revenue mix, reducing reliance on any single product category and mitigating risks associated with market fluctuations."", ""Brand Impairment and Restructuring Costs: The impairment charge related to the Gillette brand highlights vulnerabilities in PG's portfolio. The $1.3 billion charge reflects challenges such as increased competition in the grooming segment, currency devaluation, and macroeconomic pressures. Additionally, the company anticipates restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax, primarily due to foreign currency translation losses, indicating potential weaknesses in its international operations."", 'Operational Inefficiencies: While PG has demonstrated manufacturing productivity, there are areas of operational inefficiency that need attention. The unchanged unit volume and mix, along with a mid-single-digit increase in SG&A spending, suggest that there is room for improvement in optimizing operational costs and enhancing overall efficiency.', 'Digital Transformation and E-commerce Growth: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) has the opportunity to further capitalize on the digital transformation and the growth of e-commerce. With consumers increasingly turning to online shopping, PG can leverage its strong brand presence to enhance digital marketing strategies and expand its e-commerce footprint, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue growth.', ""Expansion in Emerging Markets: PG's presence in approximately 180 countries positions it well to tap into emerging markets, where rising consumer incomes and demand for quality consumer goods present significant growth opportunities. Strategic investments in these regions could drive long-term growth, offsetting slower growth in more mature markets."", ""Intense Competition and Market Saturation: The consumer goods industry is highly competitive, with PG facing competition from both global brands and local players. Market saturation in certain segments could lead to price wars and margin compression, challenging PG's profitability and market share."", ""Geopolitical Tensions and Economic Uncertainty: Geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, and broader economic uncertainties pose significant threats to PG's operations. These factors can lead to currency fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer behavior, potentially impacting PG's financial performance."", ""In conclusion, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) exhibits a strong foundation with its diverse brand portfolio and solid financial performance. However, the company must navigate brand impairment challenges, operational inefficiencies, and intense competition. Opportunities in digital transformation and emerging markets are promising, but geopolitical and economic threats loom. PG's strategic focus on innovation, market expansion, and operational excellence will be crucial in maintaining its industry leadership and driving future growth."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(FFO)', 'FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended in December 2018, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.', ""The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including the Company's ability to make cash distributions."", 'Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)', ""FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as FFO plus non-real estate depreciation, allowance for straight line credit loss, adjustment for straight line operating lease rent, non-cash deferred compensation, and pro-rata adjustments for these items from the Company's unconsolidated JVs, less straight line rental income, free rent net of amortization, second cycle tenant improvement and leasing costs, and recurring capital expenditures."", 'FAD is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is not indicative of cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. FAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure with respect to liquidity because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company’s ability to fund its dividends. Because all companies do not calculate FAD the same way, the presentation of FAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. FAD does not represent cash flow from operating, investing and finance activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.', 'Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre)', ""EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures."", 'The Company presents EBITDAre because the Company believes that EBITDAre, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt.

Cash NOI is also a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by subtracting free rent (net of amortization), straight-line rent, and the amortization of acquired above and below-market leases from NOI, while adding operating lease straight-line adjustment and the allowance for straight-line tenant credit loss.', ""The Company presents NOI and Cash NOI because the Company believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and reconciliations, provide investors with meaningful information regarding the operating performance of properties. When operating performance is compared across multiple periods, the investor is provided with information not immediately apparent from net income that is determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI and Cash NOI provide information on trends in the revenue generated and expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties, unaffected by the cost of leverage, straight-line adjustments, depreciation, amortization, and other net income components. The Company uses these metrics internally as performance measures. None of these measures is an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and same-store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance."", 'Coverage Ratios', 'The Company presents fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios to provide a measure of the Company’s financial flexibility to service current debt amortization, interest expense and operating lease rent from current cash net operating income. These coverage ratios represent a common measure of the Company’s ability to service fixed cash payments; however, these ratios are not used as an alternative to cash flow from operating, financing and investing activities (determined in accordance with GAAP).', 'SLG-EARN', '']"

Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI), a preeminent force in the U.S. homebuilding sector, disclosed its financial performance through the 10-Q filing for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The company reported revenues of $7.726 billion, a notable increase from $7.258 billion in the same period the previous year. Net income attributable to D.R. Horton Inc stood at $947.4 million, slightly down from $958.7 million. Despite a minor dip in net income, the company's basic and diluted net income per common share saw an increase, indicating a continued profitability and shareholder value. However, the cash flow statement reveals a net cash used in operating activities of $(153.4) million, a stark contrast to the $829.1 million provided by operating activities in the prior year, signaling potential liquidity concerns."", ""Market Leadership and Revenue Growth: D.R. Horton Inc's leading position in the homebuilding industry is underscored by its expansive operations across 118 markets in 33 states. The company's revenue growth, from $7.258 billion to $7.726 billion in the reported quarter, demonstrates its ability to capitalize on market demand and maintain a strong sales trajectory. This growth is a testament to D.R. Horton Inc's brand reputation and its strategic market segmentation, catering to a diverse customer base including entry-level, move-up, and luxury buyers, as well as active adults."", ""Financial Services Synergy: The company's financial services segment provides a competitive edge by offering mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers. This integration not only streamlines the homebuying process for customers but also contributes to D.R. Horton Inc's revenue streams, enhancing overall financial stability and customer retention."", 'Inventory Management: The increase in construction in progress and finished homes, coupled with a rise in residential land and lots developed, indicates a significant investment in inventory. While this positions D.R. Horton Inc to meet potential demand, it also exposes the company to risks associated with carrying high levels of inventory, such as increased carrying costs and potential for impairment in the event of a market downturn.', ""Cash Flow Concerns: The shift from a positive cash flow in operating activities to a negative one raises concerns about D.R. Horton Inc's liquidity management. The company's increased investment in rental properties and other assets, alongside a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale, suggests a need for closer scrutiny of cash flow management to ensure sustained operational efficiency and financial health."", ""Market Expansion: D.R. Horton Inc's established presence in numerous markets presents opportunities for further geographic expansion and market penetration. By leveraging its brand and operational expertise, the company can explore new regions and demographics, potentially driving future growth and diversification of its revenue base."", ""Housing Demand Dynamics: With a growing population and changing demographics, there is an inherent opportunity for D.R. Horton Inc to capitalize on the long-term demand for housing. The company's focus on a range of buyer segments positions it well to cater to varying needs, from first-time homebuyers to retirees looking for active adult communities."", ""Economic Sensitivity: The homebuilding industry is highly susceptible to economic cycles. Factors such as rising interest rates, inflation, and unemployment can adversely affect homebuyer confidence and demand, posing a threat to D.R. Horton Inc's sales and profitability. The company must navigate these macroeconomic challenges carefully to maintain its market position."", 'Competitive Landscape: D.R. Horton Inc operates in a competitive industry where it faces constant pressure from other large national builders and local competitors. To maintain its edge, the company must continue to innovate in home design, construction efficiency, and customer service, while also managing costs effectively.', ""In conclusion, D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) exhibits a strong market presence and revenue growth, bolstered by its integrated financial services. However, the company must address its inventory management and cash flow challenges to sustain its competitive advantage. Opportunities for expansion and the persistent demand for housing offer promising avenues for growth, but economic fluctuations and a competitive landscape remain significant threats. D.R. Horton Inc's strategic focus on operational efficiency, market responsiveness, and customer-centric offerings will be crucial in leveraging its strengths and opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

All comparisons are to the full year and fourth quarter of the prior year, unless otherwise noted.', 'SUMMARY', 'Consolidated net sales increased 4.1% in the year to a record $23.05 billion', 'Net sales from stores in the Paint Stores Group open more than twelve calendar months increased 6.8% in the year', 'Diluted net income per share increased 19.8% to $9.25 per share in the year compared to $7.72 per share in the full year 2022', 'Adjusted diluted net income per share increased to $10.35 per share in the year compared to $8.73 per share in the full year 2022', 'Diluted net income per share decreased 6.1% to $1.39 per share and adjusted diluted net income per share decreased 4.2% to $1.81 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023', 'Generated net operating cash of $3.52 billion, or 15.3% of net sales, in the year', 'Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) increased 17.5% in the year to $4.24 billion or 18.4% of net sales', 'Full year 2024 diluted net income per share guidance in the range of $10.05 to $10.55 per share, including acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share', 'Full year 2024 adjusted diluted net income per share guidance in the range of $10.85 to $11.35 per share', 'CEO REMARKS', '""Sherwin-Williams delivered solid fourth quarter results, with positive sales growth and significant year-over-year gross margin improvement,"" said President and Chief Executive Officer, Heidi G. Petz. ""We continued our accelerated growth investments in the quarter, which we are confident will continue to drive profitable above-market growth in future periods. Sales in all three reportable segments were within or better than our guidance. In our architectural businesses, commercial and residential repaint were the strongest performers, while DIY remained challenging. In our industrial businesses, growth varied by division and region, reflecting ongoing choppiness in the market. Paint Stores Group and Performance Coatings Group segment margins expanded year over year.', '""For the full year, sales grew to a record $23.05 billion, gross margin expanded to 46.7% (which is well within our current targeted range) and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 18.6% to a record $10.35 per share. We generated strong net operating cash in the year, which enabled us to continue to invest in customer-focused innovation, while returning $2.06 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a segment perspective, Paint Stores Group overcame a difficult demand environment characterized by challenging conditions in new residential and existing home sales markets to deliver high-single digit percentage growth against a low-teens comparison, while also expanding its segment margin. Consumer Brands Group faced weak DIY demand, but grew in its targeted Pros Who Paint market and completed the divestiture of non-core aerosol product lines and its China architectural business. Performance Coatings Group generated sales growth in a market that was highly variable by region and business, further integrated recent acquisitions and delivered strong adjusted segment margin.""', '\xa0', 'FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS', '', '', 'Three Months Ended December 31,', '', '2023', '', '2022', '', '$ Change', '', '% Change', 'Net sales', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 5,252.2', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 5,230.5', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 21.7', '', '0.4\xa0%', 'Income before income taxes', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 474.0', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 494.9', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (20.9)', '', '(4.2)\xa0%', 'As a % of net sales', '9.0\xa0%', '', '9.5\xa0%', '', '', '', '', 'Net income per share - diluted', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1.39', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1.48', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (0.09)', '', '(6.1)\xa0%', 'Adjusted net income per share - diluted', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1.81', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 1.89', '', '$\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (0.08)', '', '(4.2)\xa0%', '\xa0', 'Consolidated net sales increased primarily due to an increase in Paint Stores Group net sales volume.

We expect Auto Refinish and Protective & Marine demand to remain strong and gradual improvement in Industrial Wood and Packaging, with less clarity in General Industrial. As we look at our entire cost basket, we see modest raw material deflation, though continued escalation of wages and other costs has led us to implement a 5% price increase in Paint Stores Group effective February 1.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the importance of payout ratios, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios.\xa0', ""Investors have traditionally shown a strong preference for dividend stocks because of their ability to generate income. When seeking stocks that provide a steady income stream, investors often lean toward companies that have a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time. Such companies typically maintain low payout ratios, indicating robust cash generation capabilities. Payout ratio is a measure indicating the percentage of a company's net income or free cash flow that is distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it implies that the company has the potential to sustain or even increase its dividend payments in the future. Adam Kramer, who oversees the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund, discussed payout ratios in a report. Here is what he said:"", '""It\'s important to analyze the stability of a company’s cash flows when assessing the level of payout. When the payout ratio is more than 50%, you always stress test that ratio.""', 'A high payout ratio indicates that a company is allocating a substantial portion of its earnings towards dividend payments, resulting in a reduced amount of funds available for potential investments in the future growth of the business. In a study conducted by Wellington Management, dividend-paying stocks were categorized into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, known as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, included the lowest dividend payers. The second quintile stocks showed better performance than the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods from 1930 to 2022, while the first and third quintile stocks tied for the second place, outperforming the Index 67% of the time.', ""The study revealed that the success of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks could be attributed to the sustainability issues associated with the excessive dividend payouts of the first quintile. Additionally, the average dividend-payout ratio since 1979 for the first two quintiles of dividend payers within the Russell 1000 Index was highlighted in the study. The first-quintile stocks had an average dividend payout ratio of 74%, while the second quintile had a more moderate 40% average payout ratio. Maintaining a high payout ratio, such as 74%, may pose challenges for a company if it undergoes a decline in earnings. In such circumstances, the company might be compelled to reduce its dividend, a move often interpreted in financial markets as a sign of weakness. This reduction frequently leads to a decline in the company's stock price."", 'Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best MLP dividend stocks with sustainable payout ratios discussed among others in this article.', 'Photo by Scott Graham on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds as of Q3 2023 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 30%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care.

We'll start the call with some opening comments from Richard and then we'll go through the slide presentation materials and then open up the call for questions. So I'll turn it over to Richard."", 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Okay. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, our first quarter was really a sound quarter and outstanding in several respects in terms of our operations. It was really led by PT-FI during the whole year of 2023. We began our ramp-up in 2019 of the underground, and now we are fully operationally and the team has been setting records consistently out there and it just outperformed for the full year and faces some really challenges, which is just part of that business. But I'm very proud of our PT-FI team at job site in Jakarta. We are making great progress in fulfilling our 2018 commitment to the government to invest in down streaming and the copper concentrate business. In December, I was there for the inauguration of the expansion of the older smelter, PT Smelting, with President, Joko Widodo, and that was a good event. And then with our new smelter at Manyar in Eastern Java, we reached an important 90% milestone at the end of the year, and we're progressing for physical completion of the smelter and ramping it up on schedule in 2024. A couple of words about the markets. It continues to be the micro versus macro story. Notably, in 2023, the macro factors strengthen notably, 2023 had long been forecasted to be a year of surplus because of new mines coming on stream, but it ended up being a small deficit, and at the same time there were stronger-than-expected demand for copper in the United States and in China in spite all the issues of China's property business, other sectors created notable growth for copper in China. Then there were the supply shortfalls throughout the industry for some significant mines and these for range of factors that are kind of common to our business. The copper business -- mining business is a tough business, but it was political issues in some countries, community issues, and then operating issues. As a result of all that, inventories of copper around the world are at historically low levels and the inventory levels are really inconsistent with the current copper price. The copper price clearly been driven by macroeconomic factors. The currency, the strong U.S. dollar carryover effects of inflation, government fiscal policies. And there are concerns about economies in China and Europe. But if the macro outlook -- and I'll just say when the macro outlook improves, watch out for the copper price. Looking ahead, the world is going to need significantly more copper in the future for a variety of factors. The world is becoming increasingly electrified, and that's what copper is used for. And it's at a time when the industry is simply not investing to grow production, that the outlook indicates that will be required for economic, operational and resource nationalism, a series of factors, but the facts are there's an outlook for strong demand and supply challenges. That's why I'm so personally confident about where Freeport is positioned and pleased with it. We have high-volume existing production that's sustainable. We have large sustainable reserves and resources. We have growth opportunities that we will pursue prudently from this really exciting Leaching initiatives that Kathleen will be talking about, and from brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. Before turning over to Kathleen, I just want to send a note of condolences to our friends at Rio Tinto. You may have seen the news, but they had a (inaudible) to go down in Canada heading to their diamond operations there. Rio has been a special part of Freeport's history, of course, through our partners for many years at Grasberg. I've worked with 6, 7, 8 CEOs of my career, some of my closest colleagues have been with that company. And the toughest part of being a CEO is to lose people, and I'm just so sad to hear this news and the whole Freeport families' heart goes out to our friends at Rio. With that, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you."", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Okay. Thank you, Richard, and I'll be covering the presentation materials, starting with Slide 3. Our achievements for 2023 are summarized here. Our sharp focus on executing our plans in an effective, safe, and responsible manner, managing the controllable drivers and navigating challenges successfully all translated into solid operating results over the year. A big highlight for the year was the outstanding progress in Indonesia, where we grew production levels for the fourth year in a row. We posted several new operating records and we continue to enhance values for this large-scale, low-cost, and [long-last] resource. We were also successful in reaching several milestones during the year, including our -- reaching our target run rate for incremental leach production in the Americas, enhancing optionality in the Americas for our brownfield growth projects, and reaching our targeted 90% completion milestone for the Indonesian smelter project by the end of 2023. As a leader in the industry, we were one of the first companies to have all of our operating sites certified under the Copper and Molybdenum Marks, and this demonstrates our performance and commitment to responsible mining practices. We ended the year 2023 in a strong financial position, a positive outlook, and as we work together to enhance long-term value for shareholders. On Slide 4, we summarize the key results for 2023 compared with historical levels. After growing our volumes from 2020 to 2021 and 2022, we were able to (inaudible) production of copper in 2023 despite a challenging environment for copper supplies, Richard discussed, and we reported another year of growth in gold production. Our unit net cash costs for 2023 were above the 2022 level as expected, but they came in very close to our original guidance for the year. We're continuing to actively manage costs and productivity initiatives to address cost inflation, and we'll be working on that as we go forward. For the year 2023, we generated strong EBITDA of $8.8 billion and operating cash flows of over $5 billion. We're continuing to carefully manage not only our operating costs but also capital expenditures with a priority on spending on projects to sustain production, improve efficiencies and enhance optionality for future development options with attractive rates of return. During 2023, we returned $860 million to shareholders, bringing the total shareholder returns to $3.8 billion since we implemented our performance-based payout framework in 2021. We ended the year with net debt of approximately $800 million, and that excludes the smelter-related debt, which is being financed separately. I will move to Slide 5 and talk about the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our sales were 3% above our estimates going into the quarter. Our gold production was also very strong, but our shipments have grown in the fourth quarter was slightly below the previous estimates, and that reflected timing in these shipments we made in the first quarter. Unit net cash cost averaged $1.52 per pound in the fourth quarter, that was better than our guidance of $1.58 per pound, and slightly below the year ago period. Notably, unit net cash costs Indonesia were 0 in the fourth quarter, $0.00 per pound, meaning our gold credits completely offset the production cost for copper. Average capital realizations in the fourth quarter were $3.81 per pound, and we generated $2.3 billion of EBITDA and operating cash flows of $1.3 billion. If you go around the world and talk a little bit about our various operations in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we made progress in increasing our mining rates. That's been a big focus during the quarter with a 9% increase over the year ago quarter. We have a continued focus on improving our asset efficiencies and workforce experience levels. These are important initiatives as we seek to increase productivities to combat lower ore grades. Our innovative leach initiatives met expectations and also helped to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades in the U.S. Labor market conditions in the U.S. continue to be tight. We're taking steps to expand housing options in our remote locations for recruiting and retention, and we're also continuing to pursue technology solutions to enhance productivity. Conversion of the Bagdad truck fleet to fully autonomous is advancing, and we're targeting to commence the transition in the second half of next year. In South America, our ore milled was sustained above 400,000 metric tons per day, and our ore stacking rates increased at a (inaudible). Mill recoveries at Cerro Verde in the fourth quarter of 2023 were below the year ago level because of the material types that we're mining in the fourth quarter. This is continuing for mining phases in early 2024, and we're working to optimize performance. As Richard discussed, the fourth quarter performance in Indonesia was exceptional. Underground ore mined averaged over 214,000 tons per day, and that was 8% higher than the year ago period combined with strong wage and recoveries, our copper and gold production in the fourth quarter was over 20% higher than last year's fourth quarter. We completed the installation of a new SAG mill at PT-FI in December, and that will provide additional opportunities for us going forward. And the team is just doing outstanding work, sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. We thought it's good to look back in history of how the underground transition has gone, Slide 6 covers this. We show a history of the progression of the transition. As Richard mentioned, we stopped mining from the surface in the Grasberg Open Pit at the end of 2019, transition to fully underground operations beginning in 2020. We have a long history in Indonesia, spanning over 56 years, and a great track record for building value over many years for all stakeholders. We're extremely proud of the team's execution, our transition. We now have the world's largest underground mining complex, and it's been developed in a modern, efficient operation. The Grasberg is the world's second largest copper mine and one of the largest gold mines even though gold is a byproduct. High grades of both copper and gold make it one of the lowest cost operations in the world as well. This took a lot of planning. We began planning for this underground era over 25 years ago and commenced development activities in 2004. And as you can see from the graph, the project is performing exceptionally well and generating strong margins and cash flows. As we look forward, we're continuing to make investments in this resource to enhance value and sustain long-term performance. We're working on the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 and increasingly confident about securing our long-term rights. And that would extend the lives of our resources and open a whole new set of opportunities for this district. Richard touched on the smelter progress, and this is really important for us in terms of securing long-term rights. We reached 2 important milestones on these initiatives in 2023. The projects include a new greenfield smelter in East Java, and the expansion of our nearby existing smelter, which was developed in the late 1990s. Richard mentioned, we celebrated in December, the completion of the expansion project with the Indonesian government and our Japanese partner. And we also reached a really important milestone on progress of the greenfield project with completion progress achieving the target we set with the government of over 90% by the end of December. We posted a video this morning on our website that shows the Greenfield Smelter project. You can see all the progress that's been made and you can see the sheer size and scale of this impressive facility, and I hope you'll have a chance to look at it. Both projects have been executed very efficiently in the context of a challenging market for major project development. The internal team that we have working on this project, together with our contractor, have done an outstanding job containing costs and maintaining schedules. We're working to complete the construction by the end of May of 2024 and to start commissioning and conduct the ramp-up period over the balance of 2024. This is a big deal for us. It's not very frequent that you see new smelters starting up, and we've done a lot of planning going into the start-up process. Our teams are well-prepared and really highly motivated to achieve a safe, efficient, and timely start-up in 2024. Turning to the U.S. and the Americas where we've got an important leach initiative ongoing, we achieved our targeted run rate where we were targeting approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year by the end of 2023. This is an exciting and innovative initiative involving new operating practices being applied to our traditional leach operations and really working to get more out of our massive stockpiles that contain material that has in place in prior years. Look, remember, as we've talked about on prior calls, the cost of this incremental cost of production is lower from both an operating and capital perspective because we're targeting material where the material has already been mined, and we're largely using existing infrastructure to extract the new metal. The first phase of this initiative essentially involved 4 basic categories of actions: One, as we've talked about previously, we commenced the process to install coverage over the stockpiles to increase heat retention and drive higher recoveries. Two, we gained access to areas in the stockpiles that have not previously had the benefit of leach solution and this initiative we call Leach Everywhere. Three, we started using drilling techniques to specifically target areas within the stockpile where solution was lacking. And importantly, the fourth area is developing more sophisticated models using data analytics to optimize the application of solutions to improve performance and using this data as a valuable tool in getting work in all the areas of initiatives in this important program. As we look at where the impacts came from, you can see most of the incremental production was from our Morenci mine. That mine has a very long history of leaching operations. We have a massive set of stockpiles there and a very large opportunity set at Morenci. As we go to Phase 2 of the project, where we are working to essentially double the initial target from 200 million pounds to 400 million pounds, we really are looking at just scaling these practices further. And by continuing to scale the operating practices, we think we can double the initial target over the next 2 to 3 years. And as we continue to work to sustain the production we can add to our reserve position, and that's a real focus of ours, to capitalize the progress into long-term reserve additions. The first and second phase of this initiative is really operationally driven using existing technologies. The third phase, which is also very exciting is really the work that we and others are doing to advance the leaching process using different additives and different techniques, and this is more of an R&D effort, but it's being advanced. We're commencing a large-scale testing activity to evaluate the response to new additives and we're also evaluating opportunities to get more heat retention in our stockpiles and heat really is an enabler of more copper production and higher recoveries. In aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum, and that's equivalent to a large-scale copper mine. And notably, it's got very low capital intensity, and we've seen how much -- how much new copper mines cost. This is a very low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs, and a low carbon footprint. The value potential here is very attractive, particularly for a company like Freeport to take advantage of given our large quantities of suitable material that we previously mined. Richard touched on copper markets earlier, and we have some information on Slide 9. Physical markets have continued to tighten, inventories have declined and demand is growing. Despite the weak sentiment over the last several quarters on the Chinese economy and property sector, the reality is that China's copper consumption was strong throughout 2023. And this reflected the intensity of copper use and energy infrastructure, renewables, and electric vehicles. In the U.S., our customers continue to report solid demand for copper with growth in several sectors. At the same time, supply disruption increased meaningfully in recent months. In total, near-term supplies of copper have been reduced by over 700,000 tons in a very short period of time. The market was previously expecting that 2024 would be a small surplus market and in turning to deficit beginning in 2025 time frame and continuing for some time. With the recent supply disruptions and continued demand growth, the deficit market has been advanced into 2024, setting up for tight market conditions in the near term. While the fundamentals have become significantly more positive, macro conditions tied to U.S. dollar strength and sentiment about China have influenced copper price movements. Richard mentioned, we believe the fundamentals of the market will lead to significantly higher copper prices in the future, and that's supported by anticipated strong growth in demand associated with secular trends, and the global economy's requirements for copper. Also, the realities of the cost and time frames required for new supply development is an important factor when we look at the fundamental outlook for copper. Turning into how Freeport is positioning to try to grow production in response to this market demand, really look at the sizable on Slide 10. We really look at the sizable reserve position of copper and even larger resource position that Freeport has that supports a pipeline for future growth options. Within the portfolio, we look for opportunities to get more out of what we have through innovation and operating efficiencies. We look for investments and projects, so we have large resource positions and where we have established track records and opportunities to launch the existing infrastructure, our people and capabilities, all with the drive focus on increasing value. We categorized on Slide 10, our near-term, medium-term, and longer-term development options. And we've outlined identified projects totaling about 1.7 billion pounds of copper in the Americas. And we've also highlighted on the slide the ongoing development of the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia which is expected to support long-term production profiles in the Grasberg District. The opportunities that are shown on the slide in the 2- to 3-year category, they center around scaling our rich initiatives and achieving incremental production from our operational improvement projects. Together, the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds of incremental copper per annum and do not require significant investment or long lead times. We discussed earlier that the leach projects, but we're also dedicating significant resources to enhancing productivity and asset efficiencies, rebuilding the experience of our workforce given the large number of new hires in recent years, and utilizing new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened somewhat during the pandemic. As we indicated, we completed the feasibility study late in the year 2023, to evaluate a project to more than double the size of our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona. The reserves at Bagdad are span for decades, and they support expansion of infrastructure at the site to bring value forward. The incremental capital cost to build a new concentrator and support infrastructure for significantly higher mining and milling rates is on the order of $3.5 billion and an expanded operation would not only substantially increase copper production but would produce economies of scale and reduce unit costs. The project does not require major permitting and it's relatively straightforward. But given the tight labor market conditions and general market factors, we're not making a decision right now on the timing of the project. We'll continue to evaluate the timing of when we would go forward. But we are taking steps now to enhance optionality for the future by making some investments in the autonomous haulage for our mining operations, making some investments in housing, and also advancing investments in the tailings infrastructure that will put us in a position when we make the decision, we could get the project online within a few years. In Chile, at El Abra, we talked about this. Our resource is very large. We have a major opportunity to install a new concentrator on the size of -- on the order of magnitude size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde in 2015. We'll continue to work to retest the economics and updating our project capital costs in light of recent capital cost experience of other large projects and in parallel, we're starting work in preparation for an environmental impact statement that would give us the ability to advance the project and provide optionality for future development. We mentioned Kucing Liar development project in the Grasberg district, which we've initiated development on. This is a multiyear development project, and it's proceeding on schedule, and we expect to commenced production by 2030, ramping up to over 500 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold. We're also conducting additional exploration in the Grasberg district, where we have identified potential -- we've got a big potential below our Deep MLZ ore body and we expect to have additional opportunities in the future at Grasberg. We have a major opportunity in the U.S. at the Safford/Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. This year, we're going to work to complete metallurgical testing, and mine planning, and start our prefeasibility study to assess future development options there. We continue to see this district as one that has big potential and potentially being a cornerstone asset in the U.S. on adjacent to the Morenci operations. In Indonesia, we're focused on this extension of our rights beyond 2041, because that would open up a substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and a continuation of the large-scale mining in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We're in a really strong position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value to shareholders. With a lot of history in developing big projects, we included a slide on Page 11 that you can take a look at a key strength of our company is the ability to execute projects successfully. This does not come easy. It requires a focused hands-on approach and we've got a business model of pairing internal resources with trusted contractors, and that has served us well. We've listed several projects that we've led over the years, and we've developed very complex projects around the world. We're going to continue to approach future projects with the same level of preparedness rigor and a focus on execution. As we look at 2024, turning to Slide 12, we've got our focus area is listed here. And first and foremost, we remain committed to safe and reliable execution of our operating plans across the global business. Seems like a simple thing, but this involves discipline and hard work day in and day out. We discussed our focus on enhancing performance in the U.S. through our leach initiatives and productivity. This is particularly important to mitigate low grades and to manage costs, which experienced higher inflation in recent years. We're going to have another big year in Indonesia. A key priority for us is to complete the smelter and ramp up safely and efficiently and to finalize an agreement for extension of our long-term operating rights. We're also very focused on enhancing optionality, definition, and the value of our embedded growth options. On Slide 13, we show, as usual, we show a 3-year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold, and molybdenum. For 2024, the copper sales volumes are slightly reduced, less than 2% below our prior estimate and are now expected to be similar to 2023 levels. The gold sales are 10% higher than our prior estimate and higher than they were in 2023. Buyer sales in Indonesia for the year of 2024 offset by slightly lower sales from the Americas. In 2025, our sales estimates are similar to the prior estimates and we've added 2026 estimates, what you can see are slightly above the 2025 levels. For 2024, we currently estimate our consolidated unit costs to approximate $1.60 per pound. We've got some details in the reference materials. I believe, on Page 30 that you can look at the composition of those costs but $1.60 very similar to what we had in 2023. On Slide 14, we put together our projected volumes and cost projections, and we model the results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These models use the average of 2025 and 2026, and our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and holding gold flat at roughly current levels of $2,000 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $19 per pound. And you can see here on the charts that annual EBITDA in these periods would range from $10 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper, and operating cash flows under these price scenarios to range from $7 billion to over $10 billion. And we've got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right-hand side of the chart, really well positioned with a lot of lot reserves, large-scale production. We not only have current exposure to copper, but all of our future projects and growth opportunities are well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth, and this will give us the ability to generate returns on projects and enhance cash returns under our performance-based payout framework. Turning to the capital expenditures. On Slide 15, we show our current forecast for '24 and '25. We should also show where we ended up for '23, which totaled $3.1 billion, and that was slightly lower than what we had guided to in October of $3.2 billion and capital for 2024 is currently forecast of approximately $3.6 billion compared with $3.9 billion preciously. The 2025 estimates that are new here are currently estimated to total $3.8 billion. That includes $1.2 billion in discretionary growth projects, which totaled $2.4 billion over the 2024 and 2025 years. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects, to generate returns that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value-enhancing projects that are detailed in the reference materials on Slide 33. We're going to continue to be very disciplined around capital expenditures, carefully managing those. You saw we adjusted the capital expenditures down for 2024. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at opportunities to do things to sustain our business and to do things on a low capital intensity basis. And finally, before we take your questions, we -- just on Slide 16, we reiterate our financial policies, and those are prioritized centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and a lot of flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. You may have seen that Moody's upgraded our credit rating in December, and that just demonstrates our strong financial profile. Indicated on the slide, we've distributed almost $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since the payout framework was implemented in the second half of 2021, and we have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value, long-term value for shareholders. The global team as we go forward is really highly focused on our strategy of being foremost in copper, and we're driven to continue pursuing long-term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely, and efficiently. And I want to thank everybody for their attention, and we'll now take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.', 'Alexander Nicholas Hacking', 'I guess my question is around Bagdad and the technical study. Now I was a little surprised by how high the CapEx was $3.5 billion or an incremental 100,000 tons, about $35,000 a ton. I mean, in your view, is that the new normal for a concentrate project? Or are there particular factors the fact that are raising the CapEx above historical levels?', 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Thank you, Alex. I think it is somewhat of a new normal for the cost of a concentrator and related mining infrastructure. When you do -- you're dividing on the cost per ton, you're looking at how many pounds of copper are going to come out of that concentrator. And our U.S. mines are characterized by relatively low ore grades. And Bagdad has relatively low copper ore grades but also has molybdenum kicker. So molybdenum would add something like 10 million pounds of molybdenum with an expansion. So that will be another benefit. But really, what we need to do is focus on -- it does bring down our overall cost per pound. So that's a big plus for us. When you look at an investment in the U.S., it may be to develop a relatively low grade mine, but something important to point out is that we don't have the tax burden in the U.S. that you have in the international location. So I think our projects in the U.S., while they're low grade, when you cut through all the economics and you look at the ability for us to -- to execute the projects and look at the risk associated with them -- the different than looking at a project in a different location. So there's some pluses or minuses that go into the bottom line. But we started this work on Bagdad some time ago, and we've updated all of the capital costs in line with where current capital costs are. And so I think a reality of the market is that the incentive price to develop new copper, even if it's brownfield, is much higher than it has been in the past. And that's another reason why we believe that the markets that they need, these copper units are going to have to adjust to the incentive prices required to get these projects going because we don't want to front-run the market. We want to be prepared, we want to be have options to go forward as soon as we can, but we don't want to be in a position where we're investing in making major capital commitments before the market prices are challenge to us already."", 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Yes, Alex. Let me just add very brief very briefly that Kathleen makes a really good point about these relative economics. No royalties in the U.S., U.S. tax rate is much lower -- federal tax rates much lower than outside the U.S. We have a net operating loss carryforward. Community support is strong in the U.S. and we have no minority interest there. So looking at global benchmarks needs to be adjusted for the site-specific factors that we have in the U.S., and they're very positive."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.', 'Carlos De Alba', 'Question is on cost. I just want to see if you can provide a little bit more color? The guidance for the first quarter of net unit cash cost of $1.55 per pound looked very, very good relative to consensus stations and our own estimate. However, for the full year, the guidance came at $1.60, and that is a little bit higher than the market -- than again, consensus and our model suggests. What are you expecting? What the viability in this were you surprised in -- at the beginning of the year then maybe throughout the rest of the quarters is increasing. What is driving that? And to what extent this number for the year is conservative?', 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""In terms of the first quarter, we do have some gold that was not shipped in the fourth quarter that will be shipped in the first quarter. And so the relative gold-to-copper ratio impacts the first quarter and makes that less than what we expect the average to be for the full year. I don't know what Carlos, what you had in there for export duties, but we're assuming in Indonesia that those are continuing. We are continuing to discuss with the government of Indonesia, the applicability of those duties. And I think the more that we make progress on the smelter the better our case there is. But that we factored into the estimate, but we are continuing to have that discussion. So if we are successful in reducing those duties, that would be a benefit."", 'Carlos De Alba', 'All right. And just to clarify this, Kathleen. The cash cost guidance for the year, of $1.60, includes that the duties in Indonesia concentrate exports remain throughout the entire of the year, right, the full year?', 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Yes. Our export -- it only applies to export volumes. And so as we go through the year, the exports will decline because we'll be ramping up the smelter. So our goal for 2024 is to get the full ramp-up completed. And so that's not something that will continue long term, the duties, once we get the smelter up and running. But it will start to decline over the course of the second half as we ramp up and we produce more domestically."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies.', 'Christopher LaFemina', ""Richard and Kathleen, I wanted to ask about the kind of cost trends in North America, in particular, at Morenci. So I know that you're guiding to a slight increase in your site production delivery costs in 2024. And I assume that is a function of volumes being lower. But if we think about kind of where this business could be headed assuming that Morenci can kind of get back to where it was 12 or 18 months ago. And I'm not sure if that's a good assumption, but let's assume that to be the case. With the leaching ramp up with the staffing and productivity improvements within technologies, and potentially even longer term with the Bagdad expansion, where could that kind of site production and delivery cost number trend down to? Could it get back to $2.50 or lower? Or is $3 a pound sort of the new normal for that business?"", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Well, we hope it's not the -- Chris. We're working hard. I mean one of the things that you've got to take into account here is we are in a low grade period in the U.S. I think the grades that we had in 2023 were the lowest that they had been in probably 10 years or so or more. So we are in a period, and that's continued to '24 where we do have some low grade that we're going through. But that is why it's so important for us to bring on units with a lower incremental cost and the leach opportunity will help us there. And as we are able to get those pounds put into reserves longer term, not just what you're mining that year or getting that year, but multiyear reserve additions for the leach that spreads the cost -- all the costs over more reserves. And so it does help us with driving the economies of scale and why it's so important. We're not in a position now to say where costs could go. There's been a number of other factors that we have, inflation factors and things like the cost of basic parts and materials and supplies, has gone up from where it was just 2 or 3 years ago. But we are very focused on it. And -- all of these self-help things for us have very high rates of return. There's not a lot of capital involved. It's focused resources. It's not an easy thing because it would have been done already, but it is an area we think we can make improvements. We can also focus, which we're doing now on the last couple of years, we've had to rely more on contractors because of the staffing issues but as we get staffing set up and get more experience in the workforce, we can reduce our reliance on contractors, as you probably know, have gotten expensive, and in Arizona is a very competitive market. So we're working on all those things within the things that we have within our control and are really going to be focused on trying to drive the cost down. We're also looking at Morenci specifically at different configurations. We're looking at whether it makes sense for us to be operating all of our equipment like we are today and looking at if we cut back some things would that be the cost and benefits to that because that could have volume impacts as well. But is that a better setup, a more efficient setup that will allow us to drive costs lower. So we've got some of those initiatives that are -- they are being reviewed right now on what the right setup is given how costs have risen."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.', 'Orest Wowkodaw', ""Given the cost -- the capital costs involved and the timing of building new projects, and the strength of your balance sheet, I'm just wondering whether M&A of producing assets is something that's on the radar because it certainly seems like there could be some assets available out there, especially in jurisdictions or not currently in?"", 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Well, we're constantly monitoring the market and you can be confident that opportunities are available are presented to us, and we consider them. The facts we haven't found those attractive today. We have such great opportunities to create value totally for our shareholders by focusing on internal growth, through the leach project, through the brownfield developments in the Americas, through the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia, and now with the expectation that we'll go beyond 2041, we're going to do additional exploration there to understand what the opportunities are. Success in any of those opportunities creates value where there's no value in our current share price. So it's all for the best of our shareholders. And that makes it much more difficult for external opportunities to compete with them. And my experience has shown that small mines get smaller and big mines get bigger. So we really are -- as I said in my opening comments, pleased about where Freeport is positioned for what we believe is going to be a great future for our company."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Edward Goldsmith with Deutsche Bank.', 'Edward Goldsmith', 'Two questions from my side. So firstly, can you give an update on the status of the negotiations over a concentrate export extension post May? And secondly, can you outline the reductions to the 2024 CapEx? I think they were the discretionary and the other CapEx bucket level.', 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Yes. On the first part of the question, our current export license in Indonesia goes to May of 2024. And we are continually having discussions with the government of Indonesia about the fact that while we will be substantially complete on construction activities by the end of May, which was really important target for us and for them that just the ordinary course of a smelter start-up, it takes 5 or 6 months to get through. And so we're having those discussions. They understand the situation, and they're encouraging us to continue to meet our targets and that those discussions will continue. (inaudible) that the alignment that we have with the 51% ownership of the state-owned company, MIND ID, in PT-FI's operations is really important here. That, combined with tax revenues, et cetera, that the government gets from having consistent operations at PT-FI is we're both aligned in that to have exports continue. So the conversations have been constructive to date, but we've just got to -- we've got to continue to progress it. And have those -- continuing to have the discussions with the government, and we're doing that on a regular basis."", 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Well. Kathleen, just let me add. They're not negotiations over this issue. The mine -- I mean I've spoken in recent months on at least 3 occasions directly with the President about it. He understands it, the Mines' Minister who has the business background clearly understands it. It's just administrative procedurally, they concluded not to grant that export rights beyond this date to see if we complete the smelter as we've committed to do it. But beyond that, it will be just be an administrative action to get it approved."", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""On the second question with respect to capital expenditures. We always go through a process of looking for opportunities to put out capital if it's not required in the current year, and we went through a process between the last update on this one to really look hard at what we could efficiently spend this year and cut back on some things. Some of that showing up in 2025. We'll do the same thing again because really what we want to do is deploy the capital as efficiently as we can and make sure we're sustaining the reliability of our operations, but also looking at -- we don't want to be doing too many things at one time. And so we always take a hard look at it. So we'll continue to do that as we go forward and manage the capital very carefully. But there wasn't really one big thing. There was a number of things that we did and looking at the prior estimate for 2024."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.', 'Michael Stephan Dudas', ""With regard to your proposed investments in the U.S., maybe looking in Latin America, maybe you care to remind us on an internal rate of return, risk-adjusted rate return basis, what Freeport is looking for? Certainly, you mentioned, on the U.S. investments, you get benefits from royalty and tax issues. But just on a general basis, even when you're thinking about your assets in Indonesia. And then the follow-up on that, is the industry relative to a year ago today? Is the industry ahead of the curve or behind the curve on meeting what the expected demand opportunities are in the market?"", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""On the first part of the question, with respect to how we evaluate projects and returns, we don't target one number. We look at what the specific project is, what the execution risk is, where it's located. And we run a range of commodity price assumptions around it to look at -- what we're really focused on in deploying capital is investing and putting our infrastructure and investments in places where we can execute the plan and in places where we've got long-term reserves because anybody that tells you they can get the copper price right is wrong because it's going to move up and down. And so what we want to have is a situation where we've got a very long life reserve where you can make that capital investment upfront and realize cash flows over a long period of time and not have to get the price forecast for copper perfect in the first year or 2. And so when we look at returns, we're looking at those projects that have leverage to future copper. And we may -- we look at something that is outside of the U.S., we may apply higher risk factors and we look to get higher rates of return than what we would want to have in something like the U.S. where for reasons that Richard talked about, have somewhat of a lower risk profile for us. But it is not one scientific number. It's a range of scenarios that we run around a project. And again, looking at the resource and the size of the investment and our ability to generate returns over a long period of time, that would be consistent, not that it would go away -- it would fall off something that could be earned over a long period of time, has a long tail, which a lot of our projects do. And Richard might have some perspectives on the second question. I think it's obvious that there haven't been new projects sanctioned in our industry for some time. And what's happened recently in recent years with the copper prices rallying and then falling off has just caused more delays, more cautiousness by developers in developing the project. So I would say, in my opinion, the situation has become more significant because the projects are taking longer, not shorter. And we talked about when we started on Grasberg Underground, we started planning -- started investing 20 years ago in it. I mean we really have -- these are long lead time projects, and we really need to have started investments. And that's why we're really focused on what can we do to continue to plan for these long-term projects. So what else can we do and what can we do to take advantage of technology that's available to us? And what can we do to get more out of the resources we already have? But not everybody has that ability. And Richard, I don't know if you want to add any comments to that second part."", 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Well, I'll add a brief comment to the first part too, Kathleen. The -- my early experience in my career was in the oil and gas industry. And early on, Dan Yergin and I wrote a paper on oil price forecasting which basically evidenced how wrong forecasts can be. And so we approach, as Kathleen described, all of our investment and business planning on a scenario basis, not trying to predict a particular price or range but to look at what impact investment decisions and operating decisions have on our overall portfolio. And we look to protect ourselves on a portfolio basis from downside risk and then structure investments to take advantage of what we have is confidence in the long-term price. So it's not any kind of formal rate of return kind of criteria that you see in a lot of industries, which work elsewhere. Have the saying that figures don't lie but lie is figure. And we just really base these things, as I said, on scenario planning and portfolio impacts. The basic thesis, I believe, for the demand for copper is unchanged and continues to be supported. From the very start, my work with ICMM, its Chairman from 2 occasions, but more recently when all the issues about aspirational goals for carbon reductions were being considered in such promise, I've always said that there are a lot of unanswered questions and the movement towards these aspirational goals will not be consistent, but they'll have issues, complications and so forth, and that's certainly what we're seeing. The future of copper is really influenced significantly by investments in carbon reduction. And I think it's something the world absolutely has to do. There are other factors related to global growth, connectivity, these data centers, some of that's being driven by artificial intelligence. Just everywhere you turn, the world is getting more electrified. And that's why I think the fundamental long-term demand thesis for copper is just getting stronger and stronger."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.', 'Brian MacArthur', ""It goes back to what Alex was asking in Bagdad. So I just want to make sure, as I look at these numbers. So the project capital is $3.5 billion. And I would have to think you get some infrastructure benefit there, so it's not a true greenfield. And then you talk about a $3.50 to $4 incentive copper prices, and I understand the benefits of new royalties and taxes. Does that sort of say that if you didn't have infrastructure, the capital costs would have been higher? And if you didn't have all these tax benefits, the incentive price would be an awful lot higher, i.e., if anybody else had to do a greenfield there, you'd probably need an incentive price well over $4 to make it work, i.e., those numbers include all the tax benefits and everything that you were talking about before, if I can ask the question that way."", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', 'Brian, the -- if somebody else has the same situation, greenfield and the grades we have, it would be a lot more expensive.', 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""A lot more. Your $4 is absolutely right. I mean you just look at recent projects and look at how costs escalate and then what would have taken from an incentive price to justify that project from the outset if the cost numbers have been known. So this is not that complicated. It's not a greenfield project. We've operated there for 80 years or so. And it's about a straightforward project as you could have, but it's telling for the industry even with this kind of straightforward project, the challenge you face. It's cost, it's tailings, and we do benefit from infrastructure. This is just a mill expansion. It's not a building a new mine, but then there's a challenge of getting workers and housing for workers. So all of this is real telling on the supply side. I just talked about the demand side support for copper. This is a great example of a simple project in terms of the relative complexities of projects in our industry, this is relatively simple. And yet, it faces these challenges of being an economically justified in today's price. At the outset, I said today's copper price is not -- the price is adequate to stimulate the kind of investments that are going to be needed for this industry. And that's why we're optimistic about future prices."", 'Brian MacArthur', ""Right. And maybe if I could just ask just on the capital allocation. I mean, you've got lots of options, as you said. But if you're successful for Phase 3, I mean you get as much production there as you would hear, I assume a fraction of the capital cost. Does Bagdad get pushed in that situation? I mean, I get that the world needs probably all of it. But would they get sequenced or are they complementary? I mean, I know they don't depend on each other, but are they complementary? And you would do both at once if both work?"", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""We're prioritizing the leach initiative. I mean that is one that's a no-brainer for us. It's very, very little capital that we're investing in it and very low increment -- it's our lowest incremental operating cost of anything in the U.S. And so that's a no-brainer. We're pursuing that regardless. That makes a ton of sense, and we're pursuing that regardless. We think the world is going to need something beyond that, obviously. And so on the Bagdad thing, we just want to get it to where -- continue to enhance the optionality in it, and we need to do some things anyway. We're doing some infrastructure on tailings that we would need to do anyway in the future, maybe not as quickly as what it would need with the new project, but we need to do those anyway. So we're going to do those to the extent we can do that efficiently. We want this autonomous thing that we're pursuing. Years ago, people thought you didn't really need autonomous in the U.S. But now we -- particularly in these remote locations, you really, really do when you consider the cost of the workforce and the housing limitations and that sort of thing and the opportunities to upscale our employees, we think it checks all of those boxes. So autonomous, we want that to see how that unfolds. So we don't have to pull the trigger on Bagdad now but we want to put it in a position where it can go forward. It makes sense if the world needs more copper to get copper from where we already have it. And so it does -- it's a good project. It's not a barn burner from an economic standpoint, right now, but will have it today. And I think it will get time at some point. It's just we aren't predicting exactly when."", 'Richard C. Adkerson', 'And Brian, we got a strong enough financial position that we can -- capital is not a barrier for us to do in projects that make sense.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Alan Spence with BNP Paribas.', 'Alan Henri Spence', '(inaudible)', 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Alan, you're breaking up on us."", 'Alan Henri Spence', ""Sorry, I'll try again. Hopefully, you can hear me."", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Yes, that's better."", 'Alan Henri Spence', ""The strong performance for Grasberg in December, is that a level you think could potentially be through '24?

Adkerson', ""We've got a great -- Go ahead, Kathleen."", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""Okay. I was going to say Mark Johnson is on the line, he can add to it. If you want with respect to December, what highlights, we got that SAG mill completed in December. So really, that gave us the ability to put more or throughput through the concentrators. And with the combination of higher grades and strong recoveries, we had a great month. Now we have the ability to continue to have strong performance. We achieved a lot of records in December but we do have the ability and some upside to continue that. That SAG mill was originally put in the plan because over time, we'll need the additional grinding capacity, et cetera, to take the ore that will be coming but right now, while we're in these higher-grade sections, the more we can put through the mills, the better the copper production will be. In terms of the $240 million, right now, we don't have $240 million in our plans. But over time, with the addition of Kucing Liar, we'll have that capacity to do it. But having SAG3 does give us some more opportunities in the near term to -- if we continue to have high rates of ore produced from the underground will give us some upside. A mine, we don't talk a lot about but one that we're going to try to keep improving on is the Big Gossan mine. It's a relatively small mine, but very, very high grade. And we've got some plans to bring in some additional and that's reflected in the 5-year guidance, but some additional throughput from Big Gossan that will add copper production and gold production. And Mark, I don't know if you want to add to any of those comments."", 'Mark J. Johnson', ""Yes. Kathleen, the only thing I would add is as part of the KL project, we also add some -- over the shorter term, we had some ore flow capacity and optionality at GBC. We -- that allows us to get GBC up from like 120,000 up to 140,000 tonnes a day in 2026. And at that point, we'll be able to run close to 240,000 tonnes through the mill. The mine and mill will be matched. And then as you said, the KL come up and then GBC and KL share portions of the ore flow system, but over the short term, we sequenced that part of the KL ore flow that gives us the opportunity at GBC in the much shorter term."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.', 'William Chapman Peterson', ""Nice job on the quarterly execution. Thanks for sneaking in my question here. So I wanted to come back to the leaching efforts, the incremental 200 million pounds. I think you mentioned 2- to 3-year period. Is that a 30 (inaudible) ramp? Or is that more back-end weighted? And you've consistently talked about low capital intensity. Can you remind us what the capital associated with this is, I guess, quantified? And has there been any CapEx creep in interim similar to just other broader projects?"", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""On the time frame for the incremental 200, we have not given a specific time frame. We do feel we can get it done within a couple of years, and we'll add whatever we can in the interim. This Leach Everywhere initiative that we have, where we are accessing parts of stockpiles that hadn't been accessed before getting access to some of the side slopes and some of the areas around the stockpile that we just didn't leach before. We're -- that's been a big driver of success and will continue to be. The other one that we're excited about is the targeted drilling. And through our data, we can see where you have situations where the solution that needs to get to the ore has been blocked for some reason over history. And this targeted drilling allows us to get access to it. We are testing this year, some abilities to do that more at scale. And that is something that we're really interested to see how that develops and whether that will give us some additional incremental production. We haven't factored that into our plans at this point. But we're going to continue to use these covers. We still don't have everything on the -- stockpiles are so massive, covering -- spanning particularly Morenci, just miles of area. And so we're still doing the covers. We're still looking for other opportunities to get heat into the stockpiles. We're targeting some pyrite ores in some of our operations that have pyrite in the ores, that is a source of heat as well. But there are a number of things that we're working on that are not the big R&D effort, but things that we can do from an operational standpoint. But we'll stay tuned. We will -- this is a big initiative and stay tuned as we go forward, love to give you a little bit more as we go through 2024 in terms of the time frame. We haven't spent much capital on this initiative. We've already got the infrastructure -- basic infrastructure, the tank house capacity, this is copper that goes to tank house, not a smelter. And we have already excess latent tank house capacity. We've spent some money but it doesn't round to anything really big. The operating cost -- the incremental operating costs of this have been very low on the order of $1 per pound and so it's just a really, really exciting opportunity for us to generate value. And so as we go forward, we don't see huge amounts of capital either that will come into play. When you get to this piece that's R&D, that's where we need to make sure that all these things can be applied and deployed at scale and can be economic. But that is just ongoing. But the first 400 million pounds, we think that we can do that without spending a lot of capital."", 'Richard C. Adkerson', ""Thanks, Kathleen. And you may have noted this, Kathleen, but importantly, there's no permitting issues.

One would just be on the current level of the dividend. I mean, is your view that given the cash flow outlook, your view of the copper price, I mean, is this a comfortable level for the dividend for 2024? And then just my half question would be, is there any movement within your existing TCRC contracts to potentially renegotiate those or get the benefit of some of the really, really low spot pricing we're seeing today?"", 'Kathleen Lynne Quirk', ""On the dividend question, our Board reviews the financial policy on a regular basis, and we put in place the base dividend, the variable dividend, and we've been paying at that level for some time now. We'll continue to review that with the Board.

So I don't want to front-run anything. The Board will look at this on a regular basis, but our financial position is in really, really excellent shape. The second question on TCRCs, we reach agreement, as you know, with -- on long-term TCRCs that are done on fixed contracts once a year. And since then, spot rates have come a lot, lot lower given the tightness in supply. We do sell some things on a spot basis, but most of it is sold under these fixed contracts where we have the TCRCs fixed. The other thing is once we get the smelter in Indonesia up and running, we don't have -- we still do what Cerro -- still have with Cerro Verde concentrate that we sell.
