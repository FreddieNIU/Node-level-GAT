For more top AI stocks, head on over to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. The hottest trend in technology right now is artificial intelligence. This is simply due to the fact that for the general consumer, artificial intelligence is mostly associated with sci-fi grade technology with the potential to create entities with human like intelligence and response. However, until most of 2022, such technologies were not available to captivate the public attention. Most chatbots were rather rudimentary and lacked the ability to provide detailed responses.However, all this changed with the release of ChatGPT, a conversational assistant trained on vast amounts of data and capable of generating human like responses to queries. ChatGPT set the internet on fire, and within days and weeks after its initial and public release, all tech and non tech publications were simply gushing about the assistant. As is the case with hype, it often goes far beyond what logic might suggest, and soon we were being warned that professionals such as lawyers might have to switch careers as a virtual assistant can provide better services.All this hype has made everyone forget what artificial intelligence really is. Simply put, AI is the use of complex mathematical techniques to use a set of inputs, plug them in an equation, and then determine the most likely set of outcomes. So, if you ask ChatGPT about companies with reusable rockets, it will sift through its data to determine which are the most likely matches and likely give you an answer that includes SpaceX.This utility of using large scale data analysis to generate a likely set of outputs provides artificial intelligence with far more utility than a simple chatbot. One of the best use cases of artificial intelligence that does not involve talking is autonomous driving. This involves feeding a computer in a car data through a variety of sensors such as LiDAR sensors, and programming it in such a way that it is able to make decisions that mimic human behavior like knowing when to stop and when to turn. Building on this, the consulting firm McKinsey takes a look at other sectors that can use AI. Its report for the 2022 use cases for AI shows that a variety of sectors such as robotic process automation, knowledge graphs, facial recognition, and recommender systems are using artificial intelligence as well. Functionally speaking, McKinsey reports that the largest users of artificial intelligence are service operators, customer service analytics, and customer generation and lead generation platforms.Story continuesOne firm that leads in the customer services arena is Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). It provides customer engagement and analytics platforms. During its earnings call for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023, its executives shared the inside scoop on Salesforce's Einstein GPT - the world's first generative language artificial intelligence platform for customer relationship management and details for other plans to integrate AI into the overall business.During the event, they shared:EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack. And then there’s another way we’re opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customers’, as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, I’ve been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while it’s inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldn’t be more excited about the future. To wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. We’re making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well.Given these explosive use cases, it's important to look at a wide list of firms currently developing and deploying the AI technology. Some topics AI picks from hedge funds include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best AI stocks, we first made a list of all firms that are developing and have deployed the technology.

2,ffad6628-b795-37ea-92f0-80b60a9b441a,SCHW,2023-05-25,Should Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-small-company-102009471.html,1685010009,STORY,"['^RUT', 'SCHW']","[Designed to provide broad exposure to the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $5.99 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueSmall cap companies have market capitalization below $2 billion. They usually have higher potential than large and mid cap companies with stocks but higher risk.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.58%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 20.70% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Visteon Corp (VC) accounts for about 0.44% of total assets, followed by Ssc Government Mm Gvmxx (GVMXX) and Sylvamo Corp (SLVM).The top 10 holdings account for about 3.04% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF return is roughly 0.39% so far this year and is down about -0.13% in the last one year (as of 05/25/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $53.63.The ETF has a beta of 1.19 and standard deviation of 24.03% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1005 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, FNDA is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $10.68 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $23.02 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3,3e7f81b4-a78a-3857-8ba9-c2e4e34e85d0,TXN,2023-05-25,Texas Instruments Will Benefit From the Artificial Intelligence Boom,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-benefit-artificial-intelligence-164903013.html,1684946943,STORY,['TXN'],"[Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has been underperforming the Nasdaq Composite year-to-date with gains of nearly 3% versus the index's gains of 20%. Does this huge gap signal potential problems for this technology company? Perhaps in the near-term, but I would argue that there is a lot of hidden value for Texas Instruments for three main reasons: growth in the free cash flow, a strong dividend and artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with TXN. Click here to check it out. TXN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TXNPeter Lynch Chart of TXNTexas Instruments Will Benefit From the Artificial Intelligence BoomTexas Instruments has a remarkable free cash flow trend Rich Templeton, chairman of the board at Texas Instryments, once stated that, The best measure to judge a companys performance over time is growth of free cash flow per share, and we believe thats what drives long-term value for our owners.""I cannot agree more. Free cash flow is one of my favorite financial metrics as it connects two basic elements together, profitability and valuation. Free cash flow has the net income component among its equation, and when a company generates positive free cash, it can use it for many business purposes, including to pay off debt, increase the dividend, invest it back in its business, or even explore acquiring another company that will drive growth higher. High and sustainable free cash flow generation thus has great potential to lead to higher valuations for a stock assuming there is no stock dilution.Texas Instruments has delivered very strong free cash flow growth historically, with cash flow acheiving an 11% annualized growth for the period of 2004 to 2022. At the same time, there has been a 47% reduction in share count as the company consistently bought back shares. This is the kind of shareholder focus that value investors love to see, showing management is very committed to the stock price performance. With the combination of share buybacks and business growth, Texas Instruments has seen its share price grow from $26 back in 2004 to approximately $170 as of this writing.Story continuesThe balance sheet is healthy and dividend growth is stableTexas Instruments has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.66, which is reasonable, and an interest coverage ratio of 40.9, which is very healthy and strong. The dividends per share have been stable in the past 10 years and have also been increasing. The payout ratio of approximately 53% is safe and leaves room for further dividend increases.Texas Instruments Will Benefit From the Artificial Intelligence BoomTXN Data by GuruFocusTexas Instruments is well-positioned to benefit from AIAI and semiconductors have a mutually beneficial relationship, with each field enhancing the capabilities and potential of the other. Thus, Texas Instruments has a huge opportunity to benefit from the growing AI trend.AI algorithms often require massive amounts of computational power to process and analyze vast amounts of data. Semiconductors, especially specialized processors like graphics processing units (GPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), deliver the high-performance computing needed to accelerate AI tasks such as deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision. These processors are designed to handle parallel processing and perform complex calculations efficiently, improving the speed and efficiency of AI systems.Semiconductors play a crucial role in improving the energy efficiency of AI applications. Low-power semiconductor designs, such as system-on-chips (SoCs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), enable the deployment of AI algorithms in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, edge computing devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By optimizing power consumption, semiconductors help extend battery life, reduce operational costs and make AI more accessible in various domains.Training deep neural networks, a key component of AI, requires significant computational resources. Semiconductors designed for AI workloads, such as GPUs and ASICs, enable faster training times by parallelizing computations across multiple cores. Similarly, during the inference stage, where AI models make predictions on new data, specialized chips like tensor processing units (TPUs) offer accelerated performance and reduced latency, enabling real-time AI applications. Other benefits worth mentioning are customization and flexibility, edge computing and IoT applications and advanced sensor integration.The combination of AI and advanced semiconductors has facilitated the deployment of AI algorithms directly on edge devices in real-time. This is particularly important in applications where low latency, privacy, or bandwidth constraints exist, such as autonomous vehicles, smart cameras and industrial IoT. Semiconductors enable on-device processing, reducing the need for constant data transmission to the cloud, improving response times and enhancing privacy and security.Of course, not every semiconductor company makes the best products. It's still a highly competitive field, but a rising boat lifts all tides, and in any case, Texas Instruments has some key areas of expertise. For example, the company boasts that its vision processors are excellent for AI applications.ConclusionOverall, Texas Instruments has a solid history of value creation, and it is clear the management is dedicated to shareholder returns. Combined with the long-term growth potential of AI, I believe the stock looks attractive at this time and has the potential to reward patient investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

STNE and Varex Imaging Corp. VREX.5 Valuable Price-to-Book Stocks to Boost Your PortfolioIt’s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than their actual worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.For narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank, General Motors, Unum Group, StoneCo Ltd. and Varex Imaging Corp. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000:A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

These Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-prologis-properties-tenants-164620400.html,1684946780,STORY,"['PLD', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'FDX', 'HD']","[When investors buy real estate investment trusts (REITs), they aren’t just buying real estate companies. They also are buying the tenants that comprise the REITs leasing portfolio.Before you decide to buy any REIT, consider the stability and solvency of its tenant base. Consider these questions: Are any tenants facing bankruptcy or closing a large number of locations? Are the tenants high quality? Are the tenants diversified, not only geographically but also by industry? And finally, what is the percentage of each tenant’s annual base rent (ABR) in the total tenant portfolio?Take a look at one well-known retail REIT and consider the questions raised above in evaluating its merits. Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owners and manages approximately 1.2 billion square feet in just under 5,500 industrial logistics properties throughout the U.S. and 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, the company has long been a leader in appreciation among REIT stocks.In addition to leasing space through a program known as the Essentials Platform, Prologis supplies equipment, robotics and other services to its customers to enhance business operations.Prologis is the largest REIT by market capitalization, with a cap rate of $13.02 billion and has been a stalwart among REITs for the last 25 years. During that time, it has a total return of 571.39% for those taking dividends and 1,282.25% for investors who reinvest the dividends. Its 2023 year-to-date total return is 11.01%.Through the years, Prologis has been known as a growth-oriented REIT rather than for having a high-yielding dividend. But over the past five years, Prologis has increased its quarterly dividend by 81.25% from $0.48 to $0.87 per share. The $3.48 annual dividend yields 2.84%.One of Prologis’s strengths is the diversity of its portfolio in geographical location, types of goods, industries and the percentage of ABR per tenant. The chart below shows the top 10 tenants as well as the diversification of goods in Prologis’s buildings:Story continuesYou can also see the geographic diversity of its portfolio net operating income (NOI) from the chart below:Geographic diversity reduces risks Prologis would develop should any one area of the world fall into recession. But because 86% of Prologis’s NOI comes from the U.S., it remains its most important geographic region by far.Prologis gets high marks for its stable-to-increasing occupancy rates and customer retention over the past year, but despite its first-quarter 2023 occupancy rate of 98%, there was a slight drop in the rate from the fourth quarter of 2022 and a more troubling 5.2% drop in customer retention.Whether this is the beginning of a downward trend in occupancy and retention or just a one-quarter anomaly remains to be seen. From the chart below, it’s noteworthy that the occupancy and retention rates are higher than they were in the first quarter of 2022 and that its occupancy rates throughout the rest of the world are stable and in the mid- to upper-90th percentile.Below is a chart showing the geographic breakdown of each area of the U.S. and other countries by square feet, occupancy and leased percentage. One minor concern is the percentage of total square feet being leased in the three large metropolitan areas of Southern California, New Jersey/New York City and Chicago. Together, these areas make up over 26% of Prologis’s total square footage in the U.S. But because the demand for industrial space in large urban areas is far greater at the present time than it is for office space, this may not be a problem going forward.Prologis’ top customers are some of the largest and most well-known companies in the world. The list includes Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD), FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT). This means consistency and stability when it comes to rent collections.One recent concern is that Amazon currently leases 5.2% of Prologis’s total square feet. Between 2020 to 2021, Amazon purchased over $450 million in industrial space and land with the intent to downsize the amount of space that it leases from Prologis and other industrial REITs.During Prologis’ second-quarter 2022 conference call, the executives were asked about Amazon’s announcement that it would be unloading a great deal of leased space because of overcapacity. Prologis responded that it was 99% occupied in areas where Amazon was leasing space and that existing rents were 54% below market, so finding new tenants would not be difficult should Amazon terminate its leases.Keep in mind that Amazon was renting about 33.4 million square feet from Prologis. While finding new tenants could be easy, there is often significant expense and lost revenue from the time a large tenant leaves until a new tenant moves in. New buildouts, carrying costs and rent incentives could significantly impact Prologis’ bottom line.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketTenant ProfilesIn addition to Amazon, other large tenants in Prologis’ portfolio include:Home Depot Inc. is Prologis’ second-largest tenant with 1.7% of its ABR. Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. and one of the most successful companies in America over the 45 years since its inception. Going back to 1995, it has an average annual total return of 13.8%. Home Depot has an A/A2 rating by S&amp;P/Moody’s. Amazon and Walmart, two other top 10 tenants in Prologis’ portfolio, also have very high ratings.FedEx is a Memphis, Tennessee-based multinational company that provides logistic services such as deliveries, shipping, transportation, e-commerce and business solutions. It was founded in 1971 by Frederick W. Smith as an overnight courier service but has expanded its services greatly since then. It had its initial public offering (IPO) in December 1978. Deutsch bank recently maintained a Buy rating on FedEx shares and raised its price target from $240 to $282 per share.FedEx comprises 1.4% of the total square footage of Prologis’s leases.Walmart is a Bentonville, Arkansas-based American multinational retail corporation. Walmart operates a large chain of hypermarkets (combined department store and grocery supermarket), discount department stores and stand-alone grocery stores worldwide. It has over 10,500 stores and Sam’s Clubs across 24 different countries and employs 1.6 million people in the U.S.Walmart stores also offer several services, such as auto care centers, financial and photo services and pharmacies. Its Walmart Plus program provides users with discounts on streaming services, free shipping, free delivery, early access to online deals and product releases and savings on gasoline.Walmart was founded in 1962 by Sam and James Walton. Its IPO at $16.50 per share was in August 1972. Today, its annual revenue of $570 billion makes it the largest company by revenue in the world. Of Prologis’ total square footage, 0.6% is leased to Walmart.Recent newsOn April 18, Prologis announced its first-quarter operating results. Funds from operations of $1.22 were in line with analysts’ estimates, but revenue of $1.77 billion beat Wall Street’s view by $120 million and was 45.1% higher than revenue in the first quarter of 2022. Prologis also slightly raised its full-year 2023 guidance, from a range of $5.40-$5.50 to $5.42 to $5.50. The consensus is for $5.50.During the conference call, Prologis Co-Founder and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam said, “Demand remains healthy, despite some moderating in terms of decision-making. Given the macro environment, we continue to operate our business with a degree of caution.  We foresee any potential impact on demand as likely to overlap with a deceleration in new deliveries, sustaining momentum with favorable conditions for high occupancy and continued rent growth into 2024.”As for analysts, most of them tend to be bullish on Prologis. On April 19, UBS analyst Brent Dilts maintained a Buy position on Prologis and raised his price target to $144. On May 3, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll maintained an Outperform rating on Prologis and raised the price target from $144 to $148.Year to date, Prologis has had a total return of 10.2%, making it the second-best industrial REIT performer behind Plymouth Industrial REIT Inc. (NYSE: PLYM) and in the top 5% among all REITs.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

19,5c2ec7c9-56a3-469b-ba2a-4dbe4ad77b8d,WMT,2023-05-25,Walmart's Sam's Club has gone all in on AI. Will it help it get a leg up on Costco?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmarts-sams-club-has-gone-all-in-on-ai-will-it-help-it-get-a-leg-up-on-costco-122936329.html,1684931376,STORY,"['WMT', 'COST', 'BJ', 'XLP']","[It's all AI, all the time, for Sam's Club.Execs for the wholesale club unit of Walmart (WMT) told Yahoo Finance that it aims to build an extensive AI ecosystem to differentiate its store experience from its rivals.One goal: more accurate inventory data. Another goal: give more time to employees to actually help customers as they shop. That's all crucial as the company competes for value conscious consumers with other membership-based retailers like BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and Costco (COST).How? I recently had the chance, with Sam's Club executives, to get an inside look at how AI and technology is being used at a location in Secaucus, New Jersey. Here are some of the innovations:Sign up: To get a membership, shoppers start by using an iPad (AAPL) and scan a QR code to add their membership card to the app. That routine once took roughly 20 minutes; it's now down to single digits, said Todd Garner, Sam's VP of retail product management.Help! Displayed throughout the store, the QR Code, in the picture just below, allows customers to quickly ping an associate on an employee-facing app, called My Club, to come over and help. Garner said response time is ""getting pretty fast"" and customers can give immediate feedback on the exchange with the Sam's associate.Scan for help, now featured at Walmart's Sam's Club for customers to ask for associate help as oppose to searching around for help. (Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance).Ask Sam: If customers are curious where an item is, employees can ask an AI digital assistant, ""Ask Sam,"" on their iPhone or Google Android. It rolled out back in 2018 and now features new modifications like Spanish translations. Ashley Hughes, a market manager at Sam's Club in Secaucus told me: ""Ask Sam is pretty close to Siri and I think Siri pretty much knows how to do everything.""Robo-shop: Chipotle's ""Chippy"" has nothing on Sam's store robot. Sam's fans can expect to see a robot roaming around called Scrubbers. Each club has one, for now, and are nicknamed. ""Roberta"" works the floor at the Secaucus club.Story continuesThe robot was, in the past, just a robo-janitor. But now each has been retrofitted with an inventory intelligence tower. (""More bang for your buck,"" Garner added.)Roberta's work day: it runs once a day between 8-10 AM to clean the floors and tell associates if the aisles are dirty. If an item is out of stock, or getting close to being out of stock, it notifies the app tool MyClub/Own Your Inventory (OYI). In a typical day, Roberta and its robot peers take 22 million pictures and automates 35% of inventory management tasks.Known as Roberta at Sam's Club Secaucus, NJ location, scrubbers are now retrofitted with an AI-powered, intelligent towers (seen on left) to track inventory. (Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance)Fresh sales tool: Another machine learning part of the app creates data forecasts around fresh food production. Pete Rowe, Sam's Club VP of technology, said all the data from the Scrubbers, plus employee insight, is used to predict, and understand inventory levels—particularly food than can quickly spoil.The associate input is crucial, said Rowe. The machine does not know, at least not now anyway, that there's a local football tailgate that can up the demand for wings and beers. That said, forecasts for items like the ultra-popular rotisserie chicken can be updated hourly thanks to the new tech.Buy more: ""Scan &amp; Go,"" which has evolved to ""Scan &amp; Go Fuel"" and ""Scan &amp; Go Cafe,"" allows customers to pay for an entire order on the app, or schedule a mobile pickup at the cafe. The AI model also understands customer shopping preferences. That's why, before paying, you might get a ""Did You Forget?"" prompt to buy bacon along with the eggs you just picked up.So far, Scan &amp; Go seems like a hit for Sam's: its usage is up 230% since its inception in 2019.The bottom line: it's an new world at Sam's, and other retailers, and there's no turning back.Low-priced goods alone—and a lot of them— are no longer enough as Walmart CFO John David Rainey might tell you. ""It's not just around price."" he said on Yahoo Finance LIVE. ""It's also around convenience and that matters irrespective of what your income level is and so things like online pickup and delivery continue to grow in much faster rates than the rest of our business.""Which is crucial for a company the size of Sam's.This past quarter, for instance, Sam's produced sales of $20.5 billion, up 4.5%—along with a 6.3% increase in membership income. As of May 9, there are 600 Sam's Club locations in the U.S., per data platform ScrapeHero. That's compared to 589 Costco locations and 247 BJ's Wholesale Clubs.Meanwhile, year-to-date, shares of Sam's parent company, Walmart, which will host its annual meeting next week, are up 4.2%.

20,3a18dad5-a3ef-33cb-ba78-6e451567e7f5,WMT,2023-05-25,4 Blue-Chip Stocks From a Struggling Dow for a Stable Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-struggling-122400024.html,1684931040,STORY,"['CAT', 'COMP', 'MCD', 'PG', '^GSPC', 'WMT']","[U.S. stock markets have rallied year to date. after wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008 and terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Changes Course in 2023Several economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms.Consequently, the Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike in 2023. In his post-FOMC statement in May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank may keep interest rate unchanged at the current 5-5.25% range.A lower rate hike has enabled growth sector like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive this year. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 20% year to date. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index has also seen a decent rally of 8%. However, the Dow is down 0.3% so far this year.Our Top PicksDefying a struggling Dow, we have narrowed our search to four blue-Chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.The Construction Industries segment of CAT is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. Caterpillar’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help CAT deliver outsized returns.Zacks Rank #1 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.5% and 27.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.8% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. MCD continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #1 McDonald's has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 30 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services. WMT’s U.S. comp sales continued gaining from an increased market share in grocery in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4% for the current year and earnings growth rate of 10.5% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last seven days.The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG has benefitted from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG’s products play a key role in meeting the daily health, hygiene and cleaning needs of consumers around the world. PG has witnessed continued strong momentum as reflected by the underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided its organic sales growth.Procter &amp; Gamble remains focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. PG’s continued investment in the business alongside its efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscores its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.Zacks Rank #2 Procter &amp; Gamble has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for next fiscal year (June 2024).

21,306b4847-9d5e-37d8-82ea-578dbe7f4562,JWN,2023-05-25,Analysts Estimate Nordstrom (JWN) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-nordstrom-jwn-report-140008277.html,1684936808,STORY,['JWN'],"[Nordstrom (JWN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -100%.Revenues are expected to be $3.11 billion, down 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom?For Nordstrom, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -29.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nordstrom will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nordstrom would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +13.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nordstrom doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, Hibbett (HIBB) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.07 per share for the quarter ended April 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $468.6 million, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Hibbett has been revised 3.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.65%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hibbett will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $3.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Huntington shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Huntington is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Midwest industry that ranks in the Bottom 5% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 36 cents per share to 35 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Huntington right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

RRR will likely benefit from solid Las Vegas operations, strong visitation and development projects. This and the focus on repositioning of land portfolio bodes well. However, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates are a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Driving GrowthRed Rock Resorts’ Las Vegas operations have been a key growth driver in the past few quarters and the trend will likely continue in the upcoming quarters. During the first quarter of 2023, revenues from Las Vegas operations came in at $430 million, up 7.6% year over year. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA came in at $214.1 million compared with $198.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.The company is bullish about its long-term view, owing to favorable supply-demand dynamic, positive long-term trends in population growth and stable regulatory environment. Attributes such as best-in-class assets and locations, unparallel distribution and scale and a solid organic development pipeline are likely to add to the positives.Red Rock Resorts is witnessing favorable customer trends, following the reopening of most of its properties. During the first quarter of 2023, the company witnessed consistent visitation from its guests and strong spend per visit across its portfolio. Attributes such as consistent visitation from guests, increased spending per visit, more time spent on gaming devices and a return of core customers have added to the positives. The company reported growth in food and beverage and hotel segments fueled by the strength in catering business. RRR intends to focus on business optimization and cost-reduction measures to drive growth.Red Rock Resorts continues to focus on development projects to drive growth. During the first quarter, the company stated progress with respect to the Durango development project. During the quarter, the company emphasized on expanding its casino area with additional gaming positions. It is of the opinion that a larger casino footprint will better align the product offering given the backdrop of favorable demographics surrounding the Durango region. With solid progress reported (as of March 2023), the company anticipates opening the project by fourth-quarter 2023. It expects to spend approximately $780 million on the project, thereby covering costs related to design, construction, preopening expenses and financing expenses.The company emphasizes on divestitures to drive growth. On April 20, the Oakland A's entered into a purchase and sale agreement to buy 48.6 acres of land on Viva site. It was provided an option of acquiring additional eight acres of land on the site. Red Rock Resorts stated that upon closing of the transaction (along with the eight-acre option), it will retain 39.3 acres (of Viva site) for future monetization. The company is bullish on the repositioning strategy of land portfolio. It anticipates closing the deal in the fourth quarter of 2023.Story continuesConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, shares of Red Rock Resorts have gained 4.6% compared with the industry’s 16.6% growth. The downside was mainly due to inflationary pressures, increased energy costs and rising interest rates. During the first quarter of 2023, the company witnessed price inflation in ordinary goods and services such as food costs, supplies, energy costs and construction costs. During the quarter, food and beverage expenses increased 12.9% year over year to $60.1 million. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment. For 2023, our model predicts casino expenses and Food and beverage expenses to rise 4.5% and 5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Red Rock Resorts’ carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Also, regular maintenance and repair demand bodes well for the company.However, this wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related products is facing headwinds in the form of high costs and macroeconomic risks.Let us delve deeper into the factorsWhat is Favoring POOL?Pool is focused on expansion to drive revenues. It is foraying into newer geographic locations, expanding in existing markets and launching innovative product categories that will boost its market share. During first-quarter 2022, the company boosted its presence in the DIY segment of the market with the acquisition of Pinch A Penny. Given the synergies coupled with its robust development pipeline, the company expects the initiative to drive growth going ahead. During the first quarter of 2023, Pinch A Penny retail sales increased 10% year over year. During the quarter, POOL opened five new franchise locations.POOL benefits from its market-leading position that offers cost advantage and allows it to generate a higher return on investment than smaller companies. Further, the housing market continues to boost demand for Pool’s products despite numerous competitors and low barriers to entry. The company generates a large portion of its earnings from existing pools.More than half of its gross profits are generated from products related to the maintenance and repair of pools, while the remainder is derived from the construction and installation of pools and landscaping.HeadwindsPOOL has been witnessing increased expenses lately. Notably, inflationary cost increases in areas of facilities, freight, insurance, IT, advertising and marketing are leading to higher expenses. During the first quarter, selling and administrative expenses increased 5.9% year over year to $224 million. For 2023, the company anticipates inflationary pressure in the range of 4-5%.POOL’s business is susceptible to weather changes. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s operations were affected by unfavorable weather conditions in California, Arizona and Canada, which have about 50% of the company’s branches and sales operations, including Texas. So far this year, the company reported the impact of weather challenges on revenues (in the Western U.S.) of $60-$70 million.The company conducts business internationally, which increases its dependence on other economies. Thus, unfavorable political and regulatory conditions in the market where it functions, as well as negative currency translation, might dent the company’s international sales. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s European operations were negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures, spiraling energy costs and the war in Ukraine. During the quarter, net sales from European markets were down 25% year over year. Given the headwinds, the company expects European operations to be under pressure for some time.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of POOL have declined 14% in the past year against the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Products industry’s growth of 1.2%.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPOOL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The best shale sites have been drilled and executives and analysts worry there is not enough high-quality inventory to last another decade.Oil service firms, also paying down debt and shareholders, are shifting investments to less-polluting electric drilling rigs and fracking equipment, and technology like carbon-sequestration. That leaves less money for developing the tricks that could turn secondary properties into big producers.""The technology interests are in new frontiers of geothermal and hydrogen, and biofuels,"" said Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairperson of S&amp;P Global. ""I don’t see any other transformative technology at this time that is really going to change the global market.""Producers are turning to acquisitions to expand future production. On Monday, Chevron Corp agreed to pay $7.6 billion in stock and acquired debt for smaller rival PDC Energy Inc, a move that will add 10% to its oil and gas reserves. Chevron slashed its R&amp;D to $268 million last year from $435 million in 2020.WITHER R&amp;D SPENDING?SLB , the world's largest oilfield services firm and historically a major innovator, spent an average of 3% of revenues on research and engineering in the 10 years to 2017, according to a Reuters analysis of its financial filings. That spending topped out at 3.6% of revenue in 2016.Story continuesSince then, SLB's R&amp;D spending dropped to an average of 2.3% of revenues with some of that funneled into a New Energies group that focuses on developing lower-carbon forms of energy for its oil clients.""Who spends on the effort to make a tier 2 oil property into a tier 1?"" asks Arjun Murti, a partner at energy consultancy Veriten and a former Goldman Sachs analyst. His answer: ""No one.""SLB did not provide a comment on its research and development spending.Richard Spears, who sits on the boards of several oilfield services firms, said most are allocating their limited cash to make their tools more rugged, funding international growth, or paying down debt.""This is not technology development,"" he said. ""Buyers are valuing tomorrow's technology at zero or even at a negative because full commercial development takes capital … and the return of that capital is in doubt,"" Spears added.The lack of new technology is apparent in production forecasts. The Permian - the largest U.S. shale basin and oilfield - will expand output by 400,000 bpd this year, as new-well productivity ebbs, estimates energy technology firm Enervus. That compares to an increase of about 1.1 million bpd in 2018.""That combination of horizontal drilling plus fracking and completions that took shale to global prominence was unique. Outside of digital tools, there may never be another industry advancement like that in our lifetime,"" said David Forsberg, founder of energy venture fund Ascent Energy Ventures.The absence of new breakthroughs has companies looking to old tricks to squeeze more oil out of their properties.Pioneer Natural Resources Co , once the fastest growing shale oil producer, is testing out enhanced oil recovery - a technique that has been around for decades - that pumps water or gas into a well to push out more oil.Scott Sheffield, Pioneer Natural's CEO, views it as a way of addressing the oil that is often left behind. With companies getting only about 6% of oil out of the ground in the Permian, squeezing out more will prolong the shale field.""There are always little things, whether it is re-fracs or enhanced oil recovery on shale wells,"" said Dane Gregoris, managing director for Enverus. ""But that is not going to give you growth. It's not scalable enough to reverse the growth declines that the U.S. will begin to experience.""(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Denver; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

Gasoline inventories also dropped by 2.1 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 600,000 barrels.Story continuesThe market had also been helped by comments from Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman that short sellers should ""watch out"" ahead of next month’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.This raised expectations that Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the OPEC+ cartel, would seek another production cut in order to boost crude prices.However, this view took a hit Thursday after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said he expected OPEC+ to stand pat at its meeting in Vienna on June 4, a month after the cartel announced a surprise production cut.“I don't think that there will be any new steps, because just a month ago certain decisions were made regarding the voluntary reduction of oil production by some countries due to the fact that we saw the slow pace of global economic recovery,"" Novak said, according to the state-owned news agency RIA.Related ArticlesCrude oil lower; stronger dollar and debt ceiling uncertainty weighRussia's Novak does not expect new steps from OPEC+ meetingFactbox-Russian gold shipments to the UAE, China and Turkey]"

The rally was largely driven by expectations of tighter U.S. supplies as the travel-heavy summer season approaches.A warning from the Saudi Arabian energy minister against shorting oil also boosted prices.But this was countered by growing fears of a U.S. debt default, as lawmakers marked little progress towards reaching a deal to raise the debt ceiling. A U.S. default is expected to push the country into recession and have far-reaching consequences for the global economy, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen positing a June 1 deadline for a default.Brent oil futures fell 0.2% to $78.16 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.4% to $74.06 a barrel by 21:30 ET (01:30 GMT). Both contracts rallied nearly 2% on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude inventories sank by a substantially bigger-than-expected margin in the past week.Strength in the dollar weighed on oil markets, as expectations that U.S. rates will remain higher for longer pushed the greenback to a two-month high against a basket of currencies.The minutes of the Fed’s May meeting, released on Wednesday, showed that while policymakers were somewhat mixed over raising rates further in June, they also gave no indication to cut interest rates this year, presenting a hawkish outlook for the dollar.A stronger dollar makes crude more expensive for international buyers, stifling demand.Other factors also saw markets fear slowing demand this year. Major importer China is facing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, which the government expects to peak by late-June. While the variant of the virus affecting China appears to be mild, markets feared any more disruptions to economic activity.Story continuesThe outbreak comes as a string of indicators for April showed that a Chinese economic recovery was running out of steam, casting doubts over forecasts that China will drive oil demand to record highs this year.Weak economic indicators from the U.S., Euro Zone and the UK, which pointed to a sustained slowdown in manufacturing activity, positing a dim outlook for economic growth this year.Oil prices are still trading negative so far this year, and are set to end lower for the fifth consecutive month on concerns that slowing economic growth will erode demand.Related ArticlesOil rally cools as strong dollar, debt ceiling risks weighExclusive-From Russia with gold: UAE cashes in as sanctions biteOil stable as investors weigh US debt uncertainty, potential OPEC+ cuts]"

""T-bills were way ahead on this call, and they are not yet signalling an all-clear.""Yields on one-month bills, which are being shunned on concerns about payments coming due when the Treasury is most at risk of running out of money, hovered near a record high of 5.8005%.Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, meanwhile, edged down to 3.7361%.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, rose 0.33% to 103.89, nudging further above a two-month high of 103.63 reached last week.Story continuesThe New Zealand dollar dropped 2.3% after the Reserve Bank wrong-footed markets by keeping its forecast for the terminal rate at 5.5%, having hiked by a quarter point to that level.Europe's benchmark STOXX index fell 1.8% to a 1-1/2-month low, as a jump in UK core inflation and more losses in market-heavy luxury names hurt risk sentiment.British homebuilders led declines on the FTSE 100 after data showed a closely watched core measure of UK price growth surged to a 31-year high in April, cementing bets of more interest rate hikes from the Bank of England.Europe's luxury stocks fell 1.7% to a seven-week low as a sell-off in the sector continued.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares fell 1.1%.DEBT CEILING DOLDRUMSTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that Biden had offered changes that would result in a $1 trillion reduction in the U.S. deficit, and that there would be some obligations that the U.S. government would be unable to pay if the debt ceiling was not raised.While the risk of a default that could precipitate a recession is bad for the United States, investors worried about the repercussions for the global economy have turned away from riskier assets.Reports that Treasury has asked federal agencies whether they can delay upcoming payments added to the sense of crisis.""Payment prioritisation is now real,"" Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a client note.""And while it seems highly prudent to have this conversation, the market's anxiety levels have heated up consequently,"" he said. ""The market is starting to de-risk.""BRITAIN: INFLATION NATIONEuro zone bond yields rose after British inflation data came in stronger than expected, a reminder to investors that the global fight against price rises is far from over.Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, retreated from a one-month high of 2.501% struck earlier in the day.In commodities, gold fell 0.8% to $1,958.8, dragged in part by a firmer dollar.Interest rate hikes raise the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold.Crude oil price extended gains from Tuesday, when Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned speculators to ""watch out"", saying ""they will be ouching"".Brent crude futures rose more than a dollar to $78.36 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) likewise closed up $1.43 at $74.34 a barrel.(Reporting by Lawrence White and Kevin Buckland; Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook and Harry Robertson; Editing by Alex Richardson, William Maclean and Lisa Shumaker)]"

Ines Ferre is here with the details. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hey, Seana, that's right. A big drawdown when it came to inventories last week, and that's part of the reason why we saw oil spike today. You saw crude inventories that came down by more than 12 million barrels. That was a big surprise, because analysts had been expecting it to go up by about 800,000 barrels.Also, gasoline was down by 2.1 million barrels. Now, the Memorial Day is really the kickoff. The Memorial Day next week is really the kickoff for the driving season for the summertime. So the thought being, perhaps, that retailers were stocking up on gasoline ahead of the Memorial Day weekend.Also, some commentary from Saudi Arabia's energy minister basically warning short sellers watch out, saying, watch out, there could be pain ahead. Now, he said commentary before like this similar to this in the past. But the speculation is could there be further output cuts in the future when it comes to OPEC+? Oil today reaching a three-week high before coming down just a little bit but nevertheless settling up about 1% below $74 per barrel for WTI.Brent Crude up more than 1% when it comes to the price of Brent. I just want to point out a year to date chart just briefly. Remember that output cut that we saw in April, at the beginning of April? That's when you saw oil spike there. It has since come down here.So it's basically at the levels before that output cut was announced back by OPEC+. Same situation when it comes to WTI. But nonetheless, the impasse in Washington when it comes to the debt ceiling, that has also been putting a lid on oil prices recently, guys.SEANA SMITH: Yes, certainly. The conversation has changed, because once we did get that oil cut, there was lots of talk about it heading $90, maybe even $100, a barrel. Here we are today $73 a barrel. Ines, great stuff. Thanks.]"

Every year more than a billion reach the end of the road. Until recently, most were thrown into landfills or piled up in storage yards, which occasionally caught fire. Tougher environmental laws mean many countries now insist tyres are recycled. And they are, sort of. Some of the methods might be better than dumping them, but they are not especially green.Energy recovery is one common method. This involves burning tyres in an incinerator to generate electricity, or as a supplementary fuel to provide heat for cement kilns and other industrial processes. But that produces planet-warming pollution. Tyres can be used whole or shredded in construction projects, such as building embankments or repairing roads. There are, however, concerns about chemicals from the tyres leaching out and contaminating the ground.Some firms, therefore, have begun exploring an alternative, pleasingly symmetrical idea. Since tyres are mostly made from hydrocarbons, it should be possible in principle to turn old tyres into low-carbon fuel which can be used to run the vehicles they came from.One of the most ambitious firms pursuing the idea is Wastefront, which is based in Oslo, in Norway. Later this year the company will start building a giant tyre-recycling plant in Sunderland in north-east England. In a couple of years, when the plant is fully operational, it will be able to turn 8m old tyres into new products, including some 25,000 tonnes of a gooey black liquid called tyre derived oil (TDO).The process works by deconstructing a tyre into its three main components. One is steel, which is used to brace the structure of a tyre and which can be readily recycled. The second is carbon black, a powdery, soot-like form of carbon used to improve the durability of the tyre. The third is rubber. Some of that will be natural rubber obtained from the sap of rubber trees. Some will be the synthetic sort, which is made in factories from crude oil.Story continuesIn order to do the deconstructing, the tyres are first shredded and the steel bracing removed. The remaining material then goes through a process called pyrolysis. This involves exposing a material to high temperatures in the absence of air. That causes the rubber to decompose into a mix of hydrocarbon gases, which are drawn off. What is left behind is pure carbon black.Once the drawn-off gas has cooled down, a proportion of it liquefies into TDO. The remaining gases, which include methane, are funnelled back around to be burned, fuelling the reactor. This, says Vianney Valès, Wastefront’s boss, creates a closed-loop system that prevents emissions. The overall output of the process by weight is 40% TDO, 30% carbon black, 20% steel and 10% gas.The carbon black can be re-used to make new tyres. That is of interest to tyre-makers because it helps efforts to become carbon neutral. Producing new carbon black requires the partial burning of heavy oil residues or coal, which produces plenty of greenhouse-gas emissions.The recovered TDO is similar to crude oil fresh from the ground, and is well-suited for making diesel. To do that, Wastefront is working with Vitol, a Swiss company that is the world’s largest independent oil trader, and which operates a number of refineries around the world.While not completely carbon-neutral, diesel made from TDO does produce an 80-90% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, compared with the conventional fuel. The future market for cleaner fuels is likely to remain substantial, even though electric vehicles are steadily replacing those with combustion engines. Fossil-fuelled vehicles will remain on the road for decades to come, particularly large commercial vehicles like lorries, which are harder to electrify and which are big burners of diesel. The fuel will also be needed by trains and ships. So, anything that helps to clean up overall emissions during what will be a long transition to the electrification of transport is useful—especially if it also shrinks a mountainous waste problem.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Morgan Stanley (MS).Morgan Stanley currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.88, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.88 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 56.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MSBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MSCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Morgan Stanley here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Morgan Stanley, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MS Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Morgan Stanley, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 1.2% over the past month to $6.53.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Morgan Stanley. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Morgan Stanley with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 3.1%. View our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Omnicom Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, Omnicom Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 24.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 35% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendOmnicom Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.8% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.We Could See Omnicom Group's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Omnicom Group has impressed us by growing EPS at 7.4% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.We Really Like Omnicom Group's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Omnicom Group might even raise payments in the future. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

The embedded nature of the solution ensures the completion of the checkout process with only the help of a few buttons and minor disruptions.Built with the power of tokenization, Click to Pay infuses security within online transactions, thereby minimizing the chances of fraud and boosting conversion rates. This, in turn, is likely to boost the revenue base of merchants.Additionally, the credibility of the solution makes merchants confident enough to include secure payment links while sending invoices to customers via digital methods comprising SMS, email or WhatsApp. Subsequently, customers can utilize the links to make hassle-free payments.Apart from being of great use to merchants, the Click to Pay solution relieves consumers from the tardiness associated with inputting one’s card credentials or disclosing confidential data with every single merchant they opt to transact with.The recent move reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to solidify its footprint as a leading technology provider of innovative and secure payment solutions across the UAE. Such partnerships signal Mastercard’s endeavor to work closely with PSPs, merchants, acquirers and issuers in order to expand the reach of its innovative payment solutions across its markets. The booming digital economy of the UAE might have prompted Mastercard to resort to the latest collaboration with one of the country’s leading technology providers. The growing digitization across every sphere of life has led to consumers preferring online shopping within the comfort of their homes, thereby substantiating the timeliness of advanced payment solutions.Story continuesA solid digital arm built on partnerships and investments is expected to extend a helping hand to Mastercard in capturing a significant share of the digital payments market of the UAE.Shares of Mastercard have gained 8.4% in a year, compared with the industry’s 3.8% growth.

(NYSE:CRM) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Salesforce Salesforce Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$53m worth of shares at a price of US$182 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$209). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 1.1% of Marc Benioff's holding.In the last year Salesforce insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Salesforce better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Salesforce Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Salesforce shares. In total, Independent Director Neelie Kroes sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Salesforce insiders own 3.2% of the company, worth about US$6.5b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Salesforce Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Salesforce you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The increase was primarily due to more normalized levels of investment following the pandemic, following unusually low capital expenditures in the prior year period.Full Year Fiscal 2024 and First Quarter OutlookThe Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and other consumer spending-related headwinds, foreign currency volatility, the war in Ukraine and COVID-19-related impacts, among others. The full year Fiscal 2024 and first quarter guidance excludes any potential restructuring-related and other net charges that may be incurred in future periods, as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.For Fiscal 2024, the Company expects revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to benefit revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points in Fiscal 2024.The Company expects operating margin for Fiscal 2024 to expand approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. Foreign currency is expected to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024. Gross margin expansion is expected to increase about 50 to 100 basis points in constant currency, with stronger AUR and reduced freight costs more than offsetting continued product cost inflation through the majority of the fiscal year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in Fiscal 2024.For the first quarter, the Company expects revenues to be flat to up slightly to last year on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, including approximately 150 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, revenues are expected to be down slightly to prior year. This outlook includes approximately 220 basis points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring North America wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruptions, which benefited our fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023.Operating margin for the first quarter is expected to expand approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency, driven by stronger gross margins. Gross margin expansion is expected to be driven by lower freight costs and continued AUR growth partially offset by increased product costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating and gross margins by approximately 50 basis points in the first quarter.The full year Fiscal 2024 tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. First quarter of Fiscal 2024 tax rate is expected to be about 23% to 24%.The Company is planning capital expenditures for Fiscal 2024 of approximately $275 million to $300 million.Conference CallAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call and live online webcast today, Thursday, May 25, 2023, at 9:00 A.M.

The income tax provision reflects enactment-related charges of $27.6 million recorded in connection with U.S. tax reform.NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESBecause Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global company, the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on the Company's reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), the Company's discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. The Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to its reported operating results. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in the Company's businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company's operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.This earnings release also includes certain other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures relating to the impact of charges and other items as described herein. The Company uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and to better represent the manner in which it conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods. While the Company considers non-U.S. GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures reported by other companies.Adjustments made during the fiscal periods presented include charges recorded in connection with the Company's restructuring activities, as well as certain other charges (benefits) associated with other non-recurring events, as described in the footnotes to the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above. Fiscal 2022 was also adjusted for the fiscal year's incremental week that occurred during the fourth quarter. The income tax benefit (provision) has been adjusted for the tax-related effects of these charges, which were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for each applicable jurisdiction. The income tax benefit (provision) has also been adjusted for certain other one-time income tax events and other adjustments, as described in the footnotes to the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above. Included in this earnings release are reconciliations between the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures before and after these adjustments.Additionally, the Company's full year Fiscal 2024 and first quarter guidance excludes any potential restructuring-related and other charges that may be incurred in future periods. The Company is not able to provide a full reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP as it is not known at this time if and when any such charges may be incurred in the future. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company's non-U.S. GAAP based financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures cannot be provided at this time given the uncertain nature of any such potential charges that may be incurred in future periods.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230524005696/en/ContactsInvestor Relations:Corinna Van der Ghinstir@ralphlauren.com OrCorporate Communicationsrl-press@ralphlauren.com]"
52,9d7245bc-1a4c-3a26-b384-8b8249d374ab,PCG,2023-05-25,Is Now The Time To Look At Buying PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-pg-134130212.html,1684935690,STORY,['PCG'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$17.45 and falling to the lows of US$15.28. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether PG&amp;E's current trading price of US$16.41 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at PG&amp;E’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for PG&amp;E What Is PG&amp;E Worth?Good news, investors! PG&amp;E is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $21.06, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because PG&amp;E’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from PG&amp;E?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. PG&amp;E's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 61%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since PCG is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PCG for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy PCG. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

70,8dfc1e12-d6a1-3df8-bde6-653128a631d5,ADM,2023-05-25,Investors in Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) have seen strong returns of 100% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-archer-daniels-midland-nyse-110037466.html,1685012437,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last quarter. But over three years, the returns would have left most investors smiling In the last three years the share price is up, 87%: better than the market.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Archer-Daniels-Midland achieved compound earnings per share growth of 44% per year. The average annual share price increase of 23% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 8.90 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Archer-Daniels-Midland has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Archer-Daniels-Midland's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Archer-Daniels-Midland's TSR for the last 3 years was 100%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Archer-Daniels-Midland had a tough year, with a total loss of 16% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 1.7%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli. During his appearance on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' on May 5, Mario Gabelli, the billionaire CEO of GAMCO Investors, acknowledged that he identifies himself as a long-term value investor. Rather than solely considering company fundamentals, he emphasizes a broader perspective. Gabelli praised Warren Buffett's strategy in the financial sector, noting that Buffett tends to prefer investing in insurance companies over banks due to the volatility and risk associated with bank failures and subsequent financial losses. He also strongly criticized the mishandling that resulted in the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. On the other hand, Mario Gabelli noted that the long-term health of businesses seems healthy based on cash flow, reduced double ordering, and inventories coming down. However, in the short-term, these companies are facing staggering interest rates on borrowing.  Mario Gabelli, in an interview with Markets Insider on April 4, warned that American investors could potentially encounter a recession in the near future. He also expressed concerns about potential stock market declines, a decrease in house prices, and the lingering effects of the banking crisis. The billionaire told Markets Insider: ""I see an economic slowdown in the second half of 2023, probably a recession.""Nonetheless, Gabelli forecasted that the downturn wouldn't be overly severe due to anticipated federal infrastructure initiatives and increased government spending in preparation for the upcoming presidential election. These measures are expected to boost demand. Additionally, Gabelli pointed out that companies relocating their operations back to the country and the recovery of countries like China could help mitigate the effects of the economic slowdown. He further said: Story continues""The Fed is unlikely to bend at the moment. They'll stay the course and raise rates.""As per Markets Insider, Gabelli emphasized the potential danger of a credit crunch that could arise if customers continue to transfer their deposits from smaller banks to larger ones or money-market funds. He also highlighted the possibility of lenders becoming more cautious and scaling back their lending activities due to concerns about potential bank runs. Gabelli noted that tighter financing conditions could have a significant impact on the housing and commercial real estate sectors, as both heavily rely on loans for their operations.In this article, we discuss the 10 newest value stocks that billionaire Mario Gabelli added to his Q1 2023 portfolio. Among these additions are Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR), and Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX).

However, they trimmed the estimates for fiscal year 2024 by approximately 2%-3%.

Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”9. Titan International, Inc. (NYSE:TWI)Stake Value of GAMCO Investors: $524,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Titan International, Inc. (NYSE:TWI) engages in the production and distribution of wheels, tires, undercarriage systems, and related components for off-highway vehicles.

Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates held the largest position in the company, comprising 5.3 million shares worth $321 million. Baron Funds made the following comment about Toll Brothers, Inc.

(NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share. Historically, Toll Brothers’ shares have been valued, on average, at 1.4 times book value and a peak multiple of approximately 2.0 times tangible book value.

The billionaire acquired a position worth $660,424 in the company during the first quarter of 2023. On May 15, Oppenheimer analyst Suraj Kalia initiated coverage of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) as a global leader in healthcare diagnostics, imaging, and intervention, emphasizing its extensive range of products in areas such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasound, services, and digital solutions. The analyst believes that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC)’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 22 times is lower than the average applied to large-cap medical technology companies, but considers this valuation appropriate given the current stage of GE Healthcare's development as an independent entity.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 37 hedge funds were bullish on GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), up from 8 funds in the prior quarter. Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM), Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE: UNVR), and Garrett Motion Inc.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) is one of the top value stocks in Mario Gabelli’s Q1 portfolio.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We sold GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) during the quarter. GE HealthCare is a recent spin-off from General Electric Company and provides imaging, ultrasound, patient care solutions and pharmaceutical diagnostics to customers around the world. The company is a leader in a global oligopoly and has a massive installed base. Half of the company’s revenue is recurring, margins are stable to rising, and it generates significant free cash flow. As a recent operating unit inside of GE, we believe the market has been undervaluing this asset. Although the spin price reflected this under-valuation, after the spin-off, its stock price rose to meet our estimate of its intrinsic value, and we sold the position. GE HealthCare remains on our MVP list.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli.  Suggested articles:11 Stocks with Heavy Insider Buying20 Poorest Countries in Asia10 Best Small Cap Bank Stocks With Dividends Disclosure: None. 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So while Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Philip Morris International, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 30%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Tobacco industry average of 17%. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceIn the above chart we have measured Philip Morris International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Philip Morris International.What Does the ROCE Trend For Philip Morris International Tell Us?In terms of Philip Morris International's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 45%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Philip Morris International is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 55% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Philip Morris International does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant...If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

77,35b59496-cf08-3556-9b18-0a751ac8b74f,HCA,2023-05-25,US Debt-Ceiling Crisis Looms: How Will It Impact Medical Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-debt-ceiling-crisis-looms-135600773.html,1684936560,STORY,"['UNH', 'PFE', 'HCA']","[The United States is facing a looming debt-ceiling crisis that could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is the total amount the U.S. government is allowed to borrow to finance its expenditure, such as paying salaries and welfare allowances. On Jan 19, the United States hit its debt ceiling limit of $31.4 trillion, leading to a standoff between the White House and Congress over how to raise or suspend the limit, per a Reuters article. A continued impasse related to the debt-ceiling crisis will impact all sectors. The medical companies may face challenges as government healthcare spending may get reduced or halted without a resolution.Probable Impact of the CrisisU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the country could default on its debt as early as Jun 1, 2023 if the impasse is not resolved. A default would mean that the United States would fail to pay its creditors, such as foreign governments and investors, who hold U.S. Treasury bonds. This could trigger a financial crisis that would have a ripple effect across the world, impacting markets, trade and currencies. A potential default will also have significant implication for the healthcare industry, with the government focusing more on repaying its debt than healthcare-related spending. The default may also impact Social Security and unemployment insurance benefits, leading to lower or delayed medical expenses by patients.Factors Causing High DebtThe debt-ceiling crisis is part of an ongoing political debate within Congress about federal government spending and the national debt that the U.S. government accrues. The United States has had large budget deficits for years, meaning that it spends more than it collects in taxes. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government brought in $4.90 trillion but spent $6.27 trillion, with a net budget deficit of $1.38 trillion (the fourth highest of the 21st century).Story continuesThe main drivers of federal spending are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Other expenses of the government comprise discretionary spending, which also includes defense. A portion of the budget is also spent on paying interest on the debt, which is expected to rise further as debt grows.Here we discuss three medical stocks that may be potentially impacted by the crisis going forward:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth Group UNH is the largest health insurer in the United States, serving more than 150 million customers through its various plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. A default may result in a potential disruption in UNH’s revenue stream and cash flow. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have declined 9.6% so far this year.HCA Healthcare HCA, the largest for-profit hospital operator in the United States, owns and operates 186 hospitals and 121 freestanding surgery centers across 20 states and the United Kingdom. HCA could get delayed payments from Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 40% of its net revenues in case of a default. Shares of HCA Healthcare have gained 11.6% so far this year.Pfizer PFE, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, produces and sells a wide range of drugs and vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. A default may affect PFE’s ability to collect payments from government agencies and programs, such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration. Shares of Pfizer have lost 22.6% so far this year.UnitedHealth Group, HCA Healthcare and Pfizer all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Debt Ceiling HistoryPer a Reuters article, the United States has raised its debt ceiling 78 times since 1960, usually without much controversy. However, in recent years, some lawmakers have used the debt ceiling as a leverage point to demand spending cuts or policy changes from the opposing party. This resulted in several near-default situations and government shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2019.Current ScenarioIn the current impasse, Republicans have proposed cutting spending back to 2022 levels as a precondition to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats have insisted on a ""clean bill"" without preconditions, as had been the case in raising the ceiling three times during the Trump administration.President Joe Biden has urged Congress to act swiftly and responsibly to avoid a default that would harm millions of Americans and damage the country's reputation and creditworthiness. He has also ruled out invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which some legal scholars argue gives him the authority to bypass Congress and raise the debt limit unilaterally. Biden has said he does not want to create a constitutional crisis over a fiscal one.As the deadline approaches, both sides are under pressure to reach a compromise or face the consequences of a historic default that could plunge the world into a new recession.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PPG is gaining from cost savings from restructuring actions, synergies of acquisitions and pricing initiatives to counter cost inflation amid headwinds from softer demand, which is hurting its volumes.The company’s shares have gained around 10.9% over the past year, compared with its industry’s rise of 0.6% over the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG Industries, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, as well as optimizing its working capital requirements. The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end markets with weak business conditions.PPG Industries is also raising selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of cost inflation in raw materials, energy and logistics. The company witnessed a significant increase in its profits in the first quarter driven by pricing growth across segments, improved manufacturing efficiencies and overall cost discipline. Pricing measures are likely to continue to support its margins in the remainder of 2023.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance in 2023. Acquisitions, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line this year.PPG Industries also remains committed to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It has raised the annual dividend payout for 51 consecutive years. In 2022, the company returned around $570 million to shareholders through dividends and about $190 million through share repurchases. It also paid dividends worth around $145 million in the first quarter.However, weaker demand in Europe and China is hurting the company’s volumes. The continued geopolitical issues in Europe, partly stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is hurting demand in the region. The slower manufacturing recovery in China following the lifting of the pandemic-related restrictions is also affecting demand in that country. Economic slowdown in Europe and continued disruptions from geopolitical factors might adversely impact results in the second quarter. Factoring in current global economic activities, geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries, PPG expects sales volumes in the second quarter to be flat with the potential for slight improvement or decrease of a low single-digit percentage year over year. Softer industrial demand is likely to hurt volumes.PPG Industries also faces headwinds from unfavorable currency translation, which is affecting its overall sales as witnessed in the first quarter. Unfavorable currency swings stemming from a strong appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus many foreign currencies including the euro, impacted sales by around 2% in the first quarter. Unfavorable currency translation affected sales by around $110 million in the quarter. Currency headwinds are likely to continue to impact sales in the second quarter.Story continues PPG Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus PPG Industries, Inc.

The FTC is also looking into whether company coordination affected sales more broadly outside of just the formula supply program, this all according to the Wall Street Journal. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the details, and I remember those empty shelves, Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, that's actually what spurred, probably, this look from the FTC, looking at whether or not those bids actually give the companies a market domination position. So when they do go out to bid with the states every three to four years, they stay out of each other's territories of who actually wins that bid. And that's what the FTC is looking into.Now, we've reached out to the three dominant players in this, and that's-- sorry-- Reckitt Benckiser, Abbott, and Nestlé. Perrigo, which is another dominant market player in the non-WIC category, or the non-women's, infant's, and children's category, which is what this is all about, does have the rights to produce Nestlé's brand, but without the WIC market. So it's an interesting little shift that happened late last year, where they acquired those rights but are not part of this.We do know that Abbott has tried to push back on the inquiry from the FTC, asking specifically to pare back the amount of information that's required. But the FTC has said that it is going to continue to ask for the same amount of information, looking as far back as 2016. And this is based off of a 2015 USDA report showing that there could have been some of these colluding practices. So that's really what the FTC is focused on.Of course, this is just starting. We've reached out to all these companies and none have returned requests for comment from Yahoo Finance just yet. And we do know that this is an ongoing issue for these companies.JULIE HYMAN: Right. And the FTC doesn't always confirm when these things are going on. So the Journal reporting this and and we'll see what ends up happening. It could take some time.]"

Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.Geographically, the United States grew 13% year over year operationally, inclusive of a 140 basis-point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable organic strength across each business unit. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 20% on an operational basis, with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth is driven by Boston Scientific’s diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.The company remains excited about the year ahead and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pacific grew 15% operationally, with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. During the first quarter, the company received health sciences authority approval for FARAPULSE in Singapore. In Japan, first-quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon. China also grew in double digits in the first quarter, ahead of the company’s expectations, with solid procedural demand as hospitals work through COVID delayed procedures.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteThe raised 2023 guidance seems bullish, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.Story continuesOn the flip side, continued foreign exchange headwinds largely offset Boston Scientific’s top-line performance. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s revenues reflected a $88 million headwind from foreign exchange with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. On an operational basis, the company’s revenues had a 290-basis point headwind from foreign exchange.Further, Boston Scientific witnessed significant cost pressure. There was an 8.9% rise in the cost of products sold. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.6%, while Research and development expenses rose 5.6%. Considering the industry-wide trend, Boston Scientific continues to expect 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds.Further, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

88,82679008-da7d-398a-8da9-838ec64279bf,HOLX,2023-05-25,Abbott (ABT) Unveils Late-Breaking Data on Leadless Pacemaker,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-abt-unveils-breaking-data-160700336.html,1684944420,STORY,"['HOLX', 'ZBH', 'ABT']","[Abbott ABT announced a favorable outcome on its leadless pacemaker. The company unveiled late-breaking results from the AVEIR dual-chamber (DR) i2i Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study.The study demonstrated that AVEIR DR leadless pacemaker met its three prespecified primary endpoints for safety and performance. The data also noted that this device could provide new benefits for people with slower-than-normal heart rhythms.This favorable outcome has been sent to the FDA as part of Abbott's submission for approval of the AVEIR DR device.More on the NewsThe results were presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the Heart Rhythm Society's (HRS) 44th annual meeting from May 19-21, 2023. The study has also been published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Abbott noted that in the study, primary safety and efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the first 300 people enrolled across 55 centers in the United States, Canada and Europe.  Its three-month post-implant results showed that physicians demonstrated a 98.3% implant success rate. Further, the safety endpoint evaluating freedom from device or procedure complications was achieved. The company also noted that more than 97% of people had successful atrio-ventricular (AV) synchrony.Added to this, in each of the seven different postures and walking speeds, the average AV synchrony was more than 95%. This, according to Abbott, implies that the system will function appropriately during everyday life activities. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere's How AVEIR DR is BetterAccording to Abbott, unlike traditional pacemakers, leadless pacemakers are implanted directly into the heart through a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure. This eliminates the need for cardiac leads and a pulse generator under the skin.The company stated that many people require pacing and sensing in both the right atrium and the right ventricle. However, the currently available leadless pacing options are limited to single-chamber ventricular devices. This is because seamless, wireless synchronization of two leadless pacemakers has been a significant technological challenge.Story continuesFor the vast majority of people, a dual-chamber pacemaker like AVEIR DR will be of great benefit.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global arrhythmia monitoring devices market size is expected to reach $8.41 billion in 2025, with a CAGR of 6.8%. Continuous R&amp;D activities in the field of cardiac monitoring are driving the market.Latest DevelopmentAbbott’s last-reported first quarter of 2023 organic sales, excluding COVID testing, increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China, and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.Within Nutrition, sales increased more than 10%. In the United States, pediatric nutrition growth of more than 35% was driven by favorable year-over-year comparisons (lower sales in the first quarter of 2022 were due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products).Within Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid-to-high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. Despite dull sales in China, Core Lab Diagnostics sales showed year-over-year improvement, driven by strong performance in the United States and Europe.Within Medical Devices, sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the United States and double-digit growth internationally. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens growth internationally.Share Price PerformanceOver the past year, Abbott has been outperforming the industry it belongs to.

The company’s Price/Sales ratio of 0.8 compares favorably with the industry’s 3.9.Accuray is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and strategic partnerships are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding stiff competition and overdependence on technologies persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversSolid Product Portfolio: Accuray’s solid product portfolio raises investors’ optimism. On the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in November 2022, the company confirmed its launch of VitalHold, which resulted from its partnership with C-RAD, at the ASTRO show in San Antonio, TX.On the same call, Accuray confirmed that it had also demonstrated its newest innovation, ARTemis, the online adaptive capability in partnership with RaySearch, at the ASTRO show.Strategic Partnerships: Investors are optimistic about Accuray’s slew of partnerships over the past few months. On the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in April, Accuray’s management confirmed that the company’s partnership with GE Healthcare continues to advance on multiple commercial fronts.On the second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in February, the company confirmed that it had advanced key strategic partnerships, most recently with C-RAD, introducing the VitalHold breast package that will allow Accuray to offer the most comprehensive breast package in the market.Strong Q3 Results: Accuray’s robust third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded solid overall top-line and bottom-line performances in the quarter. Robust Product and Services revenues and geographical performances were also witnessed. Accuray also registered continued strong demand for its Clear RT and Synchrony on Radixact and the CyberKnife S7.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on Technologies: Achieving consumer and third-party payor acceptance of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms as preferred methods of tumor treatment is crucial to Accuray’s continued success. Physicians will not begin to use or increase the use of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data and other factors, that the two platforms are safe and effective alternatives to traditional treatment methods.Stiff Competition: The medical device industry and the non-invasive cancer treatment field, in particular, are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. To compete successfully, Accuray will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of its products and technologies over well-established alternative procedures, and other counterparts and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of the same.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

It's now evolved into a race for ad dollars amid a greater profitability push.Mark Boidman, partner and global head of media at Solomon Partners, told Yahoo Finance the shift from pure-play subscriber growth to cash generation via ads means the streaming wars are no longer about one platform versus the other. Rather, Boidman described it as ""a different type of battle"" — a battle against broadcast television and its multibillion dollar ad bucket.US TV ad spending hit $66.64 billion in 2022, an increase of more than $5 billion compared to the previous year, according to recent data from eMarketer.Although ad spending is expected to slow over the next five years, Boidman argued capturing ad money from that bucket is ""where you're going to see all of these companies create value for shareholders.""Ultimately, Boidman predicted cable will be obsolete in the next 10 years, signaling traditional TV's demise as ""a massive opportunity for all of these streaming companies to go after not only those audiences, but those advertising dollars.""""That doesn't mean that you need to have the largest audience [but] the highest quality audience,"" he explained. ""Audiences who can afford a subscription, who can afford to shop in the store. ...That's attractive to brands.""Media giants are already beginning to flex their ability to attract ad buyers.At Netflix's (NFLX) virtual upfronts presentation earlier this month, the platform revealed its ad-based plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" has 5 million global monthly active users, or MAUs, a metric that Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman said ""actually matter[s] to advertisers."" The plan debuted in November.Disney (DIS), meanwhile, said it plans to optimize its pricing model in order to ""increase subscriber revenue for the premium ad-free tier and drive growth of subscribers who opt for the lower cost ad-supported option."" The company launched its $7.99 ad tier in December of last year.Story continuesThe streaming wars are evolving as competition escalates and legacy TV loses its luster. (Christina Reichl Photography via Getty Images)Additionally, Disney revealed it will be it will soon offer a one-app experience domestically that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination, as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+. ""Bundling is increasingly going to be a theme,"" Boidman said. ""Some of that is to unify the streaming experience, reduce churn and give consumers greater experience and engagement [but] that could also help on the advertising side as putting content under one app brings in more advertisers.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The extra member account must be activated in the same country where the owner created their account.Paid sharing model is an integral step to tackle widespread account sharing, which erodes the company’s ability to invest and improve content for its paying members.

With advertising taking center stage, could we see new growth strategies emerging? ""Yahoo Finance"" reporter Alexandra Canal is here with more. Allie, what are you seeing?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle. We are in a critical moment of the streaming wars. That's why you're seeing a lot of new revenue initiatives like ad-supported tiers, like Netflix's crackdown on password sharing, which just hit the US yesterday, along with a lot of restructuring efforts, as all of these companies really are racing towards profitability.So I wanted to figure out what is the next big growth engine in the streaming wars. Is it gaming? Is it repurposed theaters? What's ultimately going to win these battles? And through my conversation, it's clear that this war is evolving. It's different than what we've had in the past. I spoke with Mark Boidman. He's the global head of media at Salomon Partners. And he told me that right now, the streaming wars is not each service against each other, but these services collectively against traditional media. That old school media that we've been so used to.In his view, we will not have cable in the next 10 years. And that leaves a lot of those audiences, in addition to a lot of those ad dollars on the table. The Pay TV ad market, it's a $60 billion plus opportunity. So the big question is, what do these streaming giants can collect as much as they can from that $60 billion bucket? And that's really what's going to create the value for shareholders and increase that stock price.So we're seeing right now this big gap between the advertising tier for a lot of these streaming companies and the premium streaming tier. And that's because they want to drive those subscribers to ad-supported. The more subscribers they get there, the better the impressions will be. And that's obviously attracted to ad buyers. Another big theme to watch is bundling. That's all connected to this story. That's why we're seeing HBO combo with Discovery content.We have Disney Plus and Hulu being offered together as one service, Paramount and Showtime. That creates a better viewing experience for subscribers, but also a more attractive play for these advertising giants. So that's a big thing to watch now. Advertising really the next big growth opportunity here as all of these players are really fighting for survival and relevancy. And I do think it sets us up for more M&amp;A, media M&amp;A, in particular, coming in 2024.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So I'm going to have to go back and try and figure out all the best bundles so I can get the most bang for my buck.]"

ANF jumped more than 14% following the impressive first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.Despite significant inflation and global macroeconomic disruption, results have gained from the continued momentum in the Abercrombie brand and sequential improvement in the Hollister brand. The apparel retailer undertook efforts to improve its inventory across all labels, thereby attracting customers to shop for a diverse range of products like dresses and cargo.Also, strategic investments across stores, digital and technology via its Always Forward Plan bodes well. Consequently, management has raised its fiscal 2023 view.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureAbercrombie has reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share in the first quarter, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 2 cents. First-quarter earnings reflected a significant increase of 44.4% from the year-ago period’s 27 cents.Net sales of $836 million rose 3% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $812 million.

This can be attributed to 760 basis points from lower freight costs and 230 basis points from AUR growth, partly offset by 320 basis points from higher cotton and raw material costs, and 100 basis points from the adverse currency.Operating expenses, excluding other operating income, were up 3% year over year. Higher technology expenses and incentive-based compensation more than offset lower digital marketing and fulfillment expenses.As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 57.3% expanded 30 bps from 57% in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesThe adjusted operating income was $38.4 million against a loss of $6 million in the year-ago period.Other FinancialsAbercrombie ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $447 million, long-term net borrowings of $297.2 million, and stockholders’ equity of $702 million, excluding non-controlling interests.The company had a liquidity of $758 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter, which included cash and equivalents, and borrowing available under the ABL Facility.

It expects the Abercrombie brand to outperform Hollister. Region-wise, the United States is likely to outperform International. Also, fiscal 2023 includes a 53rd week, which is estimated to benefit sales by $45 million. Store expansion is also a growth driver.Abercrombie expects an operating margin of 5-6%, up from the earlier stated 4-5%.

The operating margin is envisioned to be 2-3% compared to breakeven in the prior-year quarter.

OLLI has exhibited a decent run on the bourse so far in the year. Shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company have rallied 31.5% so far in the year against the industry’s decline of 6.3%. The company’s business operating model of “buying cheap and selling cheap,” cost-containment efforts, focus on store productivity and the expansion of the customer loyalty program — Ollie's Army — reinforce its position in the industry.We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the current and next financial year has risen 0.4% and 1% to $2.57 and $2.90, respectively, over the past 60 days. Estimates suggest an increase of 58.6% and 12.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period.A Solid Business ModelOllie's Bargain’s focus on value-driven merchandise assortments positioned it well to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace and effectively meet consumer demand. Ollie's Army continued to be a major sales driver, with membership increasing continuously. In fiscal 2022, Ollie's Army rose 4.8%, ending the period with 13.2 million members. In fiscal 2022, more than 80% of sales were from Ollie’s Army members.The company’s results depend on the availability of the brand name and closeout merchandise at compelling prices. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented about 65%, and non-closeout goods and private-label products collectively accounted for roughly 35% of fiscal 2022 merchandise purchases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly, Ollie's Bargain remains committed to offering better deals, improving operating margins and increasing the store count. The company should benefit from a favorable closeout environment and trade-down activity.For fiscal 2023, management estimates net sales between $2.036 billion and $2.058 billion, up from the $1.827 billion reported in fiscal 2022. It expects comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2% against the 3% decline witnessed last fiscal.Story continuesEnhancing ReachAs far as the company’s store growth strategy is concerned, management aims for a store count of at least 1,050 in the long run. Ollie's Bargain increased its store base at a CAGR of 11.5% from 303 stores in fiscal 2018 to 468 stores in fiscal 2022.We note that the company opened 46 and 40 stores in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Biotechnology is one of the hottest sectors these days. A handful of industries, such as space exploration, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, are making rapid leaps forward. For biotechnology, the greatest stimulus has been the coronavirus pandemic as the industry was solely responsible for bailing humanity out of the devastating crisis.Simply put, biotechnology is the use of biological raw materials to make vaccines and other products with them. This is in sharp contrast to traditional pharmaceutical applications that use plants and other raw materials to make medicines. Through biotechnology, firms such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) were able to develop the revolutionary messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines that were able to effectively reduce the severity of the disease. mRNA is simply a storage vehicle for instructions that program cells to produce certain kinds of proteins. For the coronavirus vaccine, these proteins fight the virus molecules and protect the recipient against the disease.Apart from mRNA, there are dozen of other applications for biotechnology as well which are not limited to human health either. The sector is responsible for having saved countless lives over the past few decades simply by enabling the production of insulin. While insulin was initially produced by pigs, naturally there aren't enough pigs in the world to meet the needs of all diabetics. To solve this problem, biotechnology enabled insulin makers to clone the human gene responsible for making insulin in bacteria and produce as much of the life saving substance as needed. Apart from insulin, other sectors such as gene therapy, vaccine vegetables, and diagnosis are other areas that are a crucial part of the biotechnology industry.Story continuesMoving forward from human health, other areas benefiting from biotechnology are chemicals production and agriculture as organic compounds enable significant streamlining of these industries. These use cases naturally end up leading to stunning valuations of the industry. For instance, a research report from Grand View Research outlines that the biotechnology industry was worth a whopping $1.37 trillion last year. From 2023 until 2030, the industry is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.96% - a rather high rate when we consider the large size of the sector. This growth rate can ensure that the biotechnology industry is worth $3.88 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Grand View Research adds that one of the biggest sectors in the market was DNA sequencing, as it accounted for 16.5% of the market and grew due to the dropping costs of this technology. In terms of growth, the research firm believes that one of the fastest growing segments will be nanobiotechnology, which is expected to outpace the broader market in growth by increasing by 14.87%. Application wise, healthcare was unsurprisingly the largest sector as it represented more than half of the total market.One major drug in the biotechnology industry that is making waves these days is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s DUPIXENT. This is a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COP) - a devastating disease stemming from lung damage mostly in former smokers. At the firm's latest earnings call, management shared the remarkable impact that this drug is making, as they outlined:The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease.We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD.With these impressive details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top biotechnology stocks that hedge funds are piling into, out of which the top picks are Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Lower product margins, and higher freight and transportation costs are likely to have marred the company’s bottom line.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated witnessing inflation, an increased promotional environment, wage pressures, higher interest rates, supply-chain disruptions and more cautious consumer spending throughout fiscal 2024. This is expected to have weighed on the gross and operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hibbett this time.

109,e1f2b924-0920-3c86-8927-c662bc1bfc04,WYNN,2023-05-25,Wall Street Analysts See Wynn (WYNN) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-wynn-133007835.html,1684935007,STORY,['WYNN'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Wynn Resorts (WYNN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Wynn currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by nine brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the nine recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WYNNBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WYNNCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Wynn here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Wynn, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is WYNN Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wynn, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 35.7% over the past month to $1.43.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Wynn. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Wynn may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SPGI, has been reporting better-than-expected earnings performance in three of the four trailing quarters owing to the continued demand for the company’s innovative acquisitions and business information services. Shareholder-friendly policies also bode well. On the other hand, SPGI is likely to be troubled by low liquidity.Shares of SPGI have outperformed its industry in the past year. The company’s share increased 3.2% against the 0.2% decrease of its industry.S&amp;P Global Inc. PriceS&amp;P Global Inc. PriceS&amp;P Global Inc. price | S&amp;P Global Inc. QuoteS&amp;P Global reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Revenues of $3.16 billion surpassed the consensus estimate by 3.6% and improved 32.3% year over year, backed by the inclusion of IHS Markit businesses.Current Situation of SPGIThe increase in demand for business information services has been one of the success factors for S&amp;P Global.

Thailand has for many years hosted annual ""Cobra Gold"" training exercises with the United States.Those warm ties have, however, been strained by the Thai military's coups against elected governments in 2006 and 2014, and concerns about overtures by army-backed governments towards rival power China.Prapas said the air force would still replace its F-16 jets and the United States had offered the upgraded F-15 and F-16s models, which could be transferred faster.($1 = 33.8500 baht) (Reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat, Writing by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Martin Petty)]"

125,7292d1eb-0d3b-30be-a64f-26f9f99af191,JNJ,2023-05-25,10 Dementia Medications that are Approved or in Clinical Trials,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-dementia-medications-approved-clinical-174633835.html,1684950393,STORY,"['JNJ', 'BIIB']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 dementia medications that are approved or in clinical trials. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 dementia medications that are approved or in clinical trials.Advancements in medicine have absolutely changed the way we live right now, both in terms of quality of life and life expectancy. For 69 years, from 1950 to 2019, global life expectancy has continued to improve as incredible breakthroughs have been achieved in the medical world. However, a significant decline was witnessed in the last couple of years, especially in the United States, wiping out nearly a decade of gains across the world. The reason of course, was the Covid-19 pandemic which has so far resulted in nearly 7 million deaths. Of course, the life expectancy decline would have been much more significant had it not been for some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, which came up with viable vaccines in record time, allowing for billions of doses to be administered worldwide, and resulting in the World Health Organization declaring in 2023 that Covid-19 was no longer a global health emergency.10 Dementia Medications that are Approved or in Clinical Trialspikselstock/Shutterstock.comOne of the areas of focus for medicine has been, for many decades, dementia. While dementia is not a specific disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it refers to ""a general term for the impaired ability to remember, think, or make decisions that interferes with doing everyday activities. [...] Though dementia mostly affects older adults, it is not a part of normal aging."" The statistics for dementia are sobering; an estimate 5 million dementia patients lived in 2014 in the U.S. and by 2060, this number is expected to surge to 14 million.Worldwide, there are over 44 million dementia patients currently. While the disease is much more common in older patients, it isn't a typical sign of aging, which means that for many aging people, there are no signs of dementia present, as opposed to say, weakening muscles or bones or age-related memory issues, which are present in the vast majority of our aging population.Story continuesOne of the reasons the number of patients with dementia is expected to increase is because our life expectancy is continuously increasing. Barring the outlier impact of Covid-19, this trend is expected to continue in the near future, which means a greater percentage of the total population will be aging, and while dementia is not a direct result of aging, it is more common in older adults. Declining birth rates across many countries have also resulted in a higher concentration of older adults, such as in Japan. Dementia is also more likely to develop in those who have a family history such as parents or siblings who have had dementia, while even race plays a major role in this, with African Americans twice more likely to develop dementia as opposed to white, while Hispanics are 1.5 times more likely to develop dementia than whites.Many major companies including Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Eli Lilly and Company ( NYSE:LLY), are investing a huge amount of resources in dementia research, specifically for Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, there are currently 143 drugs in 172 clinical trials for treating Alzheimer's disease, which includes 31 agents in 47 trials in Phase 3, with disease-modifying therapies representing the bulk of total drugs in trial, at over 80%. This shows that the biggest pharma companies are taking the treatment of dementia very seriously, as it represents a potentially huge market, and companies which come up with successful solutions will be in the ascendancy to reap benefits from profits.As mentioned earlier, Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is one of the companies that is working on treating patients with Alzheimer's disease. According to tits website: ""Driven by our commitment to patients and our strong business foundation, Biogen remains dedicated to furthering Alzheimer’s disease research and treatment, aiming to help address the unmet needs in this devastating condition, with an emphasis on early-stage disease."" Thus it comes as no surprise that it is one of the companies developing dementia medications that are approved or in clinical trials.To determine dementia medications that are approved or in clinical trials, we headed over to the US Food and Drug Administration website for more information on clinical trials for drugs treating dementia or Alzheimer's disease. We also selected drugs which already exist and have received requisite approval previously, with additional data gatherer from the National Health Service. It is important to remember that there is currently no cure for dementia, which is why these drugs are only relevant for treating different types of symptoms and ailments that dementia causes. So, let's now take a look at the drugs which will hopefully relegate dementia to a nuisance rather than a life altering issue, and the companies working to make this happen, starting with:10. RexultiWhile Rexulti is primarily used for the treatment of depression, it is also used to treat agitation caused by dementia that may happen as a result of Alzheimer's disease. Side effects of taking the medication include dizziness, symptoms of the common cold, weight gain, and sleepiness.9. RisperidalRisperidone is sold under the brand name Risperdal, whose primary use is an anti-psychotic in the treatment of schizophrenia, is also used to treat some symptoms for patients with dementia, and is owned by the pharmaceutical arm of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Jannsen Pharmacueticals. In 2012, the company settled in 36 states against allegations relating to its marketing practices for the drug, costing the company approximately $181 million.8. MemantineMemantine is used to treat one of the most debilitating symptoms of dementia, memory loss. Used in the treatment of patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, and was first produced by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in 1968, initially as an anti-diabetic medication. One of the main provider of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of the drug is Reddy's Laboratories.7. RazadyneGalantamine, sold under the brand name Razadyne, is used to treat patients with mild to moderate dementia. According to the FDA, the drug is manufactured by one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world in Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).6. ExelonRivastigmine is sold under the brand name Exelon, and is used in the treatment of patients who have to deal with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia, and has been proven to be adept at controlling symptoms. None of the dementia medications that are approved or in trial currently cure dementia, but they do tend to treat the symptoms, to improve the quality of life of patients.Click to continue reading and see the 5 dementia medications that are approved or in trials.Suggested articles:30 Richest Cities in the United States in 202320 Richest Countries in EuropeTop 50 Richest Countries In The World By Net WorthDisclosure: None. 10 dementia medications that are approved or in trial is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Healthcare profit pools are projected to grow at a 4% CAGR from $654 billion in 2021 to $790 billion in 2026, as reported by McKinsey &amp; Company.The onset of the pandemic has brought several changes and transformations in the US healthcare system. The adoption of telehealth services accelerated post-pandemic to reduce the risks of exposure. According to a report by Deloitte, 68% of physicians offered virtual health options in 2022, compared with just 14% the prior year. The report further mentioned that 57% to 80% of patients prefer telehealth services. These shifting patient preferences are likely to have a lasting impact, resulting in the further growth of the telehealth sector. Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) estimated that the sector could bring $20 billion in US revenues by 2027. The analysis also projected a 30% annual revenue growth for top telehealth providers.Also read: 11 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowThe demand for healthcare-related products and services remains relatively stable despite economic conditions.

These were presented as late-breaking science at Heart Rhythm 2023 in New Orleans. The results confirm that the system provides the advantages of a device with lead outside the heart and continues to provide pause prevention pacing and anti-tachycardia pacing to avoid shocks with prolonged follow-ups.By providing a contemporary view of the real-world impact of ICDs, the EV ICD study underscores the importance of indicated patients receiving these potentially life-saving devices.About the EV ICD SystemThe Medtronic EV ICD system is an implantable defibrillator, which is designed to treat dangerously fast heart rhythms that can lead to sudden cardiac arrests. This is the first system that offers anti-tachycardia pacing, pause prevention pacing, and a device similar in size, shape and battery longevity to transvenous ICDs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStudy FindingsThe prospective study included real-world data from the Medtronic CareLink Network from 2013 to 2022, assessing time-to-first therapy in a contemporary cohort of ICD patients.Of the 299 implanted patients followed through an average of 17.1 months, an estimated 6.8% of patients showed to have experienced appropriate therapy by 18 months, with 19 patients experiencing 80 spontaneous, appropriately treated arrhythmic episodes. Of the discrete episodes treated with shock, 100% were successfully terminated.The rate of freedom from major EV ICD system-or-procedure-related complications through 18 months was 91.9%. The most common major complication was lead dislodgment, identified within 120 days post-implant, mostly related to the lead-anchoring technique. Inappropriate shocks occurred in 35 patients throughout all follow-ups.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global implantable cardioverter defibrillator market size was valued at $3.3 billion and is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.3% up to 2030.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for its Micra AV2 and Micra VR2 — the next generation of its industry-leading miniaturized, leadless pacemakers. The world's smallest pacemakers provide longer battery life and easier programming than prior Micra pacemakers while delivering the expanded benefits of leadless pacing compared to traditional pacemakers.In April 2023, Medtronic announced the FDA approval of its MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor, which requires no fingerstick while in SmartGuard technology.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Biotechnology is one of the hottest sectors these days. A handful of industries, such as space exploration, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, are making rapid leaps forward. For biotechnology, the greatest stimulus has been the coronavirus pandemic as the industry was solely responsible for bailing humanity out of the devastating crisis.Simply put, biotechnology is the use of biological raw materials to make vaccines and other products with them. This is in sharp contrast to traditional pharmaceutical applications that use plants and other raw materials to make medicines. Through biotechnology, firms such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) were able to develop the revolutionary messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines that were able to effectively reduce the severity of the disease. mRNA is simply a storage vehicle for instructions that program cells to produce certain kinds of proteins. For the coronavirus vaccine, these proteins fight the virus molecules and protect the recipient against the disease.Apart from mRNA, there are dozen of other applications for biotechnology as well which are not limited to human health either. The sector is responsible for having saved countless lives over the past few decades simply by enabling the production of insulin. While insulin was initially produced by pigs, naturally there aren't enough pigs in the world to meet the needs of all diabetics. To solve this problem, biotechnology enabled insulin makers to clone the human gene responsible for making insulin in bacteria and produce as much of the life saving substance as needed. Apart from insulin, other sectors such as gene therapy, vaccine vegetables, and diagnosis are other areas that are a crucial part of the biotechnology industry.Story continuesMoving forward from human health, other areas benefiting from biotechnology are chemicals production and agriculture as organic compounds enable significant streamlining of these industries. These use cases naturally end up leading to stunning valuations of the industry. For instance, a research report from Grand View Research outlines that the biotechnology industry was worth a whopping $1.37 trillion last year. From 2023 until 2030, the industry is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.96% - a rather high rate when we consider the large size of the sector. This growth rate can ensure that the biotechnology industry is worth $3.88 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Grand View Research adds that one of the biggest sectors in the market was DNA sequencing, as it accounted for 16.5% of the market and grew due to the dropping costs of this technology. In terms of growth, the research firm believes that one of the fastest growing segments will be nanobiotechnology, which is expected to outpace the broader market in growth by increasing by 14.87%. Application wise, healthcare was unsurprisingly the largest sector as it represented more than half of the total market.One major drug in the biotechnology industry that is making waves these days is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s DUPIXENT. This is a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COP) - a devastating disease stemming from lung damage mostly in former smokers. At the firm's latest earnings call, management shared the remarkable impact that this drug is making, as they outlined:The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease.We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD.With these impressive details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top biotechnology stocks that hedge funds are piling into, out of which the top picks are Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of key market players, global price trends, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on the global potash supply chain and the environmental impacts of potash mining and go directly to 5 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World.The term “potash” refers to a group of potassium bearing minerals and chemicals. Among its different varieties, the compound potassium chloride (Muriate of Potash) occupies the major share of the global potash market. According to research at the University of California, about 95% of the entire global potash supply is used in agriculture, while the rest is used to manufacture commercial and industrial products, such as detergents etc. Potash plays an important role in the fertilizer industry because potassium is an essential and irreplaceable nutrient for plant growth. Where potassium is deficient in soil, potash fertilizers can be used to rectify the problem and boost crop yields and quality.Some of the key players in the global potash market are the Canada-based Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) and the Chile-based Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM). Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) has emerged as the global market leader in the industry, with the capacity to produce over 20 million tons of potash. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) has over 2000 retail locations in over 7 countries and a distribution network to efficiently supply potash to approximately 40 countries around the world. The global potash prices peaked at above $1,000 per ton during the commodity boom in 2007-08. But since then, the average potash prices stood at around $350 per ton and are currently at around $645 per ton, according to a research at the University of Illinois. This current increase in prices could be attributed to the Russia-Ukraine war. According to the United States Geological Survey, Russia and Belarus have together accounted for a third of the global potash supply over the years. Following the Russian aggression in Ukraine since last year, the EU, the US and other countries have placed economic sanctions over Russia. Fertilizer products, including potash, were exempt from the said sanctions, however, the EU placed import quotas on potash from Russia. Following these sanctions and restrictions, Russia responded by suspending fertilizer exports to countries that it deemed unfriendly. Russia continued its exports to China, India, Brazil and other countries but its potash exports in 2022 were still down 30% from 2021. Story continuesSimilarly, Belarus produced over 7.6 million metric tons of potash in 2021. This declined significantly in 2022 because the country lost access to key shipping routes in Lithuania after U.S. sanctions on its state-owned company, JSC Belaruskali. The Lithuanian port of Klaipeda handled over 90% of Belarussian potash exports, however, after the said sanctions, the landlocked country has very few avenues to ship one of its key exports and sources of revenue. As a result of reduction in the global potash supplies, producers in Canada have announced to increase production to fill this gap. Canadian production capacity is expected to increase by 3 million tons per year by 2025. According to Saskatoon StarPhoenix, Pam Schwann, president of the Saskatchewan Mining Association has said: “With the invasion of Ukraine, we’ve seen a lot more countries and companies try to find secure, reliable and ethical producers of potash and many have turned their attention to Saskatchewan”This led to a record revenue of $11.9 billion, by the end of August 2022, for Canadian potash producers, eclipsing the previous record of $7.6 billion in 2021. However, potash mining can also have serious detrimental effects on the environment. It causes a decrease in species richness and alters the salinity gradient of freshwater ecosystems, as well as large-volume water consumption and contamination. The direct disposal of brine in rivers can affect aquatic fauna and cause biological degradation. Therefore, as invaluable as this resource is for the global food supply and economy, ethical and responsible practices should be adopted to mine it. That said, here is a list of 15 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World. 15 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World Methodology:There are 15 countries in the world that produce over 99% of the world’s potash and have a virtual monopoly in the industry. With potash being an essential and irreplaceable component of various fertilizers, these countries have enjoyed some hefty profits over the years. Some countries are producing this compound through mining from underground ore deposits, while others are producing it from salt lakes or brine obtained from the sea. To rank these countries for this article, we have referred to the Mineral Commodities Summaries 2023 report by the United States Geological Survey. 15. Iran Production of Potash in 2022: 37,000 metric tonsThe production of potash in Iran has increased significantly from 10,500 metric tons back in 2016, revealing massive growth in the industry. The mining complex of Khur in the central Isfahan province in Iran is the first potash mine in the country and contains the largest reserves of the compound in West Asia. There is even a “Potash Salt Village'' in the area, which has become a major tourist attraction over the years and even boasts a 25-meter high potash salt waterfall. There are also various lakes in the country with potash-bearing brine, such as the Rezayeh Lake. The salt is obtained from such lakes via the solar evaporation process. 14. United KingdomProduction of Potash in 2022: 99,200 metric tons The Boulby-mine, located in north-east England, was one of the world’s largest potash producers for many years and is the only source of potash in the UK. According to the British Geological Survey, production from the mine started commercially in 1976 and output increased steadily until it peaked at 943,000 metric tons in 2003, but since then, it has been in constant decline. The production of potash in the UK stood at 482,800 metric tons in 2016 and so the UK has emerged as a large importer of potash over the years, with 90% of it consumed in the production of fertilizers. 13. Uzbekistan Production of Potash in 2022: 210,000 metric tonsThe total production of potash in Uzbekistan stood at 83,000 metric tons in 2016 and has constantly grown over the years. The Tubegatan potash deposit, located in the south of the country, is a very important source of the compound. However, there have been reports of environmental degradation and pollution in the area, with more than 6 million tons of potash waste reportedly accumulated, since production began in 2010. 12. BrazilProduction of Potash in 2022: 270,000 metric tonsBrazil is the second-largest producer of potash in South America. However, being the breadbasket of the world, the country is also the second-largest consumer, as well as the fastest-growing market of the compound in the world and so it imports 96% of its required amount. The Toronto-based Brazil Potash Corp. is an important player in the industry, which is working on extracting potash in the Amazon. Its Autazes project is a key step towards self-reliance for the country but it has been faced by delays, due to litigation with the indigenous communities. 11. United States of AmericaProduction of Potash in 2022: 440,000 metric tonsAccording to the United States Geological Survey, the majority of the US production was from southeastern New Mexico, where two companies operated two underground mines and one deep-well solution mine. There were also two companies that operated three facilities in Utah. The country is also the third-largest consumer of potash in the world, with consumption estimated to have increased by 3% since 2021. One of the largest potash companies globally, The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) is based in Florida. With a workforce of around 1300, The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) currently has a market cap of $11.85 billion. The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) also owns the Colonsay mine in neighboring Canada. 10. SpainProduction of Potash in 2022: 450,000 metric tons Spain is the second-largest producer of potash in the EU, right after Germany. Potash is extracted from underground mines in the form of Sylvanite, a mixture of potash and salt found in different concentrations. ICL Iberia, a subsidiary of the ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) is a key player in the potash mining industry in Spain. Currently being the sole producer of potash in the country, the ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) exports 80% of its production to countries in the EU, Asia and the Americas. Another player entering the Spanish potash market is Highfield Resources, which is working to develop the Muga potash project in the country, thus potentially ending the absolute monopoly enjoyed by the ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL). 9. LaosProduction of Potash in 2022: 600,000 metric tonsAccording to a report, the existence of potash salts in the country was proven during the potash exploration campaign in the 1970s, by one single drill hole in the Vientiane basin, with the assistance of the USAID. Exploration and development of potash deposits has developed well over the years. The production of potash in Laos in 2016 was around 198,000 metric tons, revealing massive growth in the industry. A key player in the country’s industry is Asia Potash International Investment Co., Ltd., which has also been working on building a “Smart Potash Mine”, with the help of the Huawei Media Group. 8. ChileProduction of Potash in 2022: 850,000 metric tonsChile, with its substantial mineral wealth, is the largest producer of potash in South America. One of its companies, based in Santiago, Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is not only the largest producer of potash in the country but is also the biggest supplier of lithium in the world. The Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) produces its potash with reserves from Salar de Atacema, in the northern part of Chile and currently has a market cap of over $19.7 billion. Another big company operating in the country is Inspiration Mining. 7. Jordan Production of Potash in 2022: 1,700,000 metric tons Jordan produces its potash with brine from the Dead Sea, which has around 2 billion tons of potassium chloride. The potash production in the country in 2016 was around 1.2 million metric tons, revealing a 39% increase over the years. One of the largest producers of potash in Jordan is the Arab Potash Company, with a market cap of around $4 billion. The APC has the capacity to produce a total of 2.5 million tons per year of potash through its three production plants in Jordan. Another key player operating in the country is Jordan Phosphate Mines Company Ltd. 6. IsraelProduction of Potash in 2022: 2,500,000 metric tonsIsrael, along with Jordan, also recovers its potash from the Dead Sea, one of the saltiest bodies of water on the planet. The production in Israel in 2016 was around 2.1 million metric tons, revealing a growth of 19% in the industry. A key player in the market is ICL Dead Sea, a subsidiary of ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL), which through the Dead Sea Works Project, conducts its operations at the southern basin of the Dead Sea and produces potash, along with bromine. These products are then transported to customers in Israel and around the world. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World.Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Potash Companies in the World15 Largest Fertilizer Companies in the World 10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

136,17b5a3c9-be73-384d-900e-72a4258e2c50,WMB,2023-05-25,3 Oil Pipeline Stocks to Gain Despite Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-pipeline-stocks-gain-124600247.html,1684932360,STORY,"['KMI', 'WMB', '^GSPC', 'MPLX']","[Although the midstream energy business is less exposed to oil and gas price volatility, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry’s outlook is still subjected to uncertainties. Due to conservative capital spending by upstream players and possibilities of soft fuel demand, production volumes could get dented, hurting demand for partnerships’ midstream assets.Despite the uncertainties, pipeline players are better off than upstream and downstream firms since the partnerships generate stable fee-based revenues from their long-term contracts with shippers. The industry frontrunners include Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry comprises companies that own and operate midstream energy infrastructure assets. The properties consist of extensive pipeline networks that transport crude oil, liquids and natural gas. The midstream energy players are also involved in the processing and storing natural gas. The companies have interests in natural gas distribution utilities, serving millions of retail customers across North America. Some companies are ramping up investments in renewable energy and power transmission businesses. The firms invested in wind farms, solar energy operations, geothermal projects and hydroelectric facilities. Thus, with a diversified portfolio of renewable energy projects, the firms have room to generate extra cash flows in addition to stable fee-based revenues from the transportation assets.What's Shaping the Future of Oil &amp; Gas - Production and Pipelines Industry?Soft Pipeline Demand: Inflationary environment is probably spurring a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which could hurt fuel demand. The uncertainty in fuel demand is likely to affect the production of the commodity, which in turn will lower the demand for oil pipeline assets of the partnerships.Story continuesLower Fee-Based Revenues: Soft demand for midstream assets might ultimately lead to lower fee-based revenues for the master limited partnerships. Also, to sail through soft demand for pipeline networks, several energy players with midstream presence will likely have no option but to offer discounts to shippers.Shift to Renewables: Energy majors will increasingly face challenges in providing sustainable energy to the world while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to address the issue of climate change, there will be a gradual shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy. This will lower the demand for the partnerships’ pipeline and storage networks for oil and natural gas.Explorers’ Conservative Capital Spending: Oil and gas exploration and production companies are facing heightened pressure from investors to focus on stockholders’ returns rather than production. This is hindering the production of commodities, thereby denting pipeline and storage assets.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #202, which places it in the bottom 20% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the cloudy prospects, we present a few stocks that investors can retain or keep an eye on, given their solid potential. But before that, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and its current valuation.Industry Lags Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production &amp; Pipelines industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has fallen 9.7% over this period against the 5.8% rise of the S&amp;P 500 and 7.8% decline of the broader sector.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing oil and gas production &amp; pipeline stocks, the industry is currently trading at 11.91X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.71X. It is also above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.76X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.89X, as low as 8.81X and at a median of 13.07X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio3 Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnMPLX LP: MPLX generates stable cashflows and has lower exposure to commodity price volatility since it is the operator of midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets. It also generates cashflows from a relatively stable fuels distribution business.Over the past seven days, MPLX has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023. The partnership, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has attractive organic growth capital projects and is pursuing low-carbon opportunities.

""What we’re currently doing is deploying where there is that need and a request.”Boeing Chief Safety Officer Mike Delaney said that while it's up to aviation regulators to ensure airlines are ready to operate new aircraft types, having Boeing pilots on the ground allows the company to address practices that may be concerning.""We've had to make hard recommendations to some airlines, no doubt about that,"" he said. ""All of them have accepted either our recommendation ... and in some cases we have offered additional resources from our company to help them do it.""While Boeing historically has sent engineering and maintenance experts to embed with airlines, sending pilots on a semi-permanent basis to answer questions about flight operations procedures is a new endeavor for the company.Boeing hopes to recruit additional flight operations representatives - who are mostly former retired airline pilots with more than 13,000 flight hours under their belt, Pittman said.However, airlines' demand for training is high, and the older age of Boeing's pool of existing representatives leads to natural challenges in recruiting and retaining a workforce.""One challenge is that pilots are a scare commodity,"" Delaney said. “This is going to be a continuous (effort) trying to keep the pipeline full.""Story continuesDelaney and Pittman spoke to reporters during a media event tied to the roll out of Boeing's second annual safety report, required by a 2021 legal settlement over the 737 MAX crashes which killed 346 people.Other initiatives highlighted by Boeing officials included a machine learning algorithm developed by the company and the Federal Aviation Administration, which scours ""service difficulty reports"" that describes aircraft system malfunctions and identifies trends in the data.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Washington; Editing by Lincoln Feast)]"

He is smart and poised, but Princeton was hardly a foregone conclusion. The child of immigrants from Cuernavaca, Mexico, he is the first member of his family to go to college. Pliego plans to focus his studies on molecular biology and public policy. As he puts it: He wants to fix things.Recently, Pliego visited Illumina's San Diego headquarters to meet Princeton alums and learn more about genomics. He's one of the first fellows of the yearlong mentorship program San Diego Squared (SD2) and a recipient of the Illumina SD2 STEM Scholar Award. This visit was a chance for him to celebrate his accomplishments and make academic and professional connections.""I'm really interested in genomics and understanding different genes in the body to diagnose and treat disease,"" Pliego says. ""This visit, I got to meet a lot of people who do that work and see how Illumina is such a vibrant community. I really enjoyed it.""SD2 is looking for starsSD2, a grant recipient of the Illumina Corporate Foundation, connects high school students from underrepresented communities to hands-on STEM education, mentorship, and other resources.""We are hyper-local, going into high schools and colleges to identify diverse, incredibly talented students who have shown excellence in STEM,"" says H. Puentes, co-founder, president, and CEO of SD2. ""We give them front-row access to STEM opportunities and help them develop a network who can be their allies, their support, and their advocates.""The organization adopts a comprehensive strategy to support the whole student, providing whatever they need to succeed-from books to transportation to food stipends. SD2 wants to build their confidence, teach them about STEM industries, and show them they belong here.""We believe talent lives in all communities,"" Puentes says, ""but historically, STEM fields haven't been looking in diverse areas. Imagine the incredible talent we will find when we go places we've never looked before. Alejandro embodies that, but he's not alone. We've got a ton more Alejandros out there.""Story continuesA day at IlluminaDuring his visit, Pliego toured Illumina headquarters, met with several Princeton alums-including Chief Public Affairs Officer John Frank-and chatted with Chief People Officer and SD2 Board Member Aimee Hoyt.""I was really impressed with how Alejandro approached these meetings,"" Puentes says. ""He's not intimidated at all. I don't think I could have done it at that age. Illumina has been a great partner with SD2. They've been at the table, sleeves rolled up, since day one.""Pliego was impressed by how welcoming the people at Illumina were. ""Being able to have these conversations, that was big,"" he says. ""It helps me grow my confidence and see what this world is really like.""He applied to Princeton through QuestBridge, a nonprofit that connects students from low-income families to elite universities, and was awarded a full scholarship. He even wrote about Illumina in one of his college essays, recounting an earlier meeting with an employee who had a similar background. Eventually, he'd like to start his own company.""I want to be able to help people, specifically underrepresented minorities and underprivileged kids, get the necessities they need in life,"" Pliego says. ""Listening to employees from different companies in this industry and understanding why they chose their career paths gives me perspective into the different missions companies have and how I might fit.""Illumina is committed to inspiring the next generation of genomic leaders, and we are working to nurture a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce for the future.

149,eadf8364-1dda-369a-915b-6102077211ad,SO,2023-05-25,"Georgia nuclear rebirth arrives 7 years late, $17B over cost",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/georgia-nuclear-rebirth-arrives-7-041013269.html,1684987813,STORY,['SO'],"[WAYNESBORO, Ga. (AP) — Two nuclear reactors in Georgia were supposed to herald a nuclear power revival in the United States. But the project is seven years late and $17 billion over budget as Georgia Power Co. announced the first new reactor at its Plant Vogtle could reach full electrical output by Saturday.They’re the first U.S. reactors built from scratch in decades — and maybe the most expensive power plant ever. Georgia electric customers have already paid billions, and state regulators will ultimately decide if they’re on the hook for billions more.Some of the key promises of Vogtle — like building modules offsite and shipping them for cheaper on-site assembly — did not pan out. Construction delays drove Westinghouse Electric Co., a titan of American industrial history, into bankruptcy when the company couldn’t absorb overruns.And the lessons could be important because government officials and some utilities are again looking to nuclear power to alleviate climate change by generating electricity without burning natural gas, coal and oil.Vogtle's new Unit 3 began generating power in March and is scheduled to reach commercial operation by June. Unit 4 is next door on the same rural Burke County site 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Augusta, along with two older reactors. It's supposed to be finished by early 2024.Georgia Power and its parent, Atlanta-based Southern Co., say the reactors are a triumph. Chris Womack, before he ascended from Georgia Power to become Southern Co. CEO, told The Associated Press that Vogtle is “absolutely” a success, arguing reliable power and cheap fuel costs will benefit the utility's 2.7 million customers for decades.“We recognize the upfront cost and some of the challenges that we faced,"" Womack said in January at Vogtle. ""But yeah, this is value. This is value contribution to customers, to the state, to the energy grid, to bringing back the nuclear industry and showing that we can do hard things.”Story continuesAs with Vogtle, supporters of future nuclear plants promise new-and-improved designs can be mass-produced at reliable prices. But Vogtle opponents scorn renewed nuclear ambitions.“I don’t see how anybody in their right mind cannot avoid saying ‘Well, what evidence do you have?’” said David Schlissel, a utility analyst who testified against Units 3 and 4 after fighting the first two Vogtle reactors in the 1970s. They also finished fabulously late and over budget.In Georgia, almost every electric customer will pay for Vogtle. Georgia Power currently owns 45.7% of the reactors. Smaller shares are owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp., which provides electricity to member-owned cooperatives, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Some Florida and Alabama utilities have also contracted to buy Vogtle's power.Currently, the owners are projected to pay $31 billion in capital and financing costs, Associated Press calculations show.Japan's Toshiba Corp., which then owned Westinghouse, paid $3.7 billion to the Vogtle owners to walk away from a guarantee to build the reactors at a fixed price after overruns forced electric industry pioneer Westinghouse into bankruptcy in 2017. Add that to Vogtle’s price and the total nears $35 billion.A U.S. Department of Energy report details Vogtle's other failings: Work began with incomplete designs and managers repeatedly failed to realistically schedule tasks. Experienced workers were in short supply and defective work often had to be redone. Workers quit for other jobs and the COVID-19 pandemic led to high absenteeism.Calculations show Vogtle's electricity will never be cheaper than other sources Georgia Power could have chosen, even after the federal government reduced borrowing costs by guaranteeing repayment of $12 billion in loans.Yet regulators say Vogtle was the right choice.“Vogtle 3 and 4 will be a success not only for Georgia but for our country the moment that they go into service,"" said Tricia Pridemore, who chairs the elected Public Service Commission of five Republicans. She argues nuclear power provides clean energy with prices immune from international market swings, and that building Vogtle increased U.S. nuclear engineering know-how.Customers are already paying. Regulators estimate Georgia Power will collect $4.1 billion in advance charges, or $913 for every ratepayer. Some cooperative customers are also paying — nearly $500 million through March.Georgia Power's residential customers will begin paying an additional $3.78 per month as soon as Unit 3 achieves commercial operation. But the final bill won't come until Unit 4 is complete. Commissioners must then decide how much of Georgia Power's spending was prudent while disallowing wasted amounts. Commissioners earlier approved $5.7 billion as prudent, but Bryan Jacob of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said “management failures” should be scrutinized.“Ratepayers shouldn’t foot the bill for things that management could have done right in the first place,"" Jacob said.Critics fear Georgia Power will profit from mistakes. Staff estimates show Georgia Power could earn an extra $9.4 billion in profit over 60 years if allowed to charge for all spending. Customers could pay $35.7 billion overall, $20.5 billion more than originally projected.“If they can get away with it, they benefit from screwing up,” said Schlissel, the utility analyst.Pridemore said it may be unfair to penalize Georgia Power for overruns beyond its control, but dismissed complaints about undue profits. “I’m very familiar with the mistakes,” Pridemore said, referring to commission monitoring of Vogtle construction.Womack said Georgia Power won't try to collect for all overruns, promising a “balanced” outcome. Southern Co. has written off $3.26 billion in Vogtle losses since 2018, suggesting it won't recoup those costs.“We’ll look at the best interests of our customers, but also look at the investments that we’ve made here and what’s good for the company,"" Womack said.American utilities have heeded Vogtle's missteps, shelving plans for 24 other reactors proposed between 2007 and 2009. Two half-built reactors in South Carolina were abandoned.But even opponents of Vogtle say the United States can't achieve carbon-free electricity without nuclear power. Jacob's group modeled how Southern Co. could achieve zero-carbon generation by 2035.“It was very difficult for us to make the math work without nuclear,"" Jacob said.Reactors can run almost constantly, unlike wind and solar generation, and uranium fuel adds little cost.“It’s one of the first units that come online, because from an operational expense, it’s the lowest cost energy that’s available,” Womack said.So nuclear proponents are trying again. A multinational partnership including the Tennessee Valley Authority seeks to build scaled-down reactors designed by General Electric and Hitachi. The first small modular reactor, under construction east of Toronto, could be complete by 2028. TVA may build one near Oak Ridge, Tennessee.“Worldwide we need to double the amount of nuclear capacity, possibly even triple it by 2050 in order to meet our net-zero carbon goals,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy Kathryn Huff said in Washington in March, celebrating the partnership.Some ideas are similar to Vogtle, including standardized designs and parts. Costs are rising for other designs planned for Idaho and Wyoming. Still, supporters believe building smaller reactors will be less daunting.Jay Wileman, CEO of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, acknowledges any nuclear revival must overcome past problems.“Nuclear has to have a seat at the table, but we’ve got to earn our seat at the table,” Wileman said in March. ""And to do that, we’ve got to be on schedule, on budget, and it’s got to be a competitive cost.”But Vogtle observers view those pledges dimly.“The industry has no track record of being right,” Schlissel said.]"

152,b5908dc5-0b74-3d51-9fdd-0810dbe71eb0,ANSS,2023-05-25,15 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-artificial-intelligence-ai-202045257.html,1684959645,STORY,"['AMD', 'SAP', 'AMZN', 'PATH', 'GOOGL', 'S', 'IBM', 'VRSK', 'ANSS', 'ACN', 'MSFT', 'ADSK', 'ORCL']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy according to hedge funds. For more top AI stocks, head on over to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. The hottest trend in technology right now is artificial intelligence. This is simply due to the fact that for the general consumer, artificial intelligence is mostly associated with sci-fi grade technology with the potential to create entities with human like intelligence and response. However, until most of 2022, such technologies were not available to captivate the public attention. Most chatbots were rather rudimentary and lacked the ability to provide detailed responses.However, all this changed with the release of ChatGPT, a conversational assistant trained on vast amounts of data and capable of generating human like responses to queries. ChatGPT set the internet on fire, and within days and weeks after its initial and public release, all tech and non tech publications were simply gushing about the assistant. As is the case with hype, it often goes far beyond what logic might suggest, and soon we were being warned that professionals such as lawyers might have to switch careers as a virtual assistant can provide better services.All this hype has made everyone forget what artificial intelligence really is. Simply put, AI is the use of complex mathematical techniques to use a set of inputs, plug them in an equation, and then determine the most likely set of outcomes. So, if you ask ChatGPT about companies with reusable rockets, it will sift through its data to determine which are the most likely matches and likely give you an answer that includes SpaceX.This utility of using large scale data analysis to generate a likely set of outputs provides artificial intelligence with far more utility than a simple chatbot. One of the best use cases of artificial intelligence that does not involve talking is autonomous driving. This involves feeding a computer in a car data through a variety of sensors such as LiDAR sensors, and programming it in such a way that it is able to make decisions that mimic human behavior like knowing when to stop and when to turn. Building on this, the consulting firm McKinsey takes a look at other sectors that can use AI. Its report for the 2022 use cases for AI shows that a variety of sectors such as robotic process automation, knowledge graphs, facial recognition, and recommender systems are using artificial intelligence as well. Functionally speaking, McKinsey reports that the largest users of artificial intelligence are service operators, customer service analytics, and customer generation and lead generation platforms.Story continuesOne firm that leads in the customer services arena is Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). It provides customer engagement and analytics platforms. During its earnings call for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023, its executives shared the inside scoop on Salesforce's Einstein GPT - the world's first generative language artificial intelligence platform for customer relationship management and details for other plans to integrate AI into the overall business.During the event, they shared:EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack. And then there’s another way we’re opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customers’, as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, I’ve been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while it’s inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldn’t be more excited about the future. To wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. We’re making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well.Given these explosive use cases, it's important to look at a wide list of firms currently developing and deploying the AI technology. Some topics AI picks from hedge funds include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best AI stocks, we first made a list of all firms that are developing and have deployed the technology.

Roc360 said it didn't purchase loans already made or loan-servicing operations. Pricing terms weren't disclosed.The transaction is the second real-estate-related transaction for PacWest this week. On Monday the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based institution said it would sell a $2.7 billion real-estate construction loan portfolio to Kennedy Wilson Holdings.The new deal announced Wednesday, however, failed to lift PacWest's stock. It was down more than 3% in morning trading. Stocks of other regional lenders were also lower, including Western Alliance (WAL) and Zions (ZION).PacWest was among the regional banks that came under intense pressure following the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank as depositors pulled money and investors punished its stock.It lost 17% of its deposits in the first quarter and posted a loss of $1.2 billion. Earlier this month it said it was exploring strategic actions such as asset sales.It has also become a favorite among short sellers placing bets that the value of its shares would decline. PacWest stock currently has the most short interest among regional banks as a percentage of its publicly available shares, according to market analytics firm S3.But PacWest and other regional banks have rallied in recent weeks as some investors became more convinced the worst of the industry chaos might be over.PacWest's stock has now rallied more than 33% in the last five days.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Biotechnology is one of the hottest sectors these days. A handful of industries, such as space exploration, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, are making rapid leaps forward. For biotechnology, the greatest stimulus has been the coronavirus pandemic as the industry was solely responsible for bailing humanity out of the devastating crisis.Simply put, biotechnology is the use of biological raw materials to make vaccines and other products with them. This is in sharp contrast to traditional pharmaceutical applications that use plants and other raw materials to make medicines. Through biotechnology, firms such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) were able to develop the revolutionary messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines that were able to effectively reduce the severity of the disease. mRNA is simply a storage vehicle for instructions that program cells to produce certain kinds of proteins. For the coronavirus vaccine, these proteins fight the virus molecules and protect the recipient against the disease.Apart from mRNA, there are dozen of other applications for biotechnology as well which are not limited to human health either. The sector is responsible for having saved countless lives over the past few decades simply by enabling the production of insulin. While insulin was initially produced by pigs, naturally there aren't enough pigs in the world to meet the needs of all diabetics. To solve this problem, biotechnology enabled insulin makers to clone the human gene responsible for making insulin in bacteria and produce as much of the life saving substance as needed. Apart from insulin, other sectors such as gene therapy, vaccine vegetables, and diagnosis are other areas that are a crucial part of the biotechnology industry.Story continuesMoving forward from human health, other areas benefiting from biotechnology are chemicals production and agriculture as organic compounds enable significant streamlining of these industries. These use cases naturally end up leading to stunning valuations of the industry. For instance, a research report from Grand View Research outlines that the biotechnology industry was worth a whopping $1.37 trillion last year. From 2023 until 2030, the industry is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.96% - a rather high rate when we consider the large size of the sector. This growth rate can ensure that the biotechnology industry is worth $3.88 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Grand View Research adds that one of the biggest sectors in the market was DNA sequencing, as it accounted for 16.5% of the market and grew due to the dropping costs of this technology. In terms of growth, the research firm believes that one of the fastest growing segments will be nanobiotechnology, which is expected to outpace the broader market in growth by increasing by 14.87%. Application wise, healthcare was unsurprisingly the largest sector as it represented more than half of the total market.One major drug in the biotechnology industry that is making waves these days is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s DUPIXENT. This is a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COP) - a devastating disease stemming from lung damage mostly in former smokers. At the firm's latest earnings call, management shared the remarkable impact that this drug is making, as they outlined:The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease.We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD.With these impressive details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top biotechnology stocks that hedge funds are piling into, out of which the top picks are Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

The agreement will allow the development of up to seven programs.Per the terms, Life Edit will receive an upfront cash payment and is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones of $335 million for each of the first two development programs under the collaboration and up to $250 million for each of the following five development programs, as well as tiered royalties on global net sales. Novo Nordisk will be responsible for all research and development costs.Novo Nordisk will make an equity investment in ElevateBio, Life Edit’s parent company, as part of ElevateBio’s $401 million Series D financing.Shares of Novo Nordisk have gained 20.7% in the year so far compared with the industry’s rise of 1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, shares were down 4.13% on May 23, following the publication of encouraging data on Pfizer’s PFE investigational drug danuglipron for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in the JAMA Network medical journal. In a phase II randomized clinical study in 411 adults with type 2 diabetes, danuglipron reduced glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose (at all doses) and body weight (at the highest doses) at week 16 compared with placebo.Investors were impressed, as the weight loss observed with danuglipron is of a similar magnitude to that observed in the phase II data for oral semaglutide. Consequently, Pfizer’s shares were up but Novo Nordisk’s shares were down, as the successful development of danuglipron will pose competition to Novo Nordisk’s obesity care drugs.Story continuesNovo Nordisk’s injectable semaglutide 2.4 mg is already approved under the brand name Wegovy for obesity.The company also announced positive results from a phase IIIa study, OASIS 1, in the global OASIS program for a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide in obesity. The study achieved its primary endpoint, with people showing statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with oral semaglutide 50 mg compared with placebo.NVO also has another approved drug, Saxenda (liraglutide), for obesity care.Novo Nordisk's first-quarter 2023 earnings met estimates, while revenues missed the same.

160,35b59496-cf08-3556-9b18-0a751ac8b74f,PFE,2023-05-25,US Debt-Ceiling Crisis Looms: How Will It Impact Medical Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-debt-ceiling-crisis-looms-135600773.html,1684936560,STORY,"['UNH', 'PFE', 'HCA']","[The United States is facing a looming debt-ceiling crisis that could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is the total amount the U.S. government is allowed to borrow to finance its expenditure, such as paying salaries and welfare allowances. On Jan 19, the United States hit its debt ceiling limit of $31.4 trillion, leading to a standoff between the White House and Congress over how to raise or suspend the limit, per a Reuters article. A continued impasse related to the debt-ceiling crisis will impact all sectors. The medical companies may face challenges as government healthcare spending may get reduced or halted without a resolution.Probable Impact of the CrisisU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the country could default on its debt as early as Jun 1, 2023 if the impasse is not resolved. A default would mean that the United States would fail to pay its creditors, such as foreign governments and investors, who hold U.S. Treasury bonds. This could trigger a financial crisis that would have a ripple effect across the world, impacting markets, trade and currencies. A potential default will also have significant implication for the healthcare industry, with the government focusing more on repaying its debt than healthcare-related spending. The default may also impact Social Security and unemployment insurance benefits, leading to lower or delayed medical expenses by patients.Factors Causing High DebtThe debt-ceiling crisis is part of an ongoing political debate within Congress about federal government spending and the national debt that the U.S. government accrues. The United States has had large budget deficits for years, meaning that it spends more than it collects in taxes. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government brought in $4.90 trillion but spent $6.27 trillion, with a net budget deficit of $1.38 trillion (the fourth highest of the 21st century).Story continuesThe main drivers of federal spending are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Other expenses of the government comprise discretionary spending, which also includes defense. A portion of the budget is also spent on paying interest on the debt, which is expected to rise further as debt grows.Here we discuss three medical stocks that may be potentially impacted by the crisis going forward:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth Group UNH is the largest health insurer in the United States, serving more than 150 million customers through its various plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. A default may result in a potential disruption in UNH’s revenue stream and cash flow. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have declined 9.6% so far this year.HCA Healthcare HCA, the largest for-profit hospital operator in the United States, owns and operates 186 hospitals and 121 freestanding surgery centers across 20 states and the United Kingdom. HCA could get delayed payments from Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 40% of its net revenues in case of a default. Shares of HCA Healthcare have gained 11.6% so far this year.Pfizer PFE, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, produces and sells a wide range of drugs and vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. A default may affect PFE’s ability to collect payments from government agencies and programs, such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration. Shares of Pfizer have lost 22.6% so far this year.UnitedHealth Group, HCA Healthcare and Pfizer all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Debt Ceiling HistoryPer a Reuters article, the United States has raised its debt ceiling 78 times since 1960, usually without much controversy. However, in recent years, some lawmakers have used the debt ceiling as a leverage point to demand spending cuts or policy changes from the opposing party. This resulted in several near-default situations and government shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2019.Current ScenarioIn the current impasse, Republicans have proposed cutting spending back to 2022 levels as a precondition to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats have insisted on a ""clean bill"" without preconditions, as had been the case in raising the ceiling three times during the Trump administration.President Joe Biden has urged Congress to act swiftly and responsibly to avoid a default that would harm millions of Americans and damage the country's reputation and creditworthiness. He has also ruled out invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which some legal scholars argue gives him the authority to bypass Congress and raise the debt limit unilaterally. Biden has said he does not want to create a constitutional crisis over a fiscal one.As the deadline approaches, both sides are under pressure to reach a compromise or face the consequences of a historic default that could plunge the world into a new recession.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The industry is also a significant and crucial part of the US economy. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, US healthcare spending reached $4.3 trillion in 2021 and accounted for 18.3% of the national GDP. Given this growing healthcare spending, analysts have presented a positive outlook for the sector in the coming years as well. Healthcare profit pools are projected to grow at a 4% CAGR from $654 billion in 2021 to $790 billion in 2026, as reported by McKinsey &amp; Company.The onset of the pandemic has brought several changes and transformations in the US healthcare system. The adoption of telehealth services accelerated post-pandemic to reduce the risks of exposure. According to a report by Deloitte, 68% of physicians offered virtual health options in 2022, compared with just 14% the prior year. The report further mentioned that 57% to 80% of patients prefer telehealth services. These shifting patient preferences are likely to have a lasting impact, resulting in the further growth of the telehealth sector. Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) estimated that the sector could bring $20 billion in US revenues by 2027. The analysis also projected a 30% annual revenue growth for top telehealth providers.Also read: 11 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowThe demand for healthcare-related products and services remains relatively stable despite economic conditions.

For more top AI stocks, head on over to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. The hottest trend in technology right now is artificial intelligence. This is simply due to the fact that for the general consumer, artificial intelligence is mostly associated with sci-fi grade technology with the potential to create entities with human like intelligence and response. However, until most of 2022, such technologies were not available to captivate the public attention. Most chatbots were rather rudimentary and lacked the ability to provide detailed responses.However, all this changed with the release of ChatGPT, a conversational assistant trained on vast amounts of data and capable of generating human like responses to queries. ChatGPT set the internet on fire, and within days and weeks after its initial and public release, all tech and non tech publications were simply gushing about the assistant. As is the case with hype, it often goes far beyond what logic might suggest, and soon we were being warned that professionals such as lawyers might have to switch careers as a virtual assistant can provide better services.All this hype has made everyone forget what artificial intelligence really is. Simply put, AI is the use of complex mathematical techniques to use a set of inputs, plug them in an equation, and then determine the most likely set of outcomes. So, if you ask ChatGPT about companies with reusable rockets, it will sift through its data to determine which are the most likely matches and likely give you an answer that includes SpaceX.This utility of using large scale data analysis to generate a likely set of outputs provides artificial intelligence with far more utility than a simple chatbot. One of the best use cases of artificial intelligence that does not involve talking is autonomous driving. This involves feeding a computer in a car data through a variety of sensors such as LiDAR sensors, and programming it in such a way that it is able to make decisions that mimic human behavior like knowing when to stop and when to turn. Building on this, the consulting firm McKinsey takes a look at other sectors that can use AI. Its report for the 2022 use cases for AI shows that a variety of sectors such as robotic process automation, knowledge graphs, facial recognition, and recommender systems are using artificial intelligence as well. Functionally speaking, McKinsey reports that the largest users of artificial intelligence are service operators, customer service analytics, and customer generation and lead generation platforms.Story continuesOne firm that leads in the customer services arena is Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). It provides customer engagement and analytics platforms. During its earnings call for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023, its executives shared the inside scoop on Salesforce's Einstein GPT - the world's first generative language artificial intelligence platform for customer relationship management and details for other plans to integrate AI into the overall business.During the event, they shared:EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack. And then there’s another way we’re opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customers’, as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, I’ve been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while it’s inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldn’t be more excited about the future. To wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. We’re making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well.Given these explosive use cases, it's important to look at a wide list of firms currently developing and deploying the AI technology. Some topics AI picks from hedge funds include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best AI stocks, we first made a list of all firms that are developing and have deployed the technology.

Leaders say they have already diverted 550 pounds of food waste from the landfill. The food waste reduction program is helping students and staff at Madison Metropolitan School District cut food waste and increase sustainability.Sustain Dane, a nonprofit organization focused on sustainability and wellbeing in Dane County, Wisconsin, used a $20,000 grant from Virent, a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, to launch the innovative program, and they are already seeing progress.""MMSD is moving forward with many projects to lessen environmental impact and educate and inspire staff and students through responsible practices,"" said Josh Perkins, Director of Food and Nutrition at Madison Metropolitan School District. ""This work, supporting mealtime composting and recycling in schools, will play an important part, and we are excited to see it unfold and expand in the district.""The program empowers students, staff and families to be active stewards of the environment through education and engagement. Beginning during the 2021-2022 school year, Sustain Dane worked with five elementary schools to explore sustainability solutions in the classroom and cafeteria. Sustain Dane used the funding from Virent to start recycling milk cartons and conduct food waste audits, which includes teaching students how to sort food into buckets that separate liquid, cartons and food waste from trash and then weighing the buckets. Since the project started, Sustain Dane's waste audits and education on recycling and food waste reduction have reached more than 2,600 students from five schools in the district.Story continuesPromising pilot at ShorewoodIn November 2022, Shorewood Elementary was one of the first schools in the program to launch a composting program and since then has diverted over 550 pounds of food waste from the landfill. The food waste goes to Green Box Compost, a local composting service that uses an in-vessel aerobic composting system to turn food scraps into fertile compost. Piloting this system at Shorewood has proven that composting pick up at a large elementary school is feasible.""This pilot program for school composting is seen as a model and resource for other area elementary schools,"" said Claire Oleksiak, Executive Director at Sustain Dane. ""We have started discussions with other schools with higher volumes of food waste and hope to launch composting at another school by the end of this school year.""To help grow the programs, student leaders created intercom announcements for their school about the launch of composting. They were inspired to start a Green Team at school to share why it's important to be mindful of recycling and food waste and how everyone can be part of the solution for a greener environment.""This is something very important because we are one of two schools that get this honor. If we do well, other schools will get to compost too."" said one of the student leaders. ""The compost will supply nutrients for other plants to grow.

STNE and Varex Imaging Corp. VREX.5 Valuable Price-to-Book Stocks to Boost Your PortfolioIt’s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than their actual worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.For narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank, General Motors, Unum Group, StoneCo Ltd. and Varex Imaging Corp. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

174,21e3495a-4f37-3975-879a-4577f0a049b4,GM,2023-05-25,Billionaire Cliff Asness 2023 Portfolio: Top 10 Blue Chip Value Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-cliff-asness-2023-portfolio-163717021.html,1684946237,STORY,"['CVX', 'TOL', 'MMM', 'GM', 'VZ']","[In this article, we discuss the top 10 blue chip value stocks from billionaire Cliff Asness' 2023 portfolio. If you want to see more of billionaire Asness’ blue chip value stocks, go to Billionaire Cliff Asness 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Blue Chip Value Stocks.Cliff Asness, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at AQR Capital Management, believes that the three-decade streak of US stock markets outperforming the global equities market could be coming to an end. He highlighted the fact that in the last three decades, the US stock markets have become relatively overvalued compared to their peers from the developed world. This can be gauged by the fact that the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of US stocks was at an all-time high valuation against their European and Asian peers in 2021 and is still hovering around the same levels. These views were expressed by the billionaire in an article published in The Journal of Portfolio Management on April 28.Mr. Asness believes that international equities become an attractive proposition when US equities are in decline. This hypothesis is backed by empirical evidence, as international equities have outperformed US equities in 96% of cases when US equity returns were below 6% and in 100% of cases when returns fell below 4%. This observation could be used towards building an effective investment strategy with the US equity markets expected to report weak returns in the coming years due to economic and political turmoil impacting them. The potential benefits of diversifying beyond US equities have also been reiterated by UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele.Mr. Asness has a rich experience in the equity markets as he played an important role in developing a mathematical model to identify patterns in the stock market during the early 1990s when he was part of the quantitative research team at Goldman Sachs. At the same time, he was completing his PhD in finance at the University of Chicago. By the mid-1990s, a team under the leadership of Mr. Asness started an internal hedge fund at Goldman Sachs that generated a healthy return of 140% for its investors during the first year of its operations. This fund was eventually launched by the diversified financial services firm as the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund, and within a short span of two years, Mr. Asness was leading the quantitative research team and was responsible for managing $7 billion.Story continuesIn 1998, Mr. Asness embarked on a new chapter and started AQR Capital Management as a co-founder alongside David Kabiller, John Liew, and Robert Krail. AQR Capital Management soon became one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. In 2011, the hedge fund made a transition from being a quantitative hedge fund that only catered to institutional investors to an investment firm that provided mutual funds and private funds for retail investors. AQR Capital Management underwent a challenging period between 2018 and 2020 as it underperformed the broader market and reported poor returns. However, the investment firm staged a comeback in 2021 at a time when the S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a yearly decline of 20%. Numerous funds at AQR Capital reported record performance. The long-running Absolute Return strategy yielded a return of 55% before fees. AQR Capital Management has assets under management (AUM) of roughly $100 billion as of Q1 2023. Some of the popular stocks in Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).AQR CAPITAL MANAGEMENTCliff Asness of AQR Capital ManagementOur MethodologyWe picked the top 10 blue chip value stocks with a P/E ratio of less than 15 from the Q1 2023 portfolio of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. These stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund’s stake in them. Furthermore, we have included the number of hedge fund holders for each stock as of Q1 2023.10. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)Trailing P/E Ratio: 5.74xCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Holdings: $153,226,909Percentage of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Portfolio: 0.33%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is a Pennsylvania, United States-based building company. AQR Capital Management initiated a position in the stock in Q1 2011, with around 67000 shares. Presently, the hedge fund owns over 2.5 million shares in the company.On May 23, an analyst at Credit Suisse increased the price target on Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)  from $63 to $73 and maintained an Outperform rating on the stock after the company posted strong Q2 2023 results. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.27% as of May 23.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share. Historically, Toll Brothers’ shares have been valued, on average, at 1.4 times book value and a peak multiple of approximately 2.0 times tangible book value. If the shares recover in the next few years and trade only to the company’s long-term average multiple of 1.4 times book value, Toll Brothers’ share price would increase 82% to $91 per share.”9. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Trailing P/E Ratio: 7.36xCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Holdings: $188,597,085Percentage of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Portfolio: 0.41%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59On April 26, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was given a target price of $45 along with an Outperform rating at TD Cowen. Analysts at the investment firm highlighted that the positive perception of the brand aided the company in raising prices. This could play an integral role in helping Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) achieve its financial targets and meet guidance for the year. In Q1 2023, the company reported an increase in subscribers by 633,000. Furthermore, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) anticipates a year-over-year (YoY) wireless service top-line expansion of 2.5% to 4.5% for the rest of 2023. Meanwhile, the company forecasts adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.85. The midpoint of $4.70 is in line with the consensus forecast.8. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Trailing P/E Ratio: 5.02xCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Holdings: $195,983,416Percentage of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Portfolio: 0.43% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has revealed that it will launch an all-electric edition of its luxury full-size Cadillac Escalade SUV later this year. The announcement was made by the Detroit, Michigan-based auto manufacturer on May 22. The launch is aligned with General Motors Company’s (NYSE:GM) vision of becoming an all-electric vehicle manufacturer by the end of this decade. The company is leveraging its Ultium platform for its current and upcoming electric vehicles. The present fuel-powered Escalade is priced at $80,000 currently. However, the all-electric Hummer EV has been priced at $110,000, and this reflects that the all-electric Cadillac Escalade could be priced even higher.7. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Trailing P/E Ratio: 10.57xCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Holdings: $209,881,024Percentage of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Portfolio: 0.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 513M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a Saint Paul, Minnesota-based industrial conglomerate. The company is working on simplifying its supply chain and increasing its focus on high-growth industries like electric vehicles, home improvement, and semiconductors. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is also streamlining its operations to control costs. The company has announced that it will reduce its headcount by 6,000 employees globally. This round of layoff is on top of the 2,500 job cuts announced at the start of the year. These job cuts would reflect a decline in global headcount by 10%. These changes are expected to result in savings of $700 million to $900 million and improve the company’s margins. During Q1 2023, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported an EPS of $1.97, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.58. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) offers an attractive annual forward dividend yield of 5.90% as of May 23.6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Trailing P/E Ratio: 8.47xCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Holdings: $236,987,068Percentage of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Portfolio: 0.52% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a California, United States-based oil and gas multinational company. The company announced on May 22 that it intends to acquire PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE) in an all-stock deal for $6.6 billion or $72 per share. Some experts think this deal could face challenges from antitrust regulators in getting approvals. Tim Rezvan at KeyBanc sees the move as a surprise as PDC Energy decided to sell its business at an 11% premium only. If the deal is approved, the number of operators in the DJ Basin will fall from four to three.Berkshire Hathaway was the leading hedge fund investor in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) during Q1 2023.Here’s what Madison Funds said about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) as a relative yield example in the Energy sector. CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)In addition to Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), some of the notable stocks in Cliff Asness’ 2023 portfolio include Apple Inc.

175,d71c126a-b44b-3fa4-a63d-84307df6a306,GM,2023-05-25,How Much Upside is Left in General Motors Company (GM)? Wall Street Analysts Think 46.98%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-general-motors-135514889.html,1684936514,STORY,['GM'],"[Shares of General Motors Company (GM) have gained 1.6% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $33.42, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $49.12 indicates a potential upside of 47%.The average comprises 17 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $30 to a high of $86, with a standard deviation of $15.64. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 10.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 157.3% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in GM. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for GMHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in GMThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.8%, as seven estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, GM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much GM could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned +12.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has gained 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $3.70 per share, indicating a change of +158.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.03 points to a change of +258.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.27 indicates a change of +13.8% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, United is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $13.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15.1%. The $53.03 billion and $56.02 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and +5.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $11.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.1%. EPS of -$0.63 for the same period compares with -$4.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was +13.7%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

185,1698f10b-6b1f-3f97-841b-86d8374cfaf6,TGT,2023-05-25,Target on the defensive after removing LGBTQ+-themed products,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-leader-catering-lgbtq-shoppers-192739834.html,1684956459,STORY,['TGT'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Target once distinguished itself as being boldly supportive of the LGBTQ+ community.Now that status is tarnished after it removed some products aimed at LGBTQ+ and relocated Pride Month displays to the back of stores in certain Southern locations in response to online complaints and in-store confrontations that it says threatened employees’ well-being.Target faces a second backlash from customers upset by the discount retailer’s reaction to aggressive, anti-LGBTQ+ activism, which has also been sweeping through Republican state legislatures. Civil rights groups chided the company on Wednesday for caving to anti-LGBTQ+ customers who tipped over displays and expressed outrage over gender-fluid bathing suits.“Target should put the products back on the shelves and ensure their Pride displays are visible on the floors, not pushed into the proverbial closet,” Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said in a statement. “That’s what the bullies want.”The uproar over Target’s Pride Month marketing — and its response to critics — is just the latest example of how companies are struggling to cater to different groups of customers at a time of extreme cultural divides, particularly around transgender rights.Bud Light is still dealing with the fallout from when it sent transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney a beer can with her face on it, which Mulvaney then displayed in an Instagram post, igniting backlash. Bud Light's parent company is tripling its U.S. marketing spending this summer as it tries to restore lost sales.In Florida, Disney has been engaged in a legal battle with Gov. Ron DeSantis since expressing opposition to the state's classroom limits on discussing gender identity and sexual orientation.Allen Adamson, the co-founder and managing partner of the marketing firm Metaforce, said Target should have thought through the potential for backlash and taken steps to avoid it, like varying the products it sells by region.Story continues“The country is far less homogenous than it ever was,"" he said. “For any brand, it’s not ‘one size fits all’ anymore.”Shares of Target, which is based in Minneapolis, extended their fall on Thursday, declining 2.6% in morning trading. On Wednesday, the stock closed down 3%.According to a 2021 Gallup poll, 21% of people in Generation Z identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, compared with 3% of Baby Boomers. Gallup has also found that younger consumers are most likely to want brands to promote diversity and take a stand on social issues.“Pulling back is the worst thing that they could have done,"" said Jake Bjorseth, who runs trndsttrs, an agency helping brands understand and reach Gen Z customers. “Not to expect potential backlash is to not understand what (LGBTQ+) members go through on a daily basis.”“Once they fold to the more extreme edges of the issue, then they’ve lost their footing,” Adamson added. “If you can change a big brand just by knocking over a display, then they are on the defense, and you never win on the defense.”Target has long been seen as a trailblazer among retailers in the way it embraced LGBTQ+ rights and customers. It was among the first to showcase themed merchandise to honor Pride Month, which takes place in June, and it has been out front in developing relationships with LGBTQ+ suppliers.It has also faced backlash. In 2016, when a national debate exploded over transgender rights, the company declared that “inclusivity is a core belief at Target” and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room “corresponds with their gender identity.”But even after being threatened with boycotts by some customers, Target announced months later that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.As recently as last year, law enforcement agencies were brought in to monitor a social media threat from a young Arizona man who said he was “leading the war” against Target for its Pride Month merchandise, and he encouraged others to take action.But the company is operating in an even more politicized environment now.There are close to 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills that have gone before state legislatures since the start of this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. At least 17 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors, though judges have temporarily blocked their enforcement in some states.Target declined on Thursday to say which items it was pulling from its stores. But ""tuck friendly” women’s swimsuits, which allow trans women who have not had gender-affirming operations to conceal their private parts, were among Target’s Pride items that garnered the most attention. Target removed online this week designs by Abprallen, a London-based company that sells some occult- and satanic-themed LGBTQ+ clothing and accessories outside of Target.Abprallen couldn't immediately be reached for comment but its website on Thursday said it was temporarily closed, with a message that read: “Thank you all for your unrelenting support and love. The positivity and beautiful vibes you’ve sent my way this past week has been overwhelming.”The controversy at Target has been exacerbated by several misleading videos circulating online. In some, people falsely claimed the retailer was selling “tuck-friendly” bathing suits for kids.”Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior,” Target said in a statement Tuesday.The company pledged its continued support for the LGBTQ+ community and noted it is “standing with them as we celebrate Pride Month and throughout the year.”Indeed, it was business as usual at many Target locations on Wednesday.At the Target in Topeka, Kansas, the Pride display remained up front, visible as shoppers passed a corral of shopping carts right after the entrance. It included Pride-themed clothing for kids, as well as T-shirts and women’s bathing suits for adults.“I like that our local stores here have it front and center, when you walk in,” said Shay Hibler, a Topeka self-employed small business owner who was shopping with her 13-year-old daughter and supports LGBTQ+ rights.Megan Rusch, a Kansas City-area resident who is studying criminal justice at Washburn University in Topeka, was shopping at the same store and said while other locations might worry about their image, “This is a pretty diverse area.”She said she believes it’s good for the stores to have the Pride displays so that LGBTQ+ customers feel included.Her shopping companion, Blake Ferguson, a Colorado resident who is studying accounting and finance student at Ottawa University, added simply: “Love is love.”___Durbin contributed from Detroit.

Some advocacy groups have criticized Target's response — calling on the retailer to not back down to hate-filled backlash and reaffirm its support with the LGBTQ+ community.Here are some things to know about the controversy surrounding the Target Pride collection and the company's response.DID TARGET PULL ITS PRIDE COLLECTION?Target did not pull its entire Pride collection, but it has removed certain items ahead of Pride month.The chain also made other changes to the selling of its LGBTQ+ merchandise nationwide, with Target confirming that it moved its Pride merchandise from the front of the stores to the back in some Southern locations after confrontations from shoppers in the region.WHY IS TARGET PULLING PRIDE PRODUCTS? AND WHICH ONES?Target said it's pulling certain items from the Pride collection due to intense and threatening backlash from some customers — which has impacted employees' sense of safety, the company said. Target said that customers knocked down Pride displays at some stores, angrily approached workers and posted threatening videos on social media from inside the stores.The retailer added that it would be ""removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.” Target declined to further specify which products would be impacted.Story continues“Tuck friendly” women’s swimsuits, which allow trans women who have not had gender-affirming operations to conceal their private parts, were among Target's Pride items that garnered the most attention. There are bogus claims on social media platforms that the swimsuits were being sold in the children's department. Designs by Abprallen, a London-based company that designs and sells occult- and satanic-themed LGBTQ+ clothing and accessories, have also created backlash.WHAT STARTED THE CONTROVERSY AROUND TARGET'S PRIDE COLLECTION?The controversy gained traction online last week as conservative media attacked Target’s Pride month collection — which has also been the subject of several misleading videos in recent weeks that falsely claimed the retailer is selling “tuck-friendly” bathing suits designed for kids. The backlash also spilled over into physical stores.Target and other retailers have been expanding their LGBTQ+ displays to celebrate Pride month in June for roughly a decade. Today's confrontations in Target stores arrive amid a surge of legislation targeting LGBTQ+ people across the nation.There are close to 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills that have gone before state legislatures since the start of this year, an unprecedented number, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Those efforts focus on health, particularly gender-affirming health care for transgender youth, and education. State legislatures are also pushing to prevent discussions in school regarding sexuality and gender identity.WHAT HAS BEEN TARGET'S RESPONSE?In addition to deciding to remove some of its items amid other adjustments to the selling of its Pride collection, Target said that the company's focus is now “on moving forward with our continuing commitment to the LGBTQIA+ community and standing with them as we celebrate Pride Month and throughout the year.”Some activists and advocacy groups, however, have criticized Target's response — calling on the retailer to reaffirm its support with the LGBTQ+ community.“Target should put the products back on the shelves and ensure their Pride displays are visible on the floors, not pushed into the proverbial closet. That’s what the bullies want. Target must be better,” stated Kelley Robinson, president of The Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ+ civil rights group in the U.S.“Extremist groups and individuals work to divide us and ultimately don’t just want rainbow products to disappear, they want us to disappear,” Robinson added. “For the past decade, the LGBTQ+ community has celebrated Pride with Target — it’s time that Target stands with us and doubles-down on their commitment to us.”]"

RRR will likely benefit from solid Las Vegas operations, strong visitation and development projects. This and the focus on repositioning of land portfolio bodes well. However, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates are a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Driving GrowthRed Rock Resorts’ Las Vegas operations have been a key growth driver in the past few quarters and the trend will likely continue in the upcoming quarters. During the first quarter of 2023, revenues from Las Vegas operations came in at $430 million, up 7.6% year over year. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA came in at $214.1 million compared with $198.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.The company is bullish about its long-term view, owing to favorable supply-demand dynamic, positive long-term trends in population growth and stable regulatory environment. Attributes such as best-in-class assets and locations, unparallel distribution and scale and a solid organic development pipeline are likely to add to the positives.Red Rock Resorts is witnessing favorable customer trends, following the reopening of most of its properties. During the first quarter of 2023, the company witnessed consistent visitation from its guests and strong spend per visit across its portfolio. Attributes such as consistent visitation from guests, increased spending per visit, more time spent on gaming devices and a return of core customers have added to the positives. The company reported growth in food and beverage and hotel segments fueled by the strength in catering business. RRR intends to focus on business optimization and cost-reduction measures to drive growth.Red Rock Resorts continues to focus on development projects to drive growth. During the first quarter, the company stated progress with respect to the Durango development project. During the quarter, the company emphasized on expanding its casino area with additional gaming positions. It is of the opinion that a larger casino footprint will better align the product offering given the backdrop of favorable demographics surrounding the Durango region. With solid progress reported (as of March 2023), the company anticipates opening the project by fourth-quarter 2023. It expects to spend approximately $780 million on the project, thereby covering costs related to design, construction, preopening expenses and financing expenses.The company emphasizes on divestitures to drive growth. On April 20, the Oakland A's entered into a purchase and sale agreement to buy 48.6 acres of land on Viva site. It was provided an option of acquiring additional eight acres of land on the site. Red Rock Resorts stated that upon closing of the transaction (along with the eight-acre option), it will retain 39.3 acres (of Viva site) for future monetization. The company is bullish on the repositioning strategy of land portfolio. It anticipates closing the deal in the fourth quarter of 2023.Story continuesConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, shares of Red Rock Resorts have gained 4.6% compared with the industry’s 16.6% growth. The downside was mainly due to inflationary pressures, increased energy costs and rising interest rates. During the first quarter of 2023, the company witnessed price inflation in ordinary goods and services such as food costs, supplies, energy costs and construction costs. During the quarter, food and beverage expenses increased 12.9% year over year to $60.1 million. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment. For 2023, our model predicts casino expenses and Food and beverage expenses to rise 4.5% and 5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Red Rock Resorts’ carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Also, regular maintenance and repair demand bodes well for the company.However, this wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related products is facing headwinds in the form of high costs and macroeconomic risks.Let us delve deeper into the factorsWhat is Favoring POOL?Pool is focused on expansion to drive revenues. It is foraying into newer geographic locations, expanding in existing markets and launching innovative product categories that will boost its market share. During first-quarter 2022, the company boosted its presence in the DIY segment of the market with the acquisition of Pinch A Penny. Given the synergies coupled with its robust development pipeline, the company expects the initiative to drive growth going ahead. During the first quarter of 2023, Pinch A Penny retail sales increased 10% year over year. During the quarter, POOL opened five new franchise locations.POOL benefits from its market-leading position that offers cost advantage and allows it to generate a higher return on investment than smaller companies. Further, the housing market continues to boost demand for Pool’s products despite numerous competitors and low barriers to entry. The company generates a large portion of its earnings from existing pools.More than half of its gross profits are generated from products related to the maintenance and repair of pools, while the remainder is derived from the construction and installation of pools and landscaping.HeadwindsPOOL has been witnessing increased expenses lately. Notably, inflationary cost increases in areas of facilities, freight, insurance, IT, advertising and marketing are leading to higher expenses. During the first quarter, selling and administrative expenses increased 5.9% year over year to $224 million. For 2023, the company anticipates inflationary pressure in the range of 4-5%.POOL’s business is susceptible to weather changes. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s operations were affected by unfavorable weather conditions in California, Arizona and Canada, which have about 50% of the company’s branches and sales operations, including Texas. So far this year, the company reported the impact of weather challenges on revenues (in the Western U.S.) of $60-$70 million.The company conducts business internationally, which increases its dependence on other economies. Thus, unfavorable political and regulatory conditions in the market where it functions, as well as negative currency translation, might dent the company’s international sales. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s European operations were negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures, spiraling energy costs and the war in Ukraine. During the quarter, net sales from European markets were down 25% year over year. Given the headwinds, the company expects European operations to be under pressure for some time.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of POOL have declined 14% in the past year against the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Products industry’s growth of 1.2%.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPOOL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&amp;A. Sir, the floor is yours.Michael C. LucarelliThank you, Liz, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our Second Quarter Fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial statements and schedules at investor.analog.com on to the disclosure. Information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. As results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. And these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Chair Vince.Story continuesVincent T. RocheThanks, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, I'm very pleased to share that ADI continue to execute well in the second quarter. We delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and record earnings per share. Notably, revenue was $3.26 billion, growing 10% year-over-year. And once again, this was driven by record results in our industrial and automotive sectors. Gross margin was nearly 74%, and operating margin surpassed 51% and reflecting the innovation premium, our portfolio commands and our strong financial discipline and EPS increased an impressive 18% year-over-year. Now I'd like to spend a moment on the current business conditions. We previously shared that our business was at an inflection point due to uncertain economic and geopolitical backdrop. After 3 years of steady growth, customers are beginning to adjust their forecasts and rebalance their inventories. This is most pronounced in Asia, while North America and Europe demand is moderating but at a more measured pace. We expect this normalization of revenue will persist through the second half of 2023. Importantly, given our customer conversations and proactive decisions to improve lead times and rightsize our backlog, we're in a position to deliver on our goal of delivering a soft lending. Stepping back, we've successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before. Today, ADI has an even more durable franchise defined by an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications a hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations and, of course, a fortified balance sheet.These characteristics instill a resiliency that helps ADI mitigate market weakness and invest through our economic cycles in critical areas that will define our future. Notably, unlike previous economic cycles, we have numerous concurrent secular growth drivers across all of our markets that drive more semi content per dollar of CapEx. And we have exposure to sectors that will transcend the macro uncertainty, including areas like digital health care, aerospace, defense and the electrification ecosystem. So to that end, I want to highlight our digital health care business, which resides in our industrial end market. Health care is a market that is ripe for innovation and is one that requires the highest levels of performance. Now currently, the United States leads the world in health care spending with more than $4 trillion spent in 2022 alone. Approaching 20% of GDP. This amount has steadily increased over several decades and unfortunately, does not correlate to world-leading health outcomes. Both the U.S., along with most international health care systems are still reliant on serving the majority of patients with critical or chronic conditions in large centralized acute care hospitals, where specialized expertise and equipment reside. The pandemic highlighted the fragility of this system, underscoring the urgent need for remote physician consultation and distributed clinical-grade patient care. This vision of a decentralized system to improve the accessibility, affordability and efficacy of global health care can only be realized through the proliferation of edge-based diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. ADI saw this promising opportunity early and made digital health care a strategic focus area over a decade ago. Over that time, our R&amp;D investments have expanded our portfolio from core signal processing, sensing and power technologies to more highly integrated application-specific products to now full system-level solutions. The results, our health care franchise has delivered 7 straight record revenue years, generating $900 million annually and we're on track to achieve a new high watermark in '23 despite the macro backdrop. Importantly, ADI has become an industry leader in 3 primary areas. The first is medical imaging, where our highly integrated products perform critical functions. This includes enhancing image quality, minimizing radiation dosage, improving system assembly and simplifying field maintenance. Today, we have strong share positions in areas like CT scanners, digital x-ray and ultrasound. Next is automation and instrumentation. For example, our broad portfolio enables us to create the optimized signal chains required in applications such as infusion pumps, ventilators and defibrillators. Third is personal health monitoring. Here, our highest performance products are used throughout the operating room and the ICU, while more compact versions with lower power are designed into wearable devices, performing both clinical and consumer wellness monitoring functions. Now let me share some of the examples of how we're seeing ADI solutions shape the future of health care. The ultrasound industry is migrating from large cart-based equipment to more compact mobile systems. Recently, ADI won the design as a market leader for their compact ultrasound system. Our solution leverages our complete portfolio, including high-speed signal chain and high-voltage power technologies, to deliver the highest quality images at the lowest power in a smaller footprint. We're also developing an echo to beat technology to untether the ultrasound modality from the hospital and enable hospital grade care and even the most remote locations. Our solution uses proprietary ultra-low power analog technology that performs both the data acquisition and beam forming functions at extremely low power levels with embedded software algorithms. This allows the user to get cart-based performance in a handheld form without compromising image quality, resolution or functionality. Now turning for a moment to robotic surgery. Currently, only about 15% of the world's surgical procedures use robotic technology despite the many benefits. These include greater precision, flexibility and control during surgery, and shorter hospital stays, fewer complications and lower levels of pain for patients. We're already designed in at the largest robotic surgical suppliers with our suite of precision motor control, signal processing, power management and sensing solutions. And with content per system in the thousands of dollars and performance demands increasing exponentially, this application is poised to deliver significant growth in the years ahead. In the area of personal health monitoring, clinical grade vital signs monitors are converging with consumer wellness wearables. Now this is an emerging market for our comprehensive suite of technologies. Including our sensor AFEs, microcontrollers and ultra low-power technologies, which has been strengthened by the integration of Maxim. For example, in diabetes management, ADI has long been a leading supplier of blood glucose monitoring technology. Now we're working with key customers in the next generation of continuous glucose monitoring. Our solution increases the level of robustness accuracy and power efficiency of the glucose sensor, thereby extending its life from days to weeks. And there is much, much more to come. We're extending our reach into innovative medical products that connect our hardware with cloud-based connectivity, analytics and service. I'm delighted to share with you that our first noninvasive chronic disease management device is undergoing marketing clearance with the FDA, and I look forward to sharing more as this new market has the potential to significantly expand our health care set. So big picture, we're shaping the digital revolution in health care. ADI's ability to go from component to system supplier underscores our deep domain expertise and unrelenting focus on innovation, setting us apart from the pack, not only in health care but in all of our markets. So while there's near-term uncertainty, we're excited about the long-term opportunities that lie ahead. The center of gravity for data processing is shifting from the cloud to the edge. And ADI where data is born, is at the center of this evolution, enabling the next waves of innovation for our customers. Now before I hand over to Prashanth, I want to address our announcement that he will be leaving ADI at the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize Prashanth for his many contributions and for his partnership over these past 6 years. He's played an important role during a period of extraordinary growth and value creation for ADI, including help build a robust finance function and fostering strong investor community engagement. Please know that Prashanth will be remaining in its full capacity and continuing to engage with all of you while we identify our next CFO through a search process that is now underway. And with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahThank you, Vince. It has been an honor to serve as the CFO of this phenomenal company and lead this world-class finance organization. As Vince mentioned, I'm fully committed to ensuring a smooth transition, and I look forward to engaging with all of you during the coming quarters. I do want to express my deep appreciation to Vince, both as a coach and a mentor but also for introducing me to this magical world of semiconductors. As my boss often says, we truly are the bedrock upon which the global technology industry is built. Now turning to our second quarter results. As usual, my comments today, with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We delivered another very strong quarter, record revenue of $3.26 billion exceeded the midpoint of guidance and represented ADI's 13th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, we grew 10%, led once again by all-time highs in industrial and automotive. Breaking it down by market, industrial, our most diverse and profitable business represented 53% of revenue and finished up 3% sequentially. Year-over-year growth of 16% was broad-based, notable gains in sustainable energy, aerospace and defense. These markets, in addition to health care, which Vince just highlighted, are much better positioned to withstand cyclical slowdown. And together, they represent roughly 40% of industrial revenue. Automotive, which represented 24% of revenue, once again exhibited broad-based strength, growing 10% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Secular tailwinds fueling content growth continue to drive ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which combined, increased nearly 40% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 14% of revenue decreased both sequentially and year-over-year due to the ongoing inventory corrections across this end market. And lastly, consumer at 9% of revenue was down more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year. After several quarters of softness, consumer revenue is close to its COVID load, suggesting that the correction is nearly complete. Moving on to the P&amp;L. Gross margin of 73.7% was up slightly sequentially due to favorable product mix, OpEx at $733 million was in line with last quarter and op margins of 51.2%, up roughly 100 basis points year-over-year, set a new record. Non-op expenses were $48 million and our tax rate was 11.4%. Remember that Q2 is typically our lowest rate. All told, EPS came in at $2.83, up an impressive 18% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. We've discussed many times our decision to hold more finished goods inventory versus restocking the channel. Thus, our days of inventory increased to 168 and channel inventory weeks were basically unchanged. As we outlined a quarter ago, we expect inventory dollars will decline in the second half as we balance the replenishment of die bank and moderate external purchases. Moving to cash flow. CapEx was $284 million in the quarter and $930 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 7% of revenue. As a reminder, we outlined at our Investor Day that we expect CapEx to be high single digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then decline in subsequent years to our longer-term target of mid-single digits. These investments will support our long-term growth plans and enable strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies enhances our resiliency. It offers our customers additional optionality, and it provides an important financial shock absorber during times of volatility. Of note, our CapEx spend to date does not include the benefits of both the U.S. and the European tax credit and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and European chip SoC. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $4 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. We've returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, $3.5 billion in buybacks and $1.6 billion via dividend. We remain committed to our shareholder-friendly policy of returning 100% of free cash flow over the long term. Now before moving to the outlook, I do want to provide some additional details on the evolving business conditions. As Vince shared in his remarks, customers are adjusting forecast and rebalancing inventory. At the same time, our lead times continue to improve, with over 70% of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. This gives customers high confidence into the timeliness of our supply. The result book-to-bill, as we outlined last quarter, remains below parity in all markets and our backlog due in the current quarter has returned to its typical coverage range. As a result, total backlog continues to decline, but at just under a year of revenue, it's still 2x regular levels. And lastly, after a strong start to the second quarter, demand quickly deteriorated in Asia, impacting channel sell-through. As a result, we plan to reduce channel inventory in this region. And in the third quarter, we are planning for sell-in to be below sell-through for the total company. Given these dynamics, we are guiding third quarter revenue to be $3.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect industrial and auto to be down low to mid-single digits sequentially, communications down around 10% sequentially, while consumer will increase sequentially. Op margin is expected to be 48.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. The decline in op margin relates to our annual merit increases, changing product mix and a reduction of manufacturing utilization given the softer environment. Our tax rate, again, between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.52, plus or minus $0.10. While the near-term operating environment is a difficult one, our diversification and exposure to key secular trends is expected to help mitigate the revenue impact. In addition, we have key levers to help us minimize margin volatility. This includes our flexible hybrid manufacturing model which allows us to quickly reduce spend on external wafers and moderate the impact on internal utilizations. Our variable compensation program, which has a true accordion-like function, allowing us to reduce spend while still investing in key long-term areas. As a result, we expect a durable earnings stream and solid free cash flow generation. Enabling us to take advantage of any share price dislocations. Before handing off to Mike, I want to remind folks that in June, we will be doing a deep dive on the burgeoning opportunity for ADI in the construction of Gigafactories. And with that, let me pass it to Mike for Q&amp;A.Michael C. LucarelliThanks, Prashanth. I want to echo Vince's comments to thank you for the partnership over the past 6 years, but I will warn you is not done yet. We have called more earnings calls together. So with that, let's get to the Q&amp;A session. (Operator Instructions) With that, we have our first question, please.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.Vivek AryaJust to Prashanth. So my question really is, I'm trying to understand where is the incremental weakness? Is it limited to Asia. And within Asia, is that industrial or automotive or both? And what about non-Asia demand? How has that changed versus what you thought 3 months ago?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahYes. Thank you, Vivek. It's been a pleasure to work with you, and we still have a few quarters together. Everyone is focused on the quarter-over-quarter. But before, I guess, to your answer, I do want to take a step back and look at the year-over-year because I do think that tells the story of share gains and the increasing content per dollar of CapEx which is what we believe delivers that long-term shareholder value. If you look at our industrial and auto business, they are up year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. Industrial, I'll call it, roughly mid-single digits and auto mid-teens year-over-year. And this comes at a time when PMIs are below 50 and auto SAAR is relatively modest. So while the economics in the cycle dictate the number of units our customers sell, which will impact our business, our share gains and our increasing content per dollar of CapEx is what we expect to help us outperform, which means we're going to decline less in bad times and accelerate in good times. To your specific question, China definitely was the sort of the piece of new information that has developed over the more recent period. We are -- we've had 3 quarters of decline in China, and we're expecting a fourth. We did see an uptick following kind of the resumption or the return to office after Chinese New Year, but that did fade quickly. And the result was we've got inventory a little higher in the channel there than we expected. Very confident that this is not a share issue. This is a reflection of what's going on in those markets, and it's broad-based across both industrial and auto. Outside of China, I'd say that industrial and auto is holding up relatively well, especially North America, Europe and Japan. Not as strong as it was prior quarter, but it's not falling rapidly. And I would characterize it more as a measured slowdown. Comms and consumer, we've been talking about those in all those geographies, those remain weak.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.Tore Egil SvanbergPrashanth, it's been great working with you. Wish you all the best. I know we're together for a fewer months, but anyway, we wish you all the best. My question is on utilization and inventory levels. So could you give us a sense of where utilization is today? What's your plan for the second half? You did talk about inventory in dollar terms coming down in the second half. But if you could give us any color on the extent of that, I would really appreciate it.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahYes. Thank you, Tore. It's great working with you. So as we think about inventory, inventory is going to remain higher than normal because we're keeping the channel lean. This is something we started 2 or 3 quarters ago. From a dollar basis, inventory has peaked in second quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and you should see dollars start to trend down from here given the actions that we're taking, which is both reducing our external wafer bills, which is an opportunity that we have because of our swing capacity in our hybrid manufacturing model. And that also allows us to balance out the die bank building in our internal factories with softer demand and tap the brakes on in utilization. Utilization, I would say, still are at elevated levels, so we expect them to start getting closer to what we would consider normal levels in the -- in our fiscal fourth quarter.Michael C. LucarelliSo to give you a little context, in the outlook we gave -- we talked about 48.5% operating margin. That assumes gross margins come down from where they are today. That's mix and also it is utilization, as Prashanth mentioned. And then OpEx was up a little bit in the third quarter based on merit increase, offset some by the variable compensation. So that's how kind of the math around that. And then as you say, as you look out, utilities probably don't go higher from -- in 4Q after 3Q. Just to kind of give you a feel for the back half of the year. Thanks for the question, we'll have the next one.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.Vincent T. RocheHi Ambrish, we hear you.Ambrish SrivastavaSorry, Sorry, I lost the first step. Thank you, Prashanth. Pleasure working with you as well. I just wanted to come back to the backlog. And you just went through this comment a little bit too quick for me. So the backlog, as you said, 2x regular levels, but book-to-bill below and it is where the typical coverage range is at this point. So I was unsure what that means. More importantly, book-to-bill should then be trending lower as we go over the next couple of quarters. Is that the right conclusion I should take away from those comments?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahWhat I would -- I guess, let me -- let's do this in 2 pieces. First, let's talk about our view on this correction. Obviously, no correction is the same. But if you look over at history, Ambrish, most of these sort of downturns last forward somewhere between 2 to 4 quarters and it's our view that we're going to have a weakness for the second half. But a couple of points around that. First, we are really seeing this as a rolling correction across the market because obviously, no market is fully immune, but I do think that we're better positioned. Comms and consumer, I think we -- you would agree with us, the worst is largely behind us. We -- we've seen those correct over the last couple of quarters, and we're actually being a little bit more optimistic about consumer as we go forward. Industrial and auto, we're starting to see some softness but that's probably not going to just last a quarter. It's important to point out that we do have some areas of strength in industrial. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks. And auto really is going to continue to be a function of the SAAR activity. From a bookings and backlog standpoint, the takeaways you want is bookings overall continue to decrease, but they're basically sitting at about a year of revenue, the total backlog. What that means is that the backlog for the current quarter is now to normal levels, which means that we're back to a point where we will be relying on some book and ship to hit the guide, and that's back to normal pre-COVID levels. And on a book-to-bill, we're below parity, which we had said for a couple of quarters now that this was coming, and that's pretty broad-based. It's sort of all markets, industrial and auto are a little bit better, but all markets, all geographies. I did call out on -- in I think Tore's question that China is certainly the weakest of that.Ambrish SrivastavaGot it. Thank you, I'll hit you back for another follow-up.Michael C. LucarelliNext question.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreLet me add my congratulations to Prashanth. Can you talk about the backlog being out over a year when 70% of lead times are below 13 weeks. How much -- I know you've been pretty aggressive scrubbing that backlog. How confident are you that, that reflects real demand? And then can you sort of describe -- it seems like you're still getting a pretty decent amount of bookings considering that people have booked out 52 weeks and can get product within 13 weeks. Can you just kind of -- are people still placing orders beyond lead time to try to assure continuity?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahGreat question, Joe. Thank you. So first, yes, you're exactly right. When we talk about backlog being out kind of roughly a year in value, that's phased over several quarters. So we have delivery dates from customers that are in future quarters, which sort of gives us confidence to what the future looks like. And now we're sort of back to that stage that we've always operated in pre-COVID levels where there is a percentage of the current quarter's revenues that comes from turns business. So we're back to that state of abnormal with the lead times down as they've improved with our manufacturing capacity additions. Now there's no incentive for customers to keep giving us orders out with a significant advanced notice. They can get most of what they need pretty quickly. And that's the transition that you're seeing being reflected in the book-to-bill rate. But Again, as I mentioned, we are expecting and Vince has talked for a couple of quarters now that we were expecting the macro impact to hit us, but we remain very confident that content story we have is going to help mute the impact relative to others. And given our end market exposure, as I mentioned, it's sort of going to be rolling through us. Consumer and comms are largely behind us. We will see auto pressure on units for a couple of quarters -- sorry, industrial pressure on units for a couple of quarters. And auto, we can't give you a good sense of, except to say we know we have a phenomenal content story growth there, and it really will depend on consumer purchases.Vincent T. RocheYes. I think, Joe, at the margins, I think our customers have changed the behavior. It used to be that the world expected to be able to operate on a very rapid turn cycle. No, I think that will persist. But what will also persist is the change in behavior around aligning long customers aligning their longer-term demands with supply. And those are conversations that we're having continuously. So I think the behavior has changed somewhat, and perhaps we've got a new normal.Michael C. LucarelliThanks, Joe. Next question.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.Christopher Brett DanelyI'll add my congrats to Prashanth. I wish I was retiring too. I just had, I guess, a question or some more color on the correction. What do you think triggered it? Do you think it was just a function of the shortages going away and people always had a little bit of inventory out there, and now they're going to start to cancel orders? And then how bad do you think it could get? I mean your auto business has tripled in your industrial business has doubled in the last 2 years and change. So what should we be thinking for like the October quarter and beyond?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahYes. Chris, I don't know that I would call it a trigger per se. I think that, as I mentioned, we've been sort of rolling through this. It is just that there's been enough growth in sub parts of our market that have overshadowed the pressure we've seen on comms and consumer. Now industrial, which is really the flagship starting to feel a little bit of the impact from the higher interest rate environment. So that's coming through. But again, I would call out that we've got a pretty sizable portion of that industrial market that is very recession resistance. That's the health care business, which Vince talked about, the aerospace and defense as well as our energy business. I think what I mentioned, I think, to Ambrish's question is the piece that perhaps was most surprising to us is we were expecting a stronger bounce in China as they reopened from COVID and they got on the other side of Chinese New Year, and that recovery has not happened. And again, as I mentioned, we know that it's not a share issue is a macro issue to that market. And what was the second part of your question?Christopher Brett DanelyJust how bad do you think it could get any color on October and beyond?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahI'm going to turn to the 40-year veteran of this business who has seen multiple cycles and let Vince take that.Vincent T. RocheYes. Chris, I think first and foremost, what we're seeing now in our business is that the troughs are not as deep, and the peaks are steeper than they used to be. There's more and more content in every one of the market segments that we participate in. So I think that's the way to look at it. The troughs are probably going to be -- they're probably going to be shallower. Also, we've been very careful at managing our factories and making sure that we don't necessarily build inventory and ship product that perhaps isn't needed. So my sense is we've set ourselves up for a softer lending just given how we've managed through the cycle and trying to match demand of our customers as tightly as we can with the supply system. So I think perhaps just given where PMIs are at, we would see at least a couple of quarters here of muted demand. And my sense is when the sentiment begins to turn, it will turn quickly.Michael C. LucarelliYes, Chris, I'll add to that one. Unit demand for the couple of quarters here. It's good to think like we've grown 13 quarters relative. I think investors and sell-side people forget that you do have down quarter sometimes. And we're kind of going back to, I will call it, a bit more normal. And a more normal 4Q, you kind of -- you see industrial kind of flat to down from 3Q all is about flat. Comms not much activity happening right now in that market and consumers use up a little bit. And if you look at our 1Q a normal 1Q for us, the B2B markets, which is industrial, auto and comms are down kind of low mid-single digits and consumer is down a bit more due to holiday builds. And then you get a 2Q pickup. Now that's not an outlook. That's just kind of what the normal shape was pre-COVID.Vincent T. RocheYes. I can tell you as well, Chris, from conversations with our industrial and automotive customers, their sentiment is quite strong. I met the CEO of one of the largest industrial automation companies very, very recently. And they see tremendous secular growth drivers. There's a rebound in demand from the pandemic stage, where a lot of factory, the CapEx to improve factories, efficiencies and so on was not spent. So that continues. The whole sustainability challenge is on everybody's mind. So there are many reasons to believe that we're going through a short-term period here of reconciliation, normalization of demand and supply.But my sense is things will recover in the industrial market pretty rapidly. And in automotive, it's a case of we're getting more and more share in the areas that count with our connectivity products, the electric vehicle portfolio that we've got. And there's still reasonable demand, I would say, for mid- to high-end automobiles. So we see this as a relatively short-term reset.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.Ross Clark SeymoreJust want to echo the congrats for Prashanth. A quick clarification then a question. The clarification is, when you talk about the second half being a little bit weaker, is that fiscal year or calendar year? And then the true question is on the automotive side of things. You've mentioned a couple of times that it's kind of SAAR dependent, but the bigger trend in automotive over the last few years has been mainly content and you guys have benefited from that as well.I think you're one of the first companies in the semi side to guide that down, albeit minimally on a sequential basis. Has something changed there that you're seeing that others aren't? Is it inventory? Is it demand? Just any more color on that would be helpful.Michael C. LucarelliYes, I'll go the first part, Ross. I gave a little bit of comments around kind of what I thought would be -- our fiscal 4Q and fiscal 1Q outlook based on kind of normalization. So you can kind of take from that and parse that with your question about is it fiscal second half, calendar second half and put it along that, it's both. With that, I'll pass it to be on the auto side.Prashanth Mahendra-RajahI'll take it. All right. Yes. So look, we've grown 10 quarters in a row, and the growth for the last quarter was very broad-based, again, across all applications. As we think about the outlook, we are beginning to see some softening, though the underlying content growth continue and our top line should still prove to be a strong multiple of SAAR. There is some decline that relates to our strong position in China EV. So when you ask about what's different for EI Ross, I think that the share position we have in China EV is probably one of those differentiating factors. And that is going through an adjustment as well. While China EVs are still expected to grow, it's not going to be growing as fast as we had originally thought. And so as this market comes back, it's going to provide the tailwinds we need for our automotive businesses because we have a very high share. Again, take a step back. We remain very confident that this is a business with the strong product portfolio we have, battery management in cabin connectivity with GMSL, it will be an functional safe power. These represent about half of our business. And in a flat sour environment, we are still going to be able to do double-digit growth.Michael C. LucarelliThanks, Ross. And this could go to our last question, please.OperatorThis question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities.William SteinTwo quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. First, I wonder, you've been very optimistic or relatively optimistic about pricing in the past few discussions we've had, essentially highlighting that boundaries are either still raising or certainly not lowering and you're having no problems passing that on? I'd like you to comment if there's any update in that regard? And then the other is just to try to get a linger a moment and get a better understanding for what happened in China because earlier in the quarter, I think you've met with us and some other investors and discussed how business there was recovering. What -- how can you explain how quickly this seems to have changed from improving in China to suddenly getting even worse?Prashanth Mahendra-RajahThanks. I'm going to do the China one first. So Vince can address the pricing. The China one is pretty straightforward. We as most of the industry, we were watching the recovery coming out of the multi-quarter shutdown in China as well as the Chinese New Year activity looking to see business begin to return to normal levels, given that we had, had a couple of down quarters. We saw a pop in activity and order activity in the -- as we came out of Chinese New Year based on that, we made supply available to the channel. That supply did not move as things kind of quickly got softer or didn't move as much, I should say, it didn't move as much. And therefore, that's why we've now said for the current quarter, we're going to ship in less than we sell through to help readjust that level in -- primarily in Asia. And with that, I'll hand off to Vince to take the pricing question.Vincent T. RocheYes. Thanks, Prashanth. Yes. Well, I think that the headline on pricing is that it is very, very resilient, and I expect that to persist. In general, we're getting we're passing more value to our customers. We're giving more value to our customers. And in fact, the core ASP of our product portfolio has been increasing, not including incidentally the inflationary costs that we pass to our customers. So I think one thing we can say for sure about our franchise is our products are very, very sticky. Our products persist for many, many decades, for example, in the industrial sector. And we're in the post Moore's Law Europe, where the economic conditions have changed fundamentally. So I expect the pricing area to be very steady across the industry in general in the years ahead. And we will look for opportunities to pass on inflation, which is going to be persistent in the industry I believe in the coming years.Michael C. LucarelliThanks, Will. I thank everyone for joining us this morning. A couple of -- I let you go on your way. First, we are planning to combine our general ledger ERP systems this quarter. This represents one of our final steps for the Maxim integration. Given our typically fast reporting cycle, we're giving ourselves an extra week to ensure everything runs smoothly. As such, we plan for our earnings call to be held in the third week of August versus the second. Also, I want to flag that during these more uncertain times, and consistent with our commitment for transparency for our owners, we plan being even more available for investors. Vincent, Prashanth will be New York, Boston, the Bay Area and London in the next quarter. Please reach out to the IR team if you be notified when we are in your neighborhood. And with that, a copy of transcript will be available on the website. Thanks again for joining us and your continued interest in Analog Devices. Have a good day.OperatorThis concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $2.40 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this semiconductor maker would post earnings of $2.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of 6.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Analog Devices , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $3.26 billion for the quarter ended April 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Analog Devices shares have added about 14.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8%.What's Next for Analog Devices?While Analog Devices has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Analog Devices: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

201,65ff4846-34b1-390e-a57d-3db3d0745585,V,2023-05-25,Visa's (NYSE:V) earnings growth rate lags the 12% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visas-nyse-v-earnings-growth-110048079.html,1685012448,STORY,['V'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Visa share price has climbed 70% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 7.4% in the last year , including dividends .Although Visa has shed US$23b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. View our latest analysis for Visa In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Visa achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Visa's TSR for the last 5 years was 76%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Visa has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.4% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 12% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

If you want to see more of billionaire Asness’ blue chip value stocks, go to Billionaire Cliff Asness 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Blue Chip Value Stocks.Cliff Asness, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at AQR Capital Management, believes that the three-decade streak of US stock markets outperforming the global equities market could be coming to an end. He highlighted the fact that in the last three decades, the US stock markets have become relatively overvalued compared to their peers from the developed world. This can be gauged by the fact that the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of US stocks was at an all-time high valuation against their European and Asian peers in 2021 and is still hovering around the same levels. These views were expressed by the billionaire in an article published in The Journal of Portfolio Management on April 28.Mr. Asness believes that international equities become an attractive proposition when US equities are in decline. This hypothesis is backed by empirical evidence, as international equities have outperformed US equities in 96% of cases when US equity returns were below 6% and in 100% of cases when returns fell below 4%. This observation could be used towards building an effective investment strategy with the US equity markets expected to report weak returns in the coming years due to economic and political turmoil impacting them. The potential benefits of diversifying beyond US equities have also been reiterated by UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele.Mr. Asness has a rich experience in the equity markets as he played an important role in developing a mathematical model to identify patterns in the stock market during the early 1990s when he was part of the quantitative research team at Goldman Sachs. At the same time, he was completing his PhD in finance at the University of Chicago. By the mid-1990s, a team under the leadership of Mr. Asness started an internal hedge fund at Goldman Sachs that generated a healthy return of 140% for its investors during the first year of its operations. This fund was eventually launched by the diversified financial services firm as the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund, and within a short span of two years, Mr. Asness was leading the quantitative research team and was responsible for managing $7 billion.Story continuesIn 1998, Mr. Asness embarked on a new chapter and started AQR Capital Management as a co-founder alongside David Kabiller, John Liew, and Robert Krail. AQR Capital Management soon became one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. In 2011, the hedge fund made a transition from being a quantitative hedge fund that only catered to institutional investors to an investment firm that provided mutual funds and private funds for retail investors. AQR Capital Management underwent a challenging period between 2018 and 2020 as it underperformed the broader market and reported poor returns. However, the investment firm staged a comeback in 2021 at a time when the S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a yearly decline of 20%. Numerous funds at AQR Capital reported record performance. The long-running Absolute Return strategy yielded a return of 55% before fees. AQR Capital Management has assets under management (AUM) of roughly $100 billion as of Q1 2023. Some of the popular stocks in Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Presently, the hedge fund owns over 2.5 million shares in the company.On May 23, an analyst at Credit Suisse increased the price target on Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)  from $63 to $73 and maintained an Outperform rating on the stock after the company posted strong Q2 2023 results. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.27% as of May 23.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share. Historically, Toll Brothers’ shares have been valued, on average, at 1.4 times book value and a peak multiple of approximately 2.0 times tangible book value. If the shares recover in the next few years and trade only to the company’s long-term average multiple of 1.4 times book value, Toll Brothers’ share price would increase 82% to $91 per share.”9.

The announcement was made by the Detroit, Michigan-based auto manufacturer on May 22. The launch is aligned with General Motors Company’s (NYSE:GM) vision of becoming an all-electric vehicle manufacturer by the end of this decade. The company is leveraging its Ultium platform for its current and upcoming electric vehicles. The present fuel-powered Escalade is priced at $80,000 currently. However, the all-electric Hummer EV has been priced at $110,000, and this reflects that the all-electric Cadillac Escalade could be priced even higher.7. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Trailing P/E Ratio: 10.57xCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Holdings: $209,881,024Percentage of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s Portfolio: 0.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 513M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a Saint Paul, Minnesota-based industrial conglomerate.

The company has announced that it will reduce its headcount by 6,000 employees globally. This round of layoff is on top of the 2,500 job cuts announced at the start of the year. These job cuts would reflect a decline in global headcount by 10%. These changes are expected to result in savings of $700 million to $900 million and improve the company’s margins.

The company announced on May 22 that it intends to acquire PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE) in an all-stock deal for $6.6 billion or $72 per share. Some experts think this deal could face challenges from antitrust regulators in getting approvals. Tim Rezvan at KeyBanc sees the move as a surprise as PDC Energy decided to sell its business at an 11% premium only.

CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)In addition to Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), some of the notable stocks in Cliff Asness’ 2023 portfolio include Apple Inc.

The company is now aiming to drum up support by pitching the metaverse as a haven for job training and education.That's familiar territory already for HTC. Their live headsets have been put to use by surgeons and firefighters, allowing high stakes training in the safety of a virtual world. Here to discuss is Dan O'Brien, HTC Americas President and global head of enterprise. Thanks for being here.DAN O""BRIEN: Thanks for having me.JULIE HYMAN: It's so interesting to me because we talk about the metaverse. We see Mark Zuckerberg legless, moving around a meeting. But we already are seeing in-use applications for this stuff. So talk to me about HTC's-- like where is it being put to work?DAN O""BRIEN: Sure. And I think the metaverse in general has been really grandiose. And everybody thinks it's this new thing that has to happen right away. It is down the road. It is something that actually will evolve into. But right now, there's a lot of real-world applications, professional use cases, whether it's in the public sector health care.We are seeing architecture, engineering, construction, great efficiencies, training and simulation, designing new products. This is across the board. These are real applications being used today. We all have a version of the metaverse, but we have something we call the VIVERSE. But this is for businesses. This is for corporate use. This is for benefiting your company.Down the road, this avatar and all of us interacting with each other, that's things that are going to happen down the road. And there's a bunch of hurdles that we actually have to solve to get there before that can become a reality.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: So I have two questions for you now then. So first, the hurdles, I imagine some of those are legal hurdles, and then-- but actually, before you get to that, you made a comment to us, before we got to live with this, about immersive products like the VR headsets replacing this and being just as--DAN O""BRIEN: ubiquitous.DIANE KING HALL: --in daily-- yes, as ubiquitous, that's the word I was looking for, as the smartphone. How can you say that?DAN O""BRIEN: Well, I mean, we made a huge leap this past year in building what we call the XR elite, which is something that's on the realm of just glasses. These products, we will introduce radios into them just like it does in your smartphone. We have a long history of making smartphones and what we call radiated endpoints or terminal points, which is a smartphone.These products will become connected. That needs a Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T wireless, a T-Mobile, a Vodafone. You will see 5G networks and eventually 6G networks in 2030, where you will actually have connected wearables.And then you'll see headsets that actually have multifunctionality of mixed reality, where we can see the real world as well as digital overlays and digital introductions. And then things become much more ubiquitous and easy to use. But you actually have to deliver content to all of these wearables wherever you are. That's a huge hurdle to solve.JULIE HYMAN: So part of that is the technology that in getting to that 6G, or what have you. What about the human element? Because we've seen some of these products come out before. What was it, the Google specs? Snap had the spectacles, I believe they were called. And like people--DIANE KING HALL: They were just trendy.JULIE HYMAN: --well, people got made fun of, there was that-- like there's that aspect of cultural adoption that sometimes can be a big hurdle--DAN O""BRIEN: That's right.JULIE HYMAN: --to solve.DAN O""BRIEN: So that's why we start with-- our company actually stands for innovation, technology, and humanity. So all the solutions that we've been focused on since 2015, 2016 has been solutions that actually bring value, whether it's cost savings into your corporate environment, efficiencies of collaboration, and designing new products, or training nurses, doctors. We work we fund, actual developers that create solutions to training surgeons.JULIE HYMAN: So in other words, down the road, it has to be worth it for me that's on a consumer level to wear these things? It has to bring me something that my phone--DAN O""BRIEN: And on the consumer level, you really don't see anything outside of gaming right now, which--JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I was going to ask that. But what is the use case besides just--DAN O""BRIEN: Gaming and entertainment?JULIE HYMAN: Yes. Exactly.DAN O""BRIEN: So what some companies can fall into that or thinking, I guess, with an infinite mindset is if they're just thinking about the short-term play and just trying to get a number of users to just play a game or play something like that, they're really not playing the long game. The long game is actually bringing the headsets and the technology into lighter, more wearable, easier ergonomics connected to a network. And then actually changing out the use cases.Once you can we start interacting with phone calls, once you can start interacting with content that's actually valuable to you from a consumer level, you'll see that broader adoption. But right now, we're still in early adopters and enterprise use cases.DIANE KING HALL: And what's the expectation for what the market value will bear out in terms of the overall market value globally? Because, for instance, this week China announced a stake back metaverse platform. What's the expectation for, say, within the next five years?DAN O""BRIEN: Sure, I mean, I'm thinking looking at like cities evaluation, they expected it to be a $13 trillion economy in business. And I think that shows one significant opportunity to actually grow into the different use cases. But I do think that overall, we will see a very, very aggressive growth.Over the next two, years we'll see really great adoption across financial services, banking with the use of this technology inside of their corporate environments, whether it's training, simulation, hard skills training, soft skills training, collaboration. And then, I think, what you'll see is very similar to smartphones. Now, that was-- how we brought that into our lives and then how we brought that into our consumer lives. You're going to see a very similar trend with immersive technology and products.JULIE HYMAN: Just really quickly. There's immersive technology, there's ARVR, and then there's the metaverse. And I think the fact that we still don't really understand what the heck the metaverse is is part of the issue here. What is the difference? How should we even think about it? Is the metaverse really a thing or is it just immersive technology?DAN O""BRIEN: One, it's-- today, the metaverse is the internet. It's what we interact with from a digital standpoint. Without going too far into what the future scape of trying to understand it is. Today, the metaverse is an intranet use case inside of a corporate environment where you can use it for these 20 training simulations.Now, that will then be able to be connected to your regular internet. And then you'll be able to actually have brands and things of that nature, get involved into consumer products and consumer--JULIE HYMAN: So it Becomes the metaverse when it's bigger basically?DAN O""BRIEN: And right now, it's small pockets of interactive experiences. And today-- and today, we do that with automotive, aerospace, health care. In these specific segments we bring strong value and efficiency into these companies. And then we look at this broader thing down the road. But we will actually see the inclusion of the Verizon Wireless of the world and the AT&amp;Ts wireless of the world to actually then bring that fruition to the forefront.DIANE KING HALL: Well, next time, I guess, maybe we do this interview in the metaverse with our avatars. [LAUGHS] I know. I'm a skeptic too. That was just-- again, I don't see this replace that fast. But we'll see. We'll see.DAN O""BRIEN: It's going to happen.DIANE KING HALL: OK. All right. All right. You heard it here first. Thanks to Dan O'Brien, HTC America's president and global head of enterprise--]"
209,10c6ff03-f301-3e32-b980-486840a18e83,VZ,2023-05-25,Here's What's Concerning About Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-concerning-verizon-communications-130102516.html,1684933262,STORY,['VZ'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.094 = US$31b ÷ (US$378b - US$48b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.4%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 6.8% generated by the Telecom industry, it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Verizon Communications compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Verizon Communications' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 9.4%. However it looks like Verizon Communications might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Verizon Communications  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(VZ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-trending-130012062.html,1684933212,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -2.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has lost 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 points to a change of -9.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 indicates a change of +0.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.8%. The $135.08 billion and $136.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +1.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recognized repeatedly for reliability, Verizon’s extreme network is designed to withstand extreme weather and deliver superior service by including redundancy on critical paths and components to avoid potential failures which could significantly affect customers. The use of battery and generator backup systems in critical locations such as cell sites and network operations centers also serve to minimize the risk of disruption if commercial power is lost. One hundred percent of Verizon macro cell sites which provide large area coverage have backup battery power and 79% have backup generators.But even the most hardened infrastructure can be shaken by mother nature.In case emergency network recovery becomes necessary after a hurricane makes landfall, Verizon is prepared to respond quickly. Verizon maintains a fleet of over 550 portable assets, including fully functional, generator-powered cell sites that can replace or enhance network coverage and capacity in a given area as well as drones and a fixed wing aircraft that can provide service and situational awareness from the sky above. Additionally, Verizon boasts an industry-leading 200 satellite-based portable network assets.* These satellite assets provide an alternate way to connect cell sites to the rest of the network in the event that a fiber cable is lost due commercial power outages or physical damage. All of these mobile assets are complemented by more than a thousand portable generators and a comprehensive refueling program. These assets are kept in staging areas across the country for rapid deployment, some even being stored in a cave 60’ below ground for safe-keeping.Story continues“Our network is built with industry leading resiliency and reliability. The work we do before the extreme weather moves in is critical in minimizing its impact and speeding the recovery work after the weather has passed,” said Joe Russo, Verizon’s EVP and President, Global Networks and Technology. “We have invested heavily and trained relentlessly to be ready for rapid-recovery scenarios because we know how critical communications services are.”Prioritizing first responders and mission-critical workAs first responders prepare for hurricane season, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team stands ready to help ensure public safety agencies on the front lines of any potential disaster response operations have the mission-critical communications capabilities they will need to achieve their missions. This team, composed primarily of former first responders and military personnel, is solely dedicated to supporting public safety customers during emergencies at no cost. Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team members set up portable cell sites, WiFi hotspots, free charging stations and other Verizon Frontline devices and solutions that help enable mission-critical communication and/or boost network performance. They deployed in support of nearly 750 public safety agencies in nearly every state in 2022.Verizon engineers prioritize recovery efforts after a storm. The first priority is to restore basic voice communication services for search and rescue and mission-critical life saving work. They then prioritize restoration of service for public safety and Emergency Operations Centers that are activated to respond to an emergency, often working with the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team to deploy mobile cell sites to provide connectivity in temporary forward command centers. Next, engineers focus on support for utility and community response teams who are restoring commercial power, setting up shelters or providing security escort services. When all emergency response teams have service, engineers quickly get work restoring service throughout the impacted area and remain with the impacted community until full service is at pre-storm levels, often modernizing replacement equipment in the process.Verizon’s fleetVerizon’s fleet includes large assets to support mobile workstations and facilities for first responders and the community, a variety of temporary mobile cell sites with standalone power and backhaul connections, and a robust roundup of mobile assets to restore parts of the permanent network infrastructure that could be damaged by storms.Large assets to support mobile workstations and facilities for first responders and the communityTactical/Mobile Command Trailer Command/ Communications for public safety sectorInternational 4300 Truck  Communications and transport for Hazmat response equipmentGooseneck Trailer Work stations and attached shelter for community and public safety support with a satellite-based wifi system.Big Red  Community outreach big rig vehicle with 24 internet-connected workstationsWireless Emergency Command Center (WECC) A mobile communication center with workstations and charging stations open to the public.Store on Wheels (SOW) A fully stocked mobile store supplying devices, equipment and technical supportTactical/Mobile Command Trailer Command/ Communications mobile center for public safety teamsMobile Connectivity Agile Vehicle Remote satellite vehicle able to create eFemto &amp; WiFi networksRapid Response Connectivity Unit Remote vehicle able to provide portable satellite, eFemto, and cradlepoint connections.Wireless Routers Router capable of repeating RF signal and creating ad hoc wifi networks for Emergency Operation Centers and forward command units.Temporary mobile cell sites with standalone power and backhaul connections Satellite Pico-cell on Trailer (SPOT) Mobile connectivity trailer (MCT) satellite trailer solution that can deploy eFemtos and/or WiFi to EOCs and first responders.Satellite Cell on Light Truck (SAT-COLT) Mobile cell site equipment with onboard masts that also includes satellite equipmentCell on Light Truck (COLT) Mobile cell site equipment with onboard masts contained on a truck.Business Inclusive Satellite Onboard Nomadic (BISON) Multipurpose trailer that can be deployed as a temporary satellite connection or can serve as a full mobile cell site.Cell on Wheels (COW) Trailer based mobile cell site equipment that may or may not have self-contained mastsSatellite Trailer Universal Design (STUD) Trailer based unit w/1.8m satellite dish capable of functioning as a temporary satellite connection or can serve as a full mobile cell site.LTE as a Mobile Asset (LAAMA) Trailer based LTE asset with pop up mast and antennas in a small form factor.High Altitude Wireless Kennewhat (HAWK) Tethered drone aircraft capable of lifting eFemto or small cell solution up to 300’ and providing service from the air.WiFi on Light Frame (WOLF) Lightweight wifi trailer with short mast to deploy wifi solutions.Node on Wheels (NOW) or Small Cell Node of Wheels (SNOW) Trailer based small cell node solution.Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response (THOR) Mobile cell site on a tactical vehicle boasting a private core and local MEC, eNB, satellite, multi-purpose solutionTHOR’s Hammer Trailer based equipment that attaches to Thor with expanded node on wheels capabilitiesMatsing Equipment on Wheels (MEOW) Large capacity antenna mounted on a scissor lift that gets paired with Big MAC equipment trailer to handle large capacity events.Bi-directional Amplifier Truck (BAT) Cell signal repeater vehicle with mast to repeat cell signal.Cell Repeater on Wheels (CROW) Trailer based cellular repeater asset.Mobile assets to restore parts of the permanent network Satellite Trailer Emitting Equipment Remote (STEER) Satellite equipment on a trailer to support restoration of macro cells (temporarily takes the place of fiber to connect cell towers to the rest of the network.)Generator on a Truck (GOAT) Large truck mounted generator to support switch commercial power.Mobile Central Radio Access Network  (CRAN) Mobile trailer/rig with equipment needed to replace or restore a CRAN hub.Micro Outdoor Use Satellite Equipment (MOUSE) Small auto-point satellite solution that gets paired with an eFemto or similar solutionPlug In Generator (PIG) Portable generator on a trailer to restore or provide power.Tower on Wheels (TOW) Towable crank up temporary tower.Big Multiple Amplifiers Contained Trailer (Big MAC) Trailer based asset containing multiple remote radio heads and base band units.UAS/ Drones  Smaller drones used for site inspections and assessments*Based on publicly available information.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864-561-1527Karen.Schulz@Verizonwireless.com]"

The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform, followed closely by rival chip players such as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).If the gains in Nvidia hold, the company’s market value would rise more than $200 billion, which would mark the biggest one-day rise in history. Apple's $191 billion pop in November 2022 is the current record holder.It was Nvidia's outlook that truly surprised the investing masses.The company expects second-quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the conference call the very upbeat outlook reflects a fundamental shift to accelerated computing. In turn, that places Nvidia's chips that power generative AI in high demand.""We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,"" Huang said. ""You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.""Here's the vibe on Wall Street after Nvidia's big quarter and outlook.Ruben Roy, Stifel (Hold rating; $370 price target, up from $300): ""Nvidia's recent momentum continued as first quarter results beat consensus expectations and the company's second quarter revenue outlook was significantly above high expectations. Nvidia remains in the sweet spot of AI-infrastructure wallet share as build outs of accelerated computing networks continue. As the company's data center numbers grow, questions on the near-term supply environment are likely to continue. For now, while not providing explicit longer-term guidance, Nvidia management noted that data center-related demand visibility has increased and that the company has procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. We raise our estimates and target price and continue to view Nvidia as the best positioned near-term beneficiary of CSP capex spending trends.""Story continuesNvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming in this undated handout photo provided September 20, 2022. Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS (Handout . / reuters)Tristan Gerra, Baird (Outperform rating, upgrade from Hold; $475 price target, up from $300): ""We raised our estimates above consensus and added a Fresh Pick designation to Nvidia on March 20 reflecting our channel feedback about strong H100 orders notably related to ChatGPT emerging in March but we failed to upgrade at that time. As AI-related order momentum continues into the second half, annualized earnings of $10 are at reach within 2-3 quarters in our view, reflected in the valuation post earnings. Our raised next two-year EPS forecast assumes continued AI-related momentum driven by two secular growth trends: continued adoption rate for parallel processing-based acceleration in data centers, and the emergence of AI models notably related to ChatGPT and LLMs [large language models], all of which require GPUs.""Atif Malik, Citi (Buy rating; $420 price target, up from $353): ""While we had raised our target price and estimates into the earnings, Generative AI upside was bigger than we expected. Nvidia expects data center sales to roughly double in the July quarter driven by Gen AI demand from CSPs, consumer internet companies, and accelerated computing in enterprises. Nvidia estimates only ~4% of the $1 trillion data center CPU installed base over the last four years has been GPU accelerated, implying AI adoption remains in early innings.""Dan Ives, Wedbush (no rating/price target): ""There is not one better indicator around underlying AI demand going on in the hyperscale/cloud and overall enterprise market than the foundational Nvidia story. We view Nvidia at the core hearts and lungs of the AI revolution given its core chips train and deploy generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The Street was all awaiting last night's Nvidia quarter and guidance to gauge the magnitude of this AI demand story with many skeptics saying an AI bubble was forming and instead Jensen &amp; Co. delivered guidance for the ages.""Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank (Hold rating; $390 price target, up from $170): ""After such a massive beat/raise/share price pop, the key question going forward is sustainability. We believe the drivers of it appear to be much more secular than cyclical (AI, DC accelerators crowding out CPUs, etc.), and Nvidia's lead in this market remains sizable, but we remain uncertain as to the pace of such growth post second quarter and if/when the next DC digestion period may occur. Consequently, we are raising our 2024 revenue/EPS by a significant +37%/+70%, with our price target rising to $390 (based upon a consistent 40x P/E multiple). With Nvidia's unique AI market leadership and the scarcity of alternative plays, we see little that could diminish investor optimism and recommend continuing to enjoy the ride.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Given this growing healthcare spending, analysts have presented a positive outlook for the sector in the coming years as well. Healthcare profit pools are projected to grow at a 4% CAGR from $654 billion in 2021 to $790 billion in 2026, as reported by McKinsey &amp; Company.The onset of the pandemic has brought several changes and transformations in the US healthcare system.

According to a report by Deloitte, 68% of physicians offered virtual health options in 2022, compared with just 14% the prior year. The report further mentioned that 57% to 80% of patients prefer telehealth services.

Tim Walz, and other federal, state and local officials joined the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the site earlier this month, underscoring the momentum of the green hydrogen economy and importance of continued innovation in clean tech.""It was an honor to celebrate the opening of Accelera's electrolyzer production line in Fridley alongside Secretary Granholm, Governor Walz and customers and partners from across the U.S. and Canada,"" said Amy Davis, President of Accelera, referring to the May 19 event.""Large-scale electrolysis to produce green hydrogen is a key piece in the decarbonization of transportation and industry,"" Davis said. ""The electrolyzer production capacity we are adding in Fridley will help us scale zero-emissions technologies in North America to meet customer demand and advance adoption. Milestones like this, highlighted by close public-private collaboration, demonstrate our relentless dedication to accelerating the shift to net zero for the industries that keep the world running.""Accelera shared at the event that since the passing of the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, the business has received committed orders for nearly 300 megawatts (MW) of electrolyzer projects in North America. In total, these projects will produce approximately 150 tons of hydrogen per day once commissioned by the end of 2026.Electrolyzers are key technology for separating hydrogen from water.

CMI has signed a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement with Faurecia, a French global automotive supplier and a FORVIA Group Company, to acquire two of the latter’s commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities and related activities.The plants are situated in Roermond, Netherlands (Europe) and Columbus, IN and the purchase price for the deal is EUR142 million (roughly $153 million).Cummins and Faurecia have been allies for over a decade. The divestment by FORVIA Group will offer Cummins to secure the supply of after-treatment components and assembly in the long run.The agreement will give Cummins access to additional technical and manufacturing resources to improve its current mixer portfolio. The added resources will help Cummins meet global emission regulations now and in the foreseeable future. The company intends to maintain its existing relationship with Faurecia in Brazil, India, China and South Africa.Cummins will maintain existing supplier and customer contracts of Faurecia and will make required investments to honor the contracts. Until the deal closes, Cummins, Roermond facility and Columbus facility will remain separate entities and operate independently.The transaction will be financed with the cash on Cummin’s balance sheet. It is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the calendar year 2023.Cummins is the largest engine producer in the world and maintains a diverse global footprint. Its position as a global power leader with a dominant market and a commitment to moving toward a carbon-neutral future is commendable. An impressive product portfolio, strong geographic diversification and a broad global distribution network will boost its long-term prospects. The company's leadership in key technologies for zero tailpipe emissions in commercial and industrial applications and additional efforts to strengthen its foothold in the domain augur well.However, Cummins is witnessing a rise in capex requirements owing to investment in new products and capacity expansion. While this bodes well for the long haul, it is expected to strain near-term financials. Cummins’ capital expenditure in 2022 totaled $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021. In 2023, the company expects capex to rise by approximately $1.2-$1.3 billion.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCMI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Mercedes-Benz Group AG MBGAF, BYD Company Limited BYDDY and Wabash National WNC, all of which sport a Zacks Rank #1.

As good a metaphor for his hosting of Ron DeSantis' presidential announcement on Twitter as you could find (Eric Gay / Associated Press)I was taking my customary siesta Wednesday afternoon when I was jolted awake by the sound of a truck straining to go uphill. Come to discover that I had my computer tuned to Elon Musk's Twitter, where Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was struggling to get out the official announcement of his candidacy for president.The noise turned out to be Musk trying to get the thing to work in real time, amid feedback, weird musical interludes and long stretches of silence. Scheduled to start at 3 p.m. Pacific time, it finally got going on Twitter Spaces, an audio-only application on the platform, about 18 minutes late. I listened, so you don't have to. You're welcome.As he struggled to resolve repeated glitches in Twitter Spaces, Musk and the moderator, a Musk acolyte named David Sacks, kept trying to assert that the technical screw-up was, in fact, a triumph brought about by the large audience. (Sacks claimed that more than 300,000 users had logged in.) ""We are melting the servers, which is a good sign,"" Sacks said early on.You can't have a free society unless we have the freedom to debate the most important issues that are affecting our civilization.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been trying to punish Walt Disney Co. for speaking out against his education lawThis reminded many listeners of the claim by SpaceX, another Musk venture, that its April 20 launch of a prototype rocket, which ended with the vehicle exploding in flight four minutes after liftoff, was a success. Never mind that the launch destroyed the launchpad, showered a neighboring community with debris and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to mount a major investigation.Once it got underway, the Twitter event unfolded as a love fest between DeSantis and Musk. The general theme was what my mother used to describe as ""I like me, who do you like?""It's hard to say whose reputation was shredded more by the fiasco. DeSantis' claim to be a politician in Donald Trump's mold, but smart and competent, may not survive the decision to stage his most important political coming-out on an audio-only feed streamed on a platform that appeals increasingly only to a shrinking, ideologically homogeneous base of right-wingers. A politician with his eyes on the White House should know by instinct that his task is to expand his base, not narrow it.Story continuesAs for Musk's reputation as a smart herder of engineers, that's been waning since he bought Twitter last year and hollowed out its technical staff. But his assertions that he could cut manpower costs without affecting the platform's performance were conclusively refuted Wednesday. Twitter Spaces crashed because of an audience that was tiny compared with those that other platforms such as YouTube handle without glitches. And whose idea was it to launch this event without adequate testing in advance, anyway?Musk and DeSantis praised each other for their dedication to free speech, and Sacks brought on several right-wing sophists to add their voices. They included Jay Bhattacharya, one of the drafters of the Great Barrington Declaration, which, as I reported this week, advocated letting the COVID-19 virus run rampant through the population in quest of the elusive goal of ""herd immunity"" — at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives.Another was Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), whose claim to fame on a national scale was issuing a Christmas tweet in 2021 showing himself, his wife and their five kids brandishing assault weapons. ""Santa, pls bring ammo,"" the tweet read. (In December 2021, there were 39 mass shootings in the U.S., taking 36 lives and wounding 160.)DeSantis said Florida was safer than blue-state cities, where ""you got kids more likely to get shot than to receive a first-class education."" A reminder: One of the worst school shootings in American history took place in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, when 17 people were killed and 17 wounded. In April, DeSantis signed a law allowing Floridians to carry guns without a permit.It would be wrong to say there weren't some lighthearted moments during the Twitter event. Unfortunately for DeSantis, the best joke came from President Biden: While Musk was struggling to get the event launched, Biden posted a tweet that read, ""This link works,"" pointing to a fundraising site for the Biden-Harris campaign.If you were looking for policy prescriptions from the freshly minted candidate, you didn't hear anything new. Put it this way: If you were at a party where you had to down a shot of whiskey every time DeSantis uttered the word ""woke,"" you were reduced to insensibility within 10 or 20 minutes. If the drinking game included a shot when DeSantis took a shot at ""the legacy media,"" you may have needed to get your stomach pumped.Other than that, it was a festival of cynical lies and rank hypocrisies uttered by DeSantis.He spoke up for free speech and open debate, for instance. ""People should be exposed to different viewpoints,"" he said. ""You can't have a free society unless we have the freedom to debate the most important issues that are affecting our civilization.""This is the guy who has waged a ferocious battle with Walt Disney Co. because Disney had spoken out against his ""Don't Say Gay"" law, which stifles the teaching of gender issues in the schools.Read more: Column: A glimpse into the dystopian abyss of President DeSantis' AmericaWhen Sacks primed him with a question about the fight with Disney, DeSantis replied, ""We believe jamming gender ideology in elementary school is wrong; Disney obviously supported injecting gender ideology in elementary school."" He added that Disney's ""corporate culture had really been outed as trying to inject matters of sex into the programming for the youth."" One doesn't have to be a fan of Disney to see that as fatuous claptrap.DeSantis also dismissed accusations that Florida is a hotbed of book-banning as ""a hoax."" All his administration has done, he said, has been ""to empower parents with the ability to review the curriculum, to know what books are being used in school."" That's one way of looking at it.The right way is to observe that he's empowered a tiny cadre of reactionary activists to force books they don't like off the shelves of Florida schools. As the Washington Post reported Wednesday, a majority of the complaints about schoolbooks nationwide have come from just 11 complainants. Florida ranks second among the states in the number of schoolbook challenges, after Texas.By the way, one of the Republican toadies DeSantis appointed to the board created to oversee Disney's development district (as part of his retaliation against the company) is Bridget Ziegler, co-founder of the right-wing censorship-happy organization Moms for Liberty.When Bhattacharya came online, DeSantis took the opportunity to boast about his success against the COVID pandemic. The truth is that Florida's record is one of abject, lethal failure. Florida's COVID death rate of 411 per 100,000 population is the 10th worst in the nation. DeSantis has appointed Bhattacharya to a state panel investigating federal COVID policy.DeSantis claimed to have based his COVID policies on his determination to ""look at the data. ... There was a concerted effort to try to stifle dissent."" This can be interpreted only as some kind of gag. DeSantis installed a COVID crackpot, Joseph Ladapo, as Florida's surgeon general.Ladapo has promoted useless anti-COVID nostrums such as ivermectin, and counseled against the COVID vaccines. ""Looking at the data""? As the Tampa Bay Times has reported, based on official state documents, Ladapo deliberately removed data from an official state report on the vaccines that contradicted his claim that the vaccines were unsafe for young men; in fact, studies show that the vaccines are far safer for them than being infected by the virus.The event ended with a paean by Musk and DeSantis to cryptocurrency, which is tantamount to enticing innocent small investors into immolating their nest eggs in a scam.""We should do it again,"" DeSantis said in closing the feed. ""We'll make sure that we come back and do it again. This is a great platform.""We shall see. The next DeSantis appearance on Twitter could be just as buggy, or worse. All that we can be sure of is that whatever happens, Elon Musk will deem it a great success.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Ron DeSantis ought to have a sunny story to sell as he launches his run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Florida is the fastest-growing state in the nation, and since DeSantis took over in 2019, it has outperformed the rest of the country in job and income growth, especially during the COVID pandemic.Yet DeSantis is no benevolent Reaganite, stepping aside to let capitalism work its magic. Instead, he’s one of the most meddlesome governors in America, happily upsetting the status quo as part of his war on liberal culture. DeSantis’s smackdown with the Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Florida’s biggest taxpayer, is a looming political debacle that DeSantis could lose in the courts just as the 2024 campaign is heating up. DeSantis brags about taking on Disney and its “woke culture” as if most Americans, if forced to pick sides, would choose a petulant governor over an entertainment colossus. Risky bet.It's not just Disney. DeSantis’s forced revisions of Florida’s racial history have prompted the NAACP to issue a travel advisory warning that Florida “has become hostile to Black Americans.” An LGBTQ advocacy group has issued a similar warning. That threatens Florida tourism, the state's biggest industry. Some Hispanic truckers are urging a boycott of the state in response to a new law DeSantis signed meant to flush out undocumented workers at businesses with 25 employees or more. Then there’s DeSantis’s push to kill diversity programs at Florida’s public schools and universities, some of them funded in part by wealthy donors who are opposed to DeSantis’s stampede.DeSantis won reelection last November by a 19-point margin, creating a wide opening for a presidential run. But controversies since then have slowed his momentum. “The overriding reason for DeSantis’s electoral success was keeping the economy in Florida relatively open during COVID,” said John Mousseau, CEO of investing firm Cumberland Advisors, based in Sarasota. “That really resonated with voters. I think all the other stuff that is out there lately, Disney, college curriculums, immigration, transgender laws, all of this has a net effect of giving voters DeSantis fatigue. If last fall’s gubernatorial election were held now, I think the results would be closer.”Story continues[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]In his recent book, “The Courage to be Free,” DeSantis explains how he wants to “Make America Florida.” That will mean different things to different people. As a sun-belt mecca with no state income tax, Florida has a built-in allure to many businesses and workers. But DeSantis is applying a kind of strong-arm capitalism in which the state issues cultural guidelines it expects businesses to follow as a condition of enjoying Florida’s largesse. As a pitch to Republicans in a bid to win the presidential nomination, it could work. General-election voters, however, may not wish to be Floridafied.Like other successful politicians, DeSantis is a beneficiary of good fortune. He became governor one year after Congress passed a tax law that, among other things, capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, which effectively made it more expensive for high earners to live in high-tax states. Florida is a low-tax state, and it has enjoyed a surge of wealthy Americans moving in since the tax law passed. That gooses the state’s economy.FILE - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Feb. 24, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux, File)As a warm southern state, Florida also had a natural advantage in weathering the COVID pandemic. DeSantis repeatedly bashes “lockdown politicians” who ordered businesses to close during the first year of the pandemic while Florida remained largely open. Yet in some epicenters of the virus, such as New York City, officials had no choice but to shut down as hospitals filled to capacity and a surging death toll generated panic. Warmer areas where it was possible to do some business outside, where COVID is harder to transmit, simply didn’t face the same scale of difficulty.In 2020, the first year of the pandemic, Florida had one of the lowest COVID death rates, even though it mostly stayed open. That hints at the benefits of a warm climate. In 2021, however, Florida’s COVID death rate doubled, and even went higher than shutdown states such as New York and California. Florida’s high concentration of older people is probably part of the reason, but the jump from 2020 to 2021 also suggests stronger protections could have saved lives.Florida presents a few other liabilities a DeSantis opponent could exploit. Home insurance costs have skyrocketed due to ruinous storms and a fraud epidemic. DeSantis has signed legislation to address the problem but it's not clear it will work. Florida's cost of living is also going up as people flood into the state, with some residents complaining that it's getting too expensive.Still, every state has its woes, and many governors would trade Florida's problems for their own. DeSantis could easily claim credit for Florida’s economic success and run as a traditional laissez-faire Republican favoring low taxes and light regulation. Instead, he has hitched his star to the “war on wokeness,” including attacks on businesses with diversity and inclusion policies meant to show solidarity with racial and cultural minorities. Instead of a light government touch, DeSantis’s war on wokeness can amount to a heavy-handed intrusion into the way businesses operate.The Disney battle began last year when the company publicly opposed a new Florida law limiting what schools can teach young kids about sex and gender. DeSantis retaliated by attempting to strip the municipal self-governing status Disney had enjoyed near its Orlando theme park for decades. Disney orchestrated a legal maneuver to reclaim that status, which DeSantis tried to nullify. Disney is now suing while also cutting back on investment in Florida. CEO Bob Iger charges DeSantis with creating an “anti-business” climate in the state.DeSantis brags about taking on Disney, as if he’s a courageous everyman taking on a tyrannical Goliath. If he were president, however, there’d be many more corporations he could target for social policies meant to keep up with evolving norms and values. His war on wokeness could even be self-escalating if he backed new laws or regulations on cultural values that forced companies to take a stand in opposition.How far would DeSantis go to combat wokeness? Would he use the power of federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to punish disfavored companies? Would he try to block mergers based on personal grievances, as Donald Trump tried to do as president? Is that what voters really want, anyway?Probably not. Many Americans don’t even know what wokeness is, and among those who do, more consider it a positive thing than a negative. DeSantis is clearly trying to establish himself as a Trumpy culture warrior without Donald Trump’s personal baggage, since that seems the best way to win the presidential nomination in a party that has veered sharply right during the last decade. Yet DeSantis has fallen further behind Trump in early polling as the Disney battle has intensified and more people have learned about the Florida governor. Trump’s lead over DeSantis has widened from 16 points in March to 33 points in the latest FiveThirtyEight composite.DeSantis’s nascent campaign is already well-funded, and at least one business titan — Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk — has his back. So DeSantis likely has enough support to sustain a long campaign, even if the polls don’t break his way.Now we wait to see if DeSantis can offer peace with prosperity, or only war.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

The company’s modernization of infrastructure and cost-saving initiatives will further improve margins.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock faces risks related to the failure of transmission lines and adherence to stringent regulations.TailwindsExelon is focused on organic growth. During 2023-2026, it plans to invest nearly $31.3 billion in regulated utility operations for grid modernization and to increase the resilience of its infrastructure. These investments will support rate-based growth of nearly 8% through 2026.The separation of the power generation and competitive energy business, namely Constellation Energy Corp., into a separate entity will allow Exelon’s management to concentrate on the transmission and distribution of clean energy. Nearly 73% of Exelon’s distribution revenues are decoupled, which insulates the top line from the impact of load fluctuations and leads to stable earnings.Exelon’s stable cash flow allows management to continue distributing regular dividends. The board of directors announced a quarterly dividend raise of 6.7%. The annual dividend reflects a  yield of 3.59%, which is better than the industry average of 3.37%.HeadwindsExelon’s delivery business is highly regulated and could be subject to regulatory and legislative actions that adversely affect its operations or financial results.

236,9a501631-31d1-3b4b-ae67-b311d5599442,OKE,2023-05-25,Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Acquisition News From ONEOK and Chevron Take Center Stage,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-gas-stock-roundup-acquisition-122200911.html,1684930920,STORY,"['CVX', 'OKE', 'LNG', 'XOM', 'FTI']","[It was a week when both oil and natural gas prices posted gains.On the news front, the headlines came from midstream firm ONEOK Inc. OKE and energy major Chevron’s CVX acquisition announcements. Developments associated with ExxonMobil XOM, Cheniere Energy LNG and TechnipFMC FTI also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a bullish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 2.2% to close at $71.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices jumped 14.1% to end at $2.59 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).In particular, oil prices climbed on reported progress toward U.S. debt-ceiling resolution though gains were capped by continued recession fears.Meanwhile, natural gas performed even better following a lower-than-expected increase in stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states and the hint of tightening supply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.  ONEOK, a prominent energy infrastructure provider, is set to acquire smaller pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners in a significant cash-and-stock transaction worth $18.8 billion. This deal is expected to create one of the largest oil and natural gas pipeline companies in the United States.The agreement represents a current implied value of $67.50 per unit to each Magellan unitholder, for a 22% premium, based on the May 12, 2023, closing prices. ONEOK's acquisition of MMP marks a significant development in the energy infrastructure industry.The two premier firms have joined forces to create a combined company with a net enterprise value of $60.0 billion. This new midstream giant will have a diversified portfolio of assets across North America and provide services to customers in the energy industry. (ONEOK Buys Magellan for $18.8B, Creates Midstream Giant)2. Chevron recently revealed its plans to acquire upstream company PDC Energy in a transformative all-stock transaction valued at $6.3 billion. According to the terms of the agreement, PDC stockholders will get 0.4638 Chevron shares for every PDC share, for a total enterprise value of $7.6 billion, including debt. This strategic move is expected to strengthen Chevron's position in key U.S. production basins, unlock new opportunities, and drive higher returns for the American multinational firm.In the Denver-Julesburg Basin, PDC Energy offers Chevron a number of benefits, including strong free cash flow, low breakeven production, and development potential close to the company's current operations. The acquisition will provide Chevron with additional acreage in the Permian Basin, bolstering its leading position in one of the world's most prolific oil and gas regions.The transaction is expected to yield several benefits, such as an increase in earnings per share, free cash flow, and return on capital employed. Chevron anticipates the acquisition to be accretive to all key financial measures within the first year after closing and to generate approximately $1 billion in annual free cash flow, based on projected future prices.3. U.S. supermajor ExxonMobil, through its subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. and affiliates, entered into an agreement to divest Williston Basin assets to Chord Energy for $375 million. The transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand, which was $592 million as of Mar 31, 2023.ExxonMobil, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, is expected to have started selling hydrocarbon-containing properties as it seeks to cut down debt by divesting some of its non-core assets. The transaction is expected to be closed by the end of June 2023 and be retroactive from Apr 1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The divested assets involve about 62,000 net acres in Williston Basin within and adjacent to near-term development program. Almost 77% of this is undeveloped. The low-cost, tier-one assets are highly competitive with Chord Energy’s existing portfolio and further extend its inventory runway. (ExxonMobil Signs Deal to Divest Williston Basin Assets)4   A subsidiary of gas exporter Cheniere Energy subsidiary entered into a long-term liquefied natural gas sale and purchase agreement (""SPA"") with Korea Southern Power Co. Ltd (""KOSPO""). This agreement set the stage for a mutually beneficial partnership spanning two decades.Under the terms of the SPA, KOSPO will purchase approximately 0.4 million tons per annum (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas from Cheniere Marketing. Delivery of the same will commence in 2024 and continue until 2046.The long-term nature of the SPA signifies the commitment between Cheniere Energy and KOSPO. The agreement ensures a steady supply of liquefied natural gas to meet KOSPO's energy demands. It also reinforces Cheniere's position as a leading liquefied natural gas provider in the global market. Over the course of the contract, KOSPO will receive approximately 0.4 million tons of LNG annually, contributing to the stability and security of South Korea's energy infrastructure. (Cheniere &amp; Korea Southern Power Sign Long-Term LNG Deal)5.   TechnipFMC, a leading global provider of subsea solutions, secured a contract from Norwegian behemoth Equinor to deliver Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI) services on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This two-year contract (2024-2025) comes with an option for extension over the subsequent three years.Per the agreement, TechnipFMC will deliver production enhancement, data and pre-plug-and-abandonment services to Equinor using the RLWI method. The primary goal is to optimize the performance of Equinor's assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, thereby improving production rates and extending the lifespan of the existing wells.The above-mentioned contract, with a value of $75-$250 million, is expected to contribute to TechnipFMC's inbound orders in the second quarter of 2023. This will further strengthen the company’s market position and reinforce its expertise in providing efficient and cost-effective RLWI services.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — rose 1.4% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has decreased 14.9%.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for guidance on the direction of the commodities. In this context, the U.S. Government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. Currently, news related to the political standoff over the U.S. debt ceiling will be the key factor that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Akamai Technologies basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Akamai Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Akamai Technologies to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

241,f333e22d-fa35-398a-a43a-f7fb31a1b965,JNPR,2023-05-25,3 Top Dividend Stocks to Maximize Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-maximize-131004037.html,1684933804,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Believe it or not, seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.21%. This compares to the Retail - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 105.13%. Check Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Juniper Networks (JNPR) is paying out a dividend of $0.22 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3% compared to the Wireless Equipment industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 4.76% over the past year. Check Juniper Networks (JNPR) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.52 per share, MetLife (MET) has a dividend yield of 4.01%. This is compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.16% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 4.17%. Check MetLife (MET) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified. See our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA ps-multiple-vs-industryWhat Does DENTSPLY SIRONA's Recent Performance Look Like?DENTSPLY SIRONA could be doing better as its revenue has been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive revenue growth. The P/S ratio is probably low because investors think this poor revenue performance isn't going to get any better. So while you could say the stock is cheap, investors will be looking for improvement before they see it as good value.If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on DENTSPLY SIRONA.How Is DENTSPLY SIRONA's Revenue Growth Trending?DENTSPLY SIRONA's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the industry.In reviewing the last year of financials, we were disheartened to see the company's revenues fell to the tune of 5.8%. Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with revenue growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing revenue over that time.Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 1.5% during the coming year according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 8.3% growth forecast for the broader industry.With this information, we can see why DENTSPLY SIRONA is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On DENTSPLY SIRONA's P/SIt's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.As expected, our analysis of DENTSPLY SIRONA's analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.You should always think about risks.

While the stock has lost 7.1% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for XRAYThe RSI reading of 26.58 for XRAY is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for XRAYThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for XRAY has increased 2%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, XRAY currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

Arcadia is the latest community in Florida to roll out these Xfinity 10G Network enhancements, setting the stage for the introduction of new symmetrical multi-gigabit internet options that can be delivered across Comcast’s existing networks with less cost.Comcast expects to complete the network expansion by the end of the summer, making services available in the City of Arcadia, and parts of other areas in DeSoto County, including Nocatee and Lake Suzy.

For more top AI stocks, head on over to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. The hottest trend in technology right now is artificial intelligence. This is simply due to the fact that for the general consumer, artificial intelligence is mostly associated with sci-fi grade technology with the potential to create entities with human like intelligence and response. However, until most of 2022, such technologies were not available to captivate the public attention. Most chatbots were rather rudimentary and lacked the ability to provide detailed responses.However, all this changed with the release of ChatGPT, a conversational assistant trained on vast amounts of data and capable of generating human like responses to queries. ChatGPT set the internet on fire, and within days and weeks after its initial and public release, all tech and non tech publications were simply gushing about the assistant. As is the case with hype, it often goes far beyond what logic might suggest, and soon we were being warned that professionals such as lawyers might have to switch careers as a virtual assistant can provide better services.All this hype has made everyone forget what artificial intelligence really is. Simply put, AI is the use of complex mathematical techniques to use a set of inputs, plug them in an equation, and then determine the most likely set of outcomes. So, if you ask ChatGPT about companies with reusable rockets, it will sift through its data to determine which are the most likely matches and likely give you an answer that includes SpaceX.This utility of using large scale data analysis to generate a likely set of outputs provides artificial intelligence with far more utility than a simple chatbot. One of the best use cases of artificial intelligence that does not involve talking is autonomous driving. This involves feeding a computer in a car data through a variety of sensors such as LiDAR sensors, and programming it in such a way that it is able to make decisions that mimic human behavior like knowing when to stop and when to turn. Building on this, the consulting firm McKinsey takes a look at other sectors that can use AI. Its report for the 2022 use cases for AI shows that a variety of sectors such as robotic process automation, knowledge graphs, facial recognition, and recommender systems are using artificial intelligence as well. Functionally speaking, McKinsey reports that the largest users of artificial intelligence are service operators, customer service analytics, and customer generation and lead generation platforms.Story continuesOne firm that leads in the customer services arena is Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). It provides customer engagement and analytics platforms. During its earnings call for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023, its executives shared the inside scoop on Salesforce's Einstein GPT - the world's first generative language artificial intelligence platform for customer relationship management and details for other plans to integrate AI into the overall business.During the event, they shared:EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack. And then there’s another way we’re opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customers’, as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, I’ve been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while it’s inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldn’t be more excited about the future. To wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. We’re making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well.Given these explosive use cases, it's important to look at a wide list of firms currently developing and deploying the AI technology. Some topics AI picks from hedge funds include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best AI stocks, we first made a list of all firms that are developing and have deployed the technology.

In an extraordinary letter docketed on Tuesday, a Delaware judge said he did not intend to accuse plaintiffs lawyers of sexism when he said that one of their theories in long-running litigation against Oracle Corp founder Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz “had some odor of denigrating the abilities of women executives to succeed based on their merits.”“I have, I fear, done plaintiffs’ counsel a disservice,” wrote Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock of Delaware Chancery Court in Tuesday’s letter. “Nothing in plaintiffs’ litigation of the case implied sexism. I have great respect for the Robbins Geller and Friedlander &amp; Gorris firms, and for the individual counsel who have tried the Oracle matter ably over several years.”Glasscock’s letter addressed a footnote in his May 12 decision clearing Ellison and Catz of breaching their duties to shareholders. I highlighted the footnote in a May 15 column about the ruling.Plaintiffs, as you may recall, had alleged that Ellison and Catz pushed the company to overpay in Oracle's $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite Inc in 2016 to score big profits for Ellison, who held a nearly 40% stake in NetSuite. Glasscock concluded that Ellison did not control the Oracle board and that Catz was a tough negotiator who acted in Oracle's best interests.Glasscock’s fateful footnote criticized an additional claim that plaintiffs had brought — and later dismissed — against former Oracle board member Renee James, who chaired the special committee that negotiated the NetSuite deal.Plaintiffs’ theory was that at the time of the NetSuite negotiations, James was exploring the next step of her career, after stepping down as president of Intel Corp, and could not independently evaluate the NetSuite deal because she needed Ellison’s support to advance in the tech industry.Glasscock had allowed shareholder lawyers to pursue that claim at the 2022 trial but at a posttrial hearing, he said the theory had been disproved. The plaintiffs then voluntarily tossed the case against James before Glasscock ruled on their claims against Ellison and Catz.Story continuesThe judge nevertheless included the footnote criticizing plaintiffs' theory in the May 12 decision.In the new letter, Glasscock explained why. “I was concerned that, in addressing this argument (as I did when considering and denying James’ motion for summary judgment), I could be seen as furthering a pernicious generalization: that women, uniquely, use relationships in an invidious manner, to compensate for barriers to advancement that are themselves invidious,” the judge wrote. “Obviously, I do not endorse this view.”Glasscock acknowledged that his language in the footnote was “imprecise,” and could have led to an impression that he was leveling sexism accusations against plaintiffs lawyers from Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd and Friedlander &amp; Gorris.That was the implication I detected in my column about the footnote.But Glasscock said in the new letter he did not intend to suggest plaintiffs had advanced arguments or theories that denigrated women. “The plaintiffs’ briefing and argument was within all ethical bounds,” he said. “I should have made that clear in the context of the footnote regarding Ms. James. I have placed this letter on the docket in an attempt to correct any misperceptions I have caused.”It's not clear what prompted Glasscock to clarify the record. A clerk in his chambers said on Wednesday morning that the judge was in court and unavailable to comment on the letter. Sidley Austin, which represents former Oracle director James, did not immediately respond to a query about the new letter. James did not immediately respond to a query sent to her company, Ampere Computing.Joel Friedlander of Friedlander &amp; Gorris and Randall Baron of Robbins Geller said in email statements that they were gratified by Glasscock’s action. “I very much appreciate the vice chancellor’s letter,” Friedlander said.Baron called the judge “a genuinely good and honorable person,” adding, “I really respect the fact that he clarified a footnote that we truly believed did not reflect our litigation position.”Peter Wald and Blair Connelly of Latham &amp; Watkins, who led the defense for Ellison and Catz, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Plaintiffs lawyers this week moved for a fee award of $5 million from Oracle, arguing that their early efforts prodded the company's board to elect two additional, independent directors in 2018. The addition of independent board members, they said, was a benefit to the corporation.Read more:Lawyers suing Oracle draw judge's reproach for arguments with 'odor of denigrating' womenOracle directors: Shareholders can go ahead with billion-dollar derivative suit(Reporting By Alison Frankel)]"

Bloomberg reported in April that CXMT's IPO would target a valuation of more than $14.5 billion.The sources said a handful of other local investment banks are expected to take more junior roles in the deal, and bookrunners for the offering had still to be finalized.CXMT, CICC and China Securities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this week a U.S. lawmaker asked the U.S. Commerce Department to put trade curbs on CXMT after Beijing banned the sale of some chips made by U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc .Analysts believe CXMT's chips are two to three generations behind industry leaders Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix, but the company is the domestic competitor most likely to benefit if Micron is barred from China's massive chip market.The proposed IPO comes amid mounting diplomatic and trade tensions between China and the United States.Washington has sought to curb exports of chip-making equipment to China, requiring licenses for U.S. companies to export advanced chips and chip-making equipment in a bid to slow China's technological advances.CXMT has one fab in operation and is building two others. According to research firm Trendforce, equipment export restrictions imposed by the United States since October might affect its expansion plans.CXMT will join a growing list of Chinese chipmakers looking to sell shares publicly on the mainland.Chinese chipmaker Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd said last week that it had received Shanghai Stock Exchange approval for its planned $2.6 billion share listing, which is expected to be one of the country's biggest this year.Story continuesCXMT's listing plan appears to be in early stages as it has yet to submit application to the country's securities regulator for the so-called pre-IPO tutoring with banks, a search on China Securities Regulatory Commission website showed.In a domestic listing, companies will formally file for a float after advisers have instructed them on the IPO process.CXMT's listing, if materialises, will add to a busy year for IPOs in China, as companies revive their plans after the world's second-largest economy reopened after three years of COVID-induced lockdown.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see McDonald's' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that McDonald's Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$424m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dollar Tree (DLTR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 one day from its next quarterly earnings release on May 25, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.53 a share.DLTR has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.04%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.53 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51.DLTR is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. McDonald's (MCD) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.McDonald's is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 25, 2023. MCD's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.75 a share 62 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's is $2.75, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.17%.Story continuesDLTR and MCD's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

263,3a18dad5-a3ef-33cb-ba78-6e451567e7f5,MCD,2023-05-25,4 Blue-Chip Stocks From a Struggling Dow for a Stable Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-blue-chip-stocks-struggling-122400024.html,1684931040,STORY,"['CAT', 'COMP', 'MCD', 'PG', '^GSPC', 'WMT']","[U.S. stock markets have rallied year to date. after wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008 and terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Changes Course in 2023Several economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms.Consequently, the Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike in 2023. In his post-FOMC statement in May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank may keep interest rate unchanged at the current 5-5.25% range.A lower rate hike has enabled growth sector like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive this year. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 20% year to date. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index has also seen a decent rally of 8%. However, the Dow is down 0.3% so far this year.Our Top PicksDefying a struggling Dow, we have narrowed our search to four blue-Chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.The Construction Industries segment of CAT is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. Caterpillar’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help CAT deliver outsized returns.Zacks Rank #1 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.5% and 27.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.8% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. MCD continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #1 McDonald's has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 30 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services. WMT’s U.S. comp sales continued gaining from an increased market share in grocery in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4% for the current year and earnings growth rate of 10.5% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last seven days.The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG has benefitted from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG’s products play a key role in meeting the daily health, hygiene and cleaning needs of consumers around the world. PG has witnessed continued strong momentum as reflected by the underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided its organic sales growth.Procter &amp; Gamble remains focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. PG’s continued investment in the business alongside its efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscores its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of the business.Zacks Rank #2 Procter &amp; Gamble has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for next fiscal year (June 2024).

264,2d73e5d9-28dd-3121-b633-23e8666cfce4,PLD,2023-05-25,Thinking of Buying Prologis? These Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-prologis-properties-tenants-164620400.html,1684946780,STORY,"['PLD', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'FDX', 'HD']","[When investors buy real estate investment trusts (REITs), they aren’t just buying real estate companies. They also are buying the tenants that comprise the REITs leasing portfolio.Before you decide to buy any REIT, consider the stability and solvency of its tenant base. Consider these questions: Are any tenants facing bankruptcy or closing a large number of locations? Are the tenants high quality? Are the tenants diversified, not only geographically but also by industry? And finally, what is the percentage of each tenant’s annual base rent (ABR) in the total tenant portfolio?Take a look at one well-known retail REIT and consider the questions raised above in evaluating its merits. Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owners and manages approximately 1.2 billion square feet in just under 5,500 industrial logistics properties throughout the U.S. and 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, the company has long been a leader in appreciation among REIT stocks.In addition to leasing space through a program known as the Essentials Platform, Prologis supplies equipment, robotics and other services to its customers to enhance business operations.Prologis is the largest REIT by market capitalization, with a cap rate of $13.02 billion and has been a stalwart among REITs for the last 25 years. During that time, it has a total return of 571.39% for those taking dividends and 1,282.25% for investors who reinvest the dividends. Its 2023 year-to-date total return is 11.01%.Through the years, Prologis has been known as a growth-oriented REIT rather than for having a high-yielding dividend. But over the past five years, Prologis has increased its quarterly dividend by 81.25% from $0.48 to $0.87 per share. The $3.48 annual dividend yields 2.84%.One of Prologis’s strengths is the diversity of its portfolio in geographical location, types of goods, industries and the percentage of ABR per tenant. The chart below shows the top 10 tenants as well as the diversification of goods in Prologis’s buildings:Story continuesYou can also see the geographic diversity of its portfolio net operating income (NOI) from the chart below:Geographic diversity reduces risks Prologis would develop should any one area of the world fall into recession. But because 86% of Prologis’s NOI comes from the U.S., it remains its most important geographic region by far.Prologis gets high marks for its stable-to-increasing occupancy rates and customer retention over the past year, but despite its first-quarter 2023 occupancy rate of 98%, there was a slight drop in the rate from the fourth quarter of 2022 and a more troubling 5.2% drop in customer retention.Whether this is the beginning of a downward trend in occupancy and retention or just a one-quarter anomaly remains to be seen. From the chart below, it’s noteworthy that the occupancy and retention rates are higher than they were in the first quarter of 2022 and that its occupancy rates throughout the rest of the world are stable and in the mid- to upper-90th percentile.Below is a chart showing the geographic breakdown of each area of the U.S. and other countries by square feet, occupancy and leased percentage. One minor concern is the percentage of total square feet being leased in the three large metropolitan areas of Southern California, New Jersey/New York City and Chicago. Together, these areas make up over 26% of Prologis’s total square footage in the U.S. But because the demand for industrial space in large urban areas is far greater at the present time than it is for office space, this may not be a problem going forward.Prologis’ top customers are some of the largest and most well-known companies in the world. The list includes Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD), FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT). This means consistency and stability when it comes to rent collections.One recent concern is that Amazon currently leases 5.2% of Prologis’s total square feet. Between 2020 to 2021, Amazon purchased over $450 million in industrial space and land with the intent to downsize the amount of space that it leases from Prologis and other industrial REITs.During Prologis’ second-quarter 2022 conference call, the executives were asked about Amazon’s announcement that it would be unloading a great deal of leased space because of overcapacity. Prologis responded that it was 99% occupied in areas where Amazon was leasing space and that existing rents were 54% below market, so finding new tenants would not be difficult should Amazon terminate its leases.Keep in mind that Amazon was renting about 33.4 million square feet from Prologis. While finding new tenants could be easy, there is often significant expense and lost revenue from the time a large tenant leaves until a new tenant moves in. New buildouts, carrying costs and rent incentives could significantly impact Prologis’ bottom line.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketTenant ProfilesIn addition to Amazon, other large tenants in Prologis’ portfolio include:Home Depot Inc. is Prologis’ second-largest tenant with 1.7% of its ABR. Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. and one of the most successful companies in America over the 45 years since its inception. Going back to 1995, it has an average annual total return of 13.8%. Home Depot has an A/A2 rating by S&amp;P/Moody’s. Amazon and Walmart, two other top 10 tenants in Prologis’ portfolio, also have very high ratings.FedEx is a Memphis, Tennessee-based multinational company that provides logistic services such as deliveries, shipping, transportation, e-commerce and business solutions. It was founded in 1971 by Frederick W. Smith as an overnight courier service but has expanded its services greatly since then. It had its initial public offering (IPO) in December 1978. Deutsch bank recently maintained a Buy rating on FedEx shares and raised its price target from $240 to $282 per share.FedEx comprises 1.4% of the total square footage of Prologis’s leases.Walmart is a Bentonville, Arkansas-based American multinational retail corporation. Walmart operates a large chain of hypermarkets (combined department store and grocery supermarket), discount department stores and stand-alone grocery stores worldwide. It has over 10,500 stores and Sam’s Clubs across 24 different countries and employs 1.6 million people in the U.S.Walmart stores also offer several services, such as auto care centers, financial and photo services and pharmacies. Its Walmart Plus program provides users with discounts on streaming services, free shipping, free delivery, early access to online deals and product releases and savings on gasoline.Walmart was founded in 1962 by Sam and James Walton. Its IPO at $16.50 per share was in August 1972. Today, its annual revenue of $570 billion makes it the largest company by revenue in the world. Of Prologis’ total square footage, 0.6% is leased to Walmart.Recent newsOn April 18, Prologis announced its first-quarter operating results. Funds from operations of $1.22 were in line with analysts’ estimates, but revenue of $1.77 billion beat Wall Street’s view by $120 million and was 45.1% higher than revenue in the first quarter of 2022. Prologis also slightly raised its full-year 2023 guidance, from a range of $5.40-$5.50 to $5.42 to $5.50. The consensus is for $5.50.During the conference call, Prologis Co-Founder and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam said, “Demand remains healthy, despite some moderating in terms of decision-making. Given the macro environment, we continue to operate our business with a degree of caution.  We foresee any potential impact on demand as likely to overlap with a deceleration in new deliveries, sustaining momentum with favorable conditions for high occupancy and continued rent growth into 2024.”As for analysts, most of them tend to be bullish on Prologis. On April 19, UBS analyst Brent Dilts maintained a Buy position on Prologis and raised his price target to $144. On May 3, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll maintained an Outperform rating on Prologis and raised the price target from $144 to $148.Year to date, Prologis has had a total return of 10.2%, making it the second-best industrial REIT performer behind Plymouth Industrial REIT Inc. (NYSE: PLYM) and in the top 5% among all REITs.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

267,c6734dfe-65ac-3454-914b-43c9840c743c,PCAR,2023-05-25,"Used truck prices: What was up has come down, way down",FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/used-truck-prices-come-down-183823139.html,1684953503,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Used truck prices are continuing to fall as the overheated market of a year ago becomes a distant memory. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Used trucks, which a year ago approached unheard of auction and retail prices, have crashed to earth. Soft spot market rates, practically unfettered new truck production and drivers giving up their authorities are all factors.Some fleets and dealers saw the reversal coming. After months of carefully controlled order intake for new trucks, manufacturers opened order books to new bookings. Carriers running their trucks beyond the typical three- to four-year trade-in cycle could plan replacement purchases.Paccar Inc., the parent of Peterbilt, Kenworth and Europe’s DAF Trucks, expects to deliver 51,000 to 54,000 new units this quarter, which ends June 30. Some supply constraints remain but “generally improving circumstances” are expected as the year progresses, Paccar CEO Preston Feight said on an earnings call April 25.That availability of trucks means more used trucks are being offloaded. And that pushes down prices.“There’s been heavy depreciation for the meat of the market since the second quarter of 2022,” Chris Visser, director of specialty vehicles at J.D. Power Valuation Services, told FreightWaves.“Dealers have adapted to depreciation in the sense that the smarter ones saw the market shift happening and did their best to get out from under their high-valued inventory before it went upside down,” he said. “Bids on incoming trades also became more conservative.”More new trucks built means more used trucks pushed to resaleThe build rate and backlog of new trucks waiting to be produced are messing with used truck prices.“Clearly, weak freight volumes and rates coupled with new vehicle sales that are pumping supply into the used market are not the combination of factors required to support used vehicle prices,” Kenny Vieth, president and senior analyst at ACT Research, told FreightWaves.Power’s latest data for used Class 8 trucks showed April-over-March auction prices falling between 2.1% and 11% for its benchmark 3- to 7-year-old truck.Story continuesOnly 2021 models bucked that trend, rising 17.2%, or $15,000, in April compared to March. But Visser was quick to point out that small volumes of available trucks can skew the comparisons.Late-model trucks sold for 8% less in April than March and 48.5% less than April 2022. In the first four months of 2023, late-model sleepers brought 47% less than a year earlier. Monthly depreciation in 2023 is currently averaging 5.8%.Since March, Visser said, Power has seen a swell of trucks going to the used market “relatively easily identified as being from at least one large fleet. Those trucks are certainly a factor in the pricing downturn.”Used truck prices slightly better at retail than auctionsAt retail, 3- to 5-year-old truck prices in April registered slightly below March but 35.2% less than April a year ago. For the first four months of 2023, prices are down 28%. An exception is late-model sleepers, which command about 19% more than 2018, the last strong pre-pandemic year. Daycabs are holding their own.Preliminary Class 8 same dealer used truck retail prices fell 22% in April compared to March, according to ACT Research.So, in most instances, it’s a good time to buy a used truck — unless you’ve already surrendered your Department of Transportation authority because spot rates for freight are about $2 per mile less than a year ago, or you cannot qualify for financing in a tight credit market.Depreciation likely will continue for an uncertain period of time.“The only timing being done is trying to predict when depreciation might start to flatten out,” Visser said. “New truck availability hasn’t been a problem for at least two quarters, and the number of trucks on the road has been greater than the freight market demanded for over a year. Depreciation upwards of 6% per month is an oversupplied market.”Typical used truck depreciation is about 2% a month.Related articles:Why the used trucks pricing bubble finally burst‘Once-in-a-lifetime pricing boom’ in used trucks reverses courseFalling used truck prices push largest dealership network to sidelinesClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Used truck prices: What was up has come down, way down appeared first on FreightWaves.]"
268,15984181-b38b-3227-89db-2cad71c9e68a,UPS,2023-05-25,FOCUS-British EV maker Arrival seeks second chance with US EV tax credits,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-british-ev-maker-arrival-060000327.html,1684994400,STORY,"['UBER', 'UPS', 'TSLA']","[By Paul Lienert and Nick CareyDETROIT/BICESTER, England, May 25 (Reuters) - British electric van startup Arrival, which has hit many road bumps in its quest to become the next Tesla Inc, now hopes huge subsidies from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and a second reverse merger will give it a fresh shot at survival.Since it was founded in 2015, Arrival has developed vehicles for high-profile customers like United Parcel Service Inc and Uber Technologies Inc, but has burned through piles of cash without ever hitting mass production and is winding down its UK operations in favor of refocusing on the United States.With the $283 million it should receive from a merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp V, announced in April, executives at Arrival said they will focus on just one U.S.-produced vehicle for now. That vehicle is a larger Class 4, or medium-duty, delivery van that will bring customers a $40,000 IRA subsidy, far above the $7,500 for smaller electric vans.Arrival's new investors are ""very excited about our U.S. product and the U.S. market,"" Chief Financial Officer John Wozniak said. ""There are a lot of tail winds there,"" including a recent California mandate requiring commercial fleets to transition to electric over the next 10 years.Crucially, Arrival says early investor UPS is still an anchor customer - it has ordered up to 10,000 vans - though admittedly not a happy one after waiting years for vehicles.""We continue to evaluate Arrival's decision to refocus its efforts in production and how this may impact potential, future vehicle deployments,"" a UPS spokesperson said.Other EV startups like Rivian Automotive Inc, Lucid Group Inc, Fisker Inc and Lordstown Motors Corp have faced similar challenges, trying to ramp up production while burning through cash at a time when few investors will give them more.But the IRA, which took effect last August, has provided enough of a lifeline to Arrival to attract new investors. It includes customer tax credits for purchases of certain EVs.Story continuesArrival now aims to begin producing its medium-duty XL Van at a ""microfactory"" in Charlotte, North Carolina, by late 2024, and Wozniak said he is confident of hitting that target.The company has so far made three prototypes of its smaller L Van at its Bicester plant in the United Kingdom, which are being road-tested to aid development of the larger, more expensive model.Class 4 vans are more appealing than smaller models ""because the prices and margins are so much higher,"" said Michael Abelson, head of Arrival's North American unit.""The question is, will they have enough cash to actually get into series production?"" said David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham.'ABSOLUTE LIFELINE'At its peak, Arrival was developing two different electric vans and an electric bus. It was also developing a specially designed electric car for Uber drivers.But like other electric startups that collectively raised billions through SPACs, Arrival found that going from concept to mass production is both expensive and immensely difficult.The company projected 2024 revenue of $14 billion in its initial SPAC deal's investor presentation, but Arrival lost a combined $2.3 billion in 2021-2022.To conserve cash, Arrival has cut staff almost 75% to 750 employees. It had just $130 million in cash at the end of the first quarter in an industry where launching a single model can easily cost $1 billion.The startup warned in November it would run out of cash before the end of 2023.Arrival's second SPAC is with Kensington, whose earlier deals brought startups QuantumScape, Amprius and Wallbox to the market.The rare double SPAC is being watched by others in the industry to see if it is worth replicating.An executive with experience running SPACs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kensington's deal was an ""an absolute lifeline"" for a startup in Arrival's situation.""There's no way they would find that kind of money anywhere else,"" the executive said. ""There could be more of this if these guys are able to make it happen.""Reuters contacted all of Arrival's current institutional shareholders, but they either did not respond or declined to comment.'ROOM TO RUN'The IRA is key to making Arrival's turnaround work, which the University of Birmingham's Bailey said was ironic in light of the company's former reputation as the ""great British hope.""""It was seen as Britain's Tesla and yet it's the U.S. government that's essentially supporting it,"" he said.The U.S. medium-duty Class 4 van segment is relatively small, with annual sales of 30,000 to 40,000 vehicles. That is too small for most major manufacturers, so it leaves Arrival with just a few rivals.Those competitors include Shyft Inc, a Michigan-based manufacturer of multi-brand specialty commercial vehicles whose Blue Arc electric vans will go into production this fall.Daimler Trucks' new Rizon brand will start importing electric vans from Japanese affiliate Fuso later this year that qualify for IRA subsidies because of free trade agreements with Japan.California-based startup Xos Inc, which sold just 31 vehicles in the first quarter, is also a competitor.With price tags for medium-duty electric vans targeted to start from around $175,000, the segment represents a potential market worth $5 billion or more.""We think that (Class 4) is a sweet spot where Arrival can make a lot of money,"" CFO Wozniak said. ""We looked across the competitive landscape, and from where you sit today, there's a lot of room to run in that segment.""(Reporting By Paul Lienert in Detroit and Nick Carey in Bicester, England Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)]"

(NYSE:MLM) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Martin Marietta Materials’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials What Is Martin Marietta Materials Worth?Martin Marietta Materials appears to be overvalued by 25% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$397 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $318.81. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like Martin Marietta Materials’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Martin Marietta Materials?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Martin Marietta Materials' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 36%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in MLM’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe MLM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MLM for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for MLM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Martin Marietta Materials as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

270,07926a26-d888-3011-a69f-764b2e6728b6,NTAP,2023-05-25,Analysts Estimate NetApp (NTAP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-netapp-ntap-report-140009881.html,1684936809,STORY,['NTAP'],"[The market expects NetApp (NTAP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.86% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp?For NetApp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NetApp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of $1.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of +4.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NetApp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, accretive acquisitions and significant progress in the company’s restructuring initiatives buoy optimism. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 34.5% as against the industry’s 29.6% plunge.Boston Scientific ended the first quarter of 2023, with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.Geographically, the United States grew 13% year over year operationally, inclusive of a 140 basis-point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable organic strength across each business unit. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 20% on an operational basis, with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth is driven by Boston Scientific’s diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.The company remains excited about the year ahead and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pacific grew 15% operationally, with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. During the first quarter, the company received health sciences authority approval for FARAPULSE in Singapore. In Japan, first-quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon. China also grew in double digits in the first quarter, ahead of the company’s expectations, with solid procedural demand as hospitals work through COVID delayed procedures.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteThe raised 2023 guidance seems bullish, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.Story continuesOn the flip side, continued foreign exchange headwinds largely offset Boston Scientific’s top-line performance. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s revenues reflected a $88 million headwind from foreign exchange with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. On an operational basis, the company’s revenues had a 290-basis point headwind from foreign exchange.Further, Boston Scientific witnessed significant cost pressure. There was an 8.9% rise in the cost of products sold. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.6%, while Research and development expenses rose 5.6%. Considering the industry-wide trend, Boston Scientific continues to expect 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds.Further, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

The company unveiled late-breaking results from the AVEIR dual-chamber (DR) i2i Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study.The study demonstrated that AVEIR DR leadless pacemaker met its three prespecified primary endpoints for safety and performance. The data also noted that this device could provide new benefits for people with slower-than-normal heart rhythms.This favorable outcome has been sent to the FDA as part of Abbott's submission for approval of the AVEIR DR device.More on the NewsThe results were presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the Heart Rhythm Society's (HRS) 44th annual meeting from May 19-21, 2023. The study has also been published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Abbott noted that in the study, primary safety and efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the first 300 people enrolled across 55 centers in the United States, Canada and Europe.  Its three-month post-implant results showed that physicians demonstrated a 98.3% implant success rate. Further, the safety endpoint evaluating freedom from device or procedure complications was achieved. The company also noted that more than 97% of people had successful atrio-ventricular (AV) synchrony.Added to this, in each of the seven different postures and walking speeds, the average AV synchrony was more than 95%. This, according to Abbott, implies that the system will function appropriately during everyday life activities. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere's How AVEIR DR is BetterAccording to Abbott, unlike traditional pacemakers, leadless pacemakers are implanted directly into the heart through a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure. This eliminates the need for cardiac leads and a pulse generator under the skin.The company stated that many people require pacing and sensing in both the right atrium and the right ventricle. However, the currently available leadless pacing options are limited to single-chamber ventricular devices. This is because seamless, wireless synchronization of two leadless pacemakers has been a significant technological challenge.Story continuesFor the vast majority of people, a dual-chamber pacemaker like AVEIR DR will be of great benefit.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global arrhythmia monitoring devices market size is expected to reach $8.41 billion in 2025, with a CAGR of 6.8%. Continuous R&amp;D activities in the field of cardiac monitoring are driving the market.Latest DevelopmentAbbott’s last-reported first quarter of 2023 organic sales, excluding COVID testing, increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China, and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.Within Nutrition, sales increased more than 10%. In the United States, pediatric nutrition growth of more than 35% was driven by favorable year-over-year comparisons (lower sales in the first quarter of 2022 were due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products).Within Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid-to-high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. Despite dull sales in China, Core Lab Diagnostics sales showed year-over-year improvement, driven by strong performance in the United States and Europe.Within Medical Devices, sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the United States and double-digit growth internationally. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens growth internationally.Share Price PerformanceOver the past year, Abbott has been outperforming the industry it belongs to.

The company exited the first quarter of 2023 with a favorable solvent position, generating investors’ optimism.

Chemed projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 8.8% compared with 10.6% of the industry. CHE’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 0.94%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesVITAS Prospects Look Bright: In the first quarter, the VITAS Healthcare business segment’s revenue increase of 3.8% compared to the prior year period – comprising a 3% increase in days of care and a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 2.9%.Additionally, VITAS increased its licensed healthcare staff by 200 professionals (60% of which are licensed nurses) in the first quarter of 2023. Post implementing a targeted hiring and retention wellness initiative in July 2022, VITAS expanded license staffing by 475 professionals.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoto-Rooter Continues to Expand: We are encouraged by Chemed’s Roto-Rooter segment, which delivered revenue growth of 7.9% year over year in the first quarter. Barring residential drain cleaning, the business witnessed continued demand for plumbing, excavation and water restoration services in the quarter under review.Total Roto-Rooter branch commercial revenues rose 10.1% year over year. Total Roto-Rooter branch residential revenues registered growth of 7.5% from the prior-year quarter. Management believes Roto-Rooter is well-positioned for growth post-pandemic and anticipates a continued expansion of the segment’s market share, banking on the company’s core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time and 24/7 call centers and Internet presence.Story continuesStrong Solvency: Chemed is well-capitalized having exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $58.1 million. The total debt at the end of the first quarter was $21 million, much lower than the current-cash level.While exiting the quarter, the company reported short-term payable debt of $5 million.

276,9a501631-31d1-3b4b-ae67-b311d5599442,FTI,2023-05-25,Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Acquisition News From ONEOK and Chevron Take Center Stage,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-gas-stock-roundup-acquisition-122200911.html,1684930920,STORY,"['CVX', 'OKE', 'LNG', 'XOM', 'FTI']","[It was a week when both oil and natural gas prices posted gains.On the news front, the headlines came from midstream firm ONEOK Inc. OKE and energy major Chevron’s CVX acquisition announcements. Developments associated with ExxonMobil XOM, Cheniere Energy LNG and TechnipFMC FTI also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a bullish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 2.2% to close at $71.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices jumped 14.1% to end at $2.59 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).In particular, oil prices climbed on reported progress toward U.S. debt-ceiling resolution though gains were capped by continued recession fears.Meanwhile, natural gas performed even better following a lower-than-expected increase in stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states and the hint of tightening supply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.  ONEOK, a prominent energy infrastructure provider, is set to acquire smaller pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners in a significant cash-and-stock transaction worth $18.8 billion. This deal is expected to create one of the largest oil and natural gas pipeline companies in the United States.The agreement represents a current implied value of $67.50 per unit to each Magellan unitholder, for a 22% premium, based on the May 12, 2023, closing prices. ONEOK's acquisition of MMP marks a significant development in the energy infrastructure industry.The two premier firms have joined forces to create a combined company with a net enterprise value of $60.0 billion. This new midstream giant will have a diversified portfolio of assets across North America and provide services to customers in the energy industry. (ONEOK Buys Magellan for $18.8B, Creates Midstream Giant)2. Chevron recently revealed its plans to acquire upstream company PDC Energy in a transformative all-stock transaction valued at $6.3 billion. According to the terms of the agreement, PDC stockholders will get 0.4638 Chevron shares for every PDC share, for a total enterprise value of $7.6 billion, including debt. This strategic move is expected to strengthen Chevron's position in key U.S. production basins, unlock new opportunities, and drive higher returns for the American multinational firm.In the Denver-Julesburg Basin, PDC Energy offers Chevron a number of benefits, including strong free cash flow, low breakeven production, and development potential close to the company's current operations. The acquisition will provide Chevron with additional acreage in the Permian Basin, bolstering its leading position in one of the world's most prolific oil and gas regions.The transaction is expected to yield several benefits, such as an increase in earnings per share, free cash flow, and return on capital employed. Chevron anticipates the acquisition to be accretive to all key financial measures within the first year after closing and to generate approximately $1 billion in annual free cash flow, based on projected future prices.3. U.S. supermajor ExxonMobil, through its subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. and affiliates, entered into an agreement to divest Williston Basin assets to Chord Energy for $375 million. The transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand, which was $592 million as of Mar 31, 2023.ExxonMobil, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, is expected to have started selling hydrocarbon-containing properties as it seeks to cut down debt by divesting some of its non-core assets. The transaction is expected to be closed by the end of June 2023 and be retroactive from Apr 1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The divested assets involve about 62,000 net acres in Williston Basin within and adjacent to near-term development program. Almost 77% of this is undeveloped. The low-cost, tier-one assets are highly competitive with Chord Energy’s existing portfolio and further extend its inventory runway. (ExxonMobil Signs Deal to Divest Williston Basin Assets)4   A subsidiary of gas exporter Cheniere Energy subsidiary entered into a long-term liquefied natural gas sale and purchase agreement (""SPA"") with Korea Southern Power Co. Ltd (""KOSPO""). This agreement set the stage for a mutually beneficial partnership spanning two decades.Under the terms of the SPA, KOSPO will purchase approximately 0.4 million tons per annum (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas from Cheniere Marketing. Delivery of the same will commence in 2024 and continue until 2046.The long-term nature of the SPA signifies the commitment between Cheniere Energy and KOSPO. The agreement ensures a steady supply of liquefied natural gas to meet KOSPO's energy demands. It also reinforces Cheniere's position as a leading liquefied natural gas provider in the global market. Over the course of the contract, KOSPO will receive approximately 0.4 million tons of LNG annually, contributing to the stability and security of South Korea's energy infrastructure. (Cheniere &amp; Korea Southern Power Sign Long-Term LNG Deal)5.   TechnipFMC, a leading global provider of subsea solutions, secured a contract from Norwegian behemoth Equinor to deliver Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI) services on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This two-year contract (2024-2025) comes with an option for extension over the subsequent three years.Per the agreement, TechnipFMC will deliver production enhancement, data and pre-plug-and-abandonment services to Equinor using the RLWI method. The primary goal is to optimize the performance of Equinor's assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, thereby improving production rates and extending the lifespan of the existing wells.The above-mentioned contract, with a value of $75-$250 million, is expected to contribute to TechnipFMC's inbound orders in the second quarter of 2023. This will further strengthen the company’s market position and reinforce its expertise in providing efficient and cost-effective RLWI services. (TechnipFMC Wins Contract for RLWI Services From Equinor)Story continuesPrice PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last six months.Company    Last Week    Last 6 MonthsXOM               +1.3%               -8.1%CVX                +0.1%              -18%COP               +3.7%              -20.2%OXY                +1.8%              -18.9%SLB                +2.7%              -14.2%RIG                 +1.5%              +54.8%VLO                +0.7%              -20.6%MPC               +1.1%              -12.6%With both oil and natural gas rising for the week, stocks were up too. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — rose 1.4% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has decreased 14.9%.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for guidance on the direction of the commodities. In this context, the U.S. Government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. Currently, news related to the political standoff over the U.S. debt ceiling will be the key factor that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, accretive acquisitions and significant progress in the company’s restructuring initiatives buoy optimism. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 34.5% as against the industry’s 29.6% plunge.Boston Scientific ended the first quarter of 2023, with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.Geographically, the United States grew 13% year over year operationally, inclusive of a 140 basis-point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable organic strength across each business unit. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 20% on an operational basis, with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth is driven by Boston Scientific’s diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.The company remains excited about the year ahead and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pacific grew 15% operationally, with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. During the first quarter, the company received health sciences authority approval for FARAPULSE in Singapore. In Japan, first-quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon. China also grew in double digits in the first quarter, ahead of the company’s expectations, with solid procedural demand as hospitals work through COVID delayed procedures.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteThe raised 2023 guidance seems bullish, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.Story continuesOn the flip side, continued foreign exchange headwinds largely offset Boston Scientific’s top-line performance. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s revenues reflected a $88 million headwind from foreign exchange with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. On an operational basis, the company’s revenues had a 290-basis point headwind from foreign exchange.Further, Boston Scientific witnessed significant cost pressure. There was an 8.9% rise in the cost of products sold. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.6%, while Research and development expenses rose 5.6%. Considering the industry-wide trend, Boston Scientific continues to expect 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds.Further, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

The company’s Price/Sales ratio of 0.8 compares favorably with the industry’s 3.9.Accuray is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and strategic partnerships are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding stiff competition and overdependence on technologies persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversSolid Product Portfolio: Accuray’s solid product portfolio raises investors’ optimism. On the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in November 2022, the company confirmed its launch of VitalHold, which resulted from its partnership with C-RAD, at the ASTRO show in San Antonio, TX.On the same call, Accuray confirmed that it had also demonstrated its newest innovation, ARTemis, the online adaptive capability in partnership with RaySearch, at the ASTRO show.Strategic Partnerships: Investors are optimistic about Accuray’s slew of partnerships over the past few months. On the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in April, Accuray’s management confirmed that the company’s partnership with GE Healthcare continues to advance on multiple commercial fronts.On the second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in February, the company confirmed that it had advanced key strategic partnerships, most recently with C-RAD, introducing the VitalHold breast package that will allow Accuray to offer the most comprehensive breast package in the market.Strong Q3 Results: Accuray’s robust third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded solid overall top-line and bottom-line performances in the quarter. Robust Product and Services revenues and geographical performances were also witnessed. Accuray also registered continued strong demand for its Clear RT and Synchrony on Radixact and the CyberKnife S7.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on Technologies: Achieving consumer and third-party payor acceptance of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms as preferred methods of tumor treatment is crucial to Accuray’s continued success. Physicians will not begin to use or increase the use of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data and other factors, that the two platforms are safe and effective alternatives to traditional treatment methods.Stiff Competition: The medical device industry and the non-invasive cancer treatment field, in particular, are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. To compete successfully, Accuray will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of its products and technologies over well-established alternative procedures, and other counterparts and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of the same.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

(Photo: Shutterstock/Andy Borysowski)Norfolk Southern and the heads of 12 unions have pledged to work together to improve safety, sending a letter to all craft and management employees describing the renewed partnership.The letter, signed by NS President and CEO Alan Shaw and the presidents of the 12 unions, comes as NS (NYSE: NSC) and other Class I railroads face federal scrutiny over railroad safety. A Feb. 3 derailment of an NS train in East Palestine, Ohio, brought a national spotlight on the issue of rail safety, with federal regulators and industry stakeholders following the accident seeking to define whether and how rail safety should be better addressed.The letter calls for the company to “do better” through more collaboration, a review of best practices, employee input and consultation with experts, according to NS’ Tuesday news release.“Protecting the safety of workers is one of the founding values of labor unions, and union leadership advocates tenaciously on behalf of the safety and wellbeing of our people,” the letter said. “Management at Norfolk Southern shares that deeply held value, and invests time, energy, and resources to provide our people with the training, equipment, and technology to support safe operations.”It continued, “We won’t agree on everything. That’s okay. Our belief in the importance of safety unites us. We want our people to show up to work every day knowing their employer and their union are working diligently to help them do their jobs safely.”The union national presidents that signed the letter were those representing the American Train Dispatchers Association; Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen; Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes; Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division; and Transportation Communications Union.Shopcraft unions signing the letter were Brotherhood of Railway Carmen; International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Mechanical Division; International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers; and Transport Workers Union.Story continuesIn an unrelated event this week, an attorney representing seven rail unions sent testimony to the Surface Transportation Board that sought to bolster the argument that sufficient head count at the Class I railroads can enable the railroads to provide improved service. That testimony also called on STB to revise the common carrier obligation.Another union calls for passage of a congressional rail safety billAs NS and union leaders expressed a renewed partnership to improve rail safety, the president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers called for U.S. senators to vote in favor of rail safety legislation that recently passed the Senate Commerce Committee.IAM International President Robert Martinez Jr. said the Railway Safety Act not only calls for safety improvements but also work-life improvements for railroad carmen and machinists.“For our members specifically, the bill prohibits the railroads from placing impossible time constraints on rail car and locomotive inspectors. … The bill would also require more frequent locomotive and rail car safety inspections, while ensuring that these inspections are performed as intended and by highly trained and qualified personnel,” Martinez said.IAM says its members include locomotive machinists as well as members from affiliate unions, the Transportation Communications Union and the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Unions tell regulators that Class I railroads’ hiring efforts are misleadingUnion group pushes for passage of rail safety billRail safety bill passes Senate committee amid GOP resistanceThe post Norfolk Southern and rail union presidents renew safety commitment appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 10 Most LGBTQ-Friendly Countries in the World.Economic Costs of LGBTQ ExclusionHomophobia and anti-LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) laws are costing the economy billions of dollars worldwide. North Carolina alone suffers from $3.76 billion in lost businesses due to limitations in LGBT+ protection laws; $31 billion are lost in India, while the rest of the economy shares similar figures.According to the LGBT+ Pride 2021 Global Survey, 4% of Generation Z, 2% of Millennials, 1% of Generation X, and less than 1% of Baby Boomers identify themselves as non-binary, gender-fluid, non-confirming, transgender, or in a way that is other than male or female. Visibility of these non-binary individuals is low, albeit growing at a significant pace since the past decade.A conservative estimate on efforts to change the sexual orientation and gender identities states that the U.S. is losing out more than $9 billion each year. At least 700,000 LGBT adults have been subject to conversion therapies at some point in their lives for gender affirmation. Gender dysphoria, on the other hand, has led more than 80% of non-binary and trans youth to consider suicide, according to data from the US. Economies around the world are losing out on human capital and future economic developments due to the exclusion of the LGBTQ+ community.In fact, Open for Business, a global companies’ coalition formed to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion, notes that more inclusive cities tend to have a higher GDP per capita. Their global ranking based on 500 cities confirms that the most innovative cities in the world, such as London, New York, Toronto, Paris, and even Vienna are more so because they are more LGBTQ-inclusive. Companies that have anti-discrimination laws against sexual orientation and gender identity report greater levels of innovation too.Story continuesFurthermore, a survey of 60,000 corporations reveals that inclusive companies register 8% more patents and receive 11% more patent citations comparatively. On the other hand, economies that tend to be anti-LGBTQ+ drive talent away from them and suffer from ""brain drain."" Even a one-standard deviation rise stemming from city immigrant diversity has been associated with a 5.8% rise in productivity, implying the same for economies which attract such talent towards them.Open for Business, and Euro News further discover that economies can raise their levels of Foreign Direct Investment 4.5 times by creating an all-inclusive community. This is because international workforce and investments are generally directed towards countries that are more ""tolerant"" and ""inclusive."" Societal acceptance of homosexuality positively correlates with inward FDI flows when correlating PEW Global Attitudes Survey with Foreign Direct Investment data.LGBT and Business PerformanceProud Ventures reveals that at least 75% of LGBT founders, along with 79% of investors, hide their sexual orientation and/or identity to avoid discrimination. A report on the economic opportunity for the LGBTQ+ community states that 32% of LGBT individuals have an income of less than $24,000. 44% are either unemployed or under-employed, while they are six times more likely to suffer from food shortages. This community is also more likely to face homelessness as a result of discriminatory behavior demonstrated by governments and the public alike.Consequently, many businesses are embracing equality in the workspace, as reported by Boston Consulting Group. As such, these companies are in a better position to benefit from the increasing spending power of LGBT+ consumers. As of 2019, LGBT capital notes that the purchasing power of this community stood at $3.9 trillion globally.A Credit Suisse study further notes that companies who have open memberships to LGBT+ business networks or were LGBT-leading companies had better performances in global stocks and benchmarks. Since 2010, the LGBT index has outperformed MSCI AWCI by 3%.In this context, many top-rated companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and even Walt Disney have openly pledged support to sexual minorities. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been donating more than $1.2 million to LGBT organizations from around the world. Meanwhile, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) regularly donate to such communities and even support same-sex marriages. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) has even released Pride Watch  to support the work of LGBT organizations. LGBT-inclusive spaces can also be found on Google Maps and Search, a feature released by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Similarly, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been praised for its anti-discriminatory policies for this community.At least 67 countries, primarily developing economies, have laws that criminalize same-sex marriages and certain forms of gender expression. These countries have their own views and beliefs strongly upheld by most of the population. As such, minority communities can better thrive in more LGBT-friendly countries.25 Most LGBTQ-Friendly Countries in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn order to compile the list of the 25 most LGBT-friendly countries in the world, we have adopted the LGBT Equality Index by Equaldex. It combines the scores based on the legal rights and freedoms of people as well as how the general public feels about LGBTQ+ community in each country.Countries are then ranked in ascending order of high scores on their equality index.

Chile is the 31st country to do so, and the public is generally accepting of the community. 2019 also saw the passing of a comprehensive legal gender recognition laws, and a third sex option is also available for intersex children on birth certificates.17.

Civil unions for same-sex couples have been legalized since 2014; the general public seems tolerant of the community. As a result, more such people are coming out knowing they can associate freely with other citizens.15. ArgentinaEquality Score: 82LGBT+ rights in Argentina are some of the most prominent and comprehensive in the world.

288,2eaae314-92be-3066-9392-871b0926aff8,KO,2023-05-25,Coke (KO) Down 3.8% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coke-ko-down-3-8-153013572.html,1684942213,STORY,['KO'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Coca-Cola (KO). Shares have lost about 3.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Coke due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Coca-Cola Q1 Sales &amp; Earnings Beat, Retains ViewCoca-Cola has reported better-than-expected top and bottom-line results for first-quarter 2023. Earnings and sales also improved year over year and surpassed our estimate in the quarter. The company’s results have benefited from its continued business momentum. KO reiterated its view for 2023.Comparable earnings of 68 cents per share grew 5% from the year-ago period and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. Meanwhile, comparable earnings surpassed our estimate of 64 cents. However, unfavorable currency translations hurt comparable earnings by 7 percentage points. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rose 13% year over year.Revenues of $10,980 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,853 million and improved 5% year over year. Revenues also beat our estimate of $10,681.6 million. Organic revenues rose 12% from the prior-year quarter. Coca-Cola’s top line benefited from strong revenue growth most across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales. In the reported quarter, Coca-Cola gained a global value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.Volume and PricingIn the reported quarter, concentrate sales rose 1% year over year, while the price/mix rose 11%. The price/mix benefited from pricing actions in the marketplace, coupled with a favorable channel and package mix. In the quarter, concentrate sales were 2 points lower than unit case volume due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impacts of one less day in the quarter.Coca-Cola’s total unit case volume rose 3% in the first quarter. The company’s ongoing investments in the marketplace and strength in the away-from-home channel aided the unit case volume. The volume for the developed markets improved in the mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by growth in Mexico, Western Europe and Australia. Meanwhile, the developing and emerging markets rose in the low-single digits. Growth in developing and emerging markets was driven by China, India and Brazil, offset by the suspension of its business in Russia.Coming to the category cluster performance, volume grew 3% for sparkling soft drinks, driven by 3% growth for the trademark Coca-Cola, 8% growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and a 3% gain in sparkling flavors. The sparkling soft drinks category benefited from the strong performances in Latin America and the Asia Pacific, offset by the suspension of its business in Russia.Volume for juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even in the first quarter. Strong growth in fairlife in the United States, Minute Maid Pulpy in China and Maaza in India were largely offset by the suspension of the business in Russia.The water, sports, coffee and tea category moved up 4% in the first quarter. Coca-Cola witnessed 5% growth in the water category, driven by gains in the Asia Pacific and Latin America. Sports drinks dipped 1% due to declines in BODYARMOR and Powerade in the United States. Tea volume was down 3% due to softness in dogadan in Turkiye. The coffee business witnessed 9% growth on strong Costa coffee performances in the U.K. and China.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues rose 14% for Latin America, 9% for North America and 10% for EMEA, while the same declined 3% each for the Asia Pacific and Global Ventures, and 5% for Bottling Investments. Organic revenues improved 23% in EMEA, 19% in Latin America, 9% in North America, 3% in the Asia Pacific, 5% in Global Ventures and 11% in Bottling Investments.MarginsIn dollar terms, the operating income dipped 1% year over year to $3,367 million, including an 8-point impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating income rose 5.6% year over year.Comparable currency-neutral operating income advanced 15% on strong organic revenue growth across all segments, offset by higher operating costs and marketing investments.The operating margin of 30.7% in the first quarter contracted 180 basis points (bps) from 32.5% in the prior-year quarter. The comparable operating margin expanded 40 bps to 31.8%, driven by higher operating revenues and the gains of refranchising bottling operations, offset by higher operating costs, elevated marketing investments and currency headwinds.GuidanceManagement has reiterated its view for 2023. It anticipates organic revenue growth of 7-8% for 2023. Comparable revenues are expected to be impacted by a 2-3% currency headwind based on current rates. The guidance includes a 1% negative impact of acquisition and divestiture.The company expects an impact of a mid-single-digit percentage from commodity price inflation on comparable cost of goods sold. It anticipates an underlying effective tax rate of 19.5% for 2023.Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share are estimated to increase 7-9%. The company anticipates year-over-year comparable earnings per share growth of 4-5%. Its comparable earnings per share growth is likely to include a headwind of 3-4% from currency and a slight headwind from acquisitions and divestitures.For second-quarter 2023, comparable revenues are expected to include a 3-4% currency headwind and a 1% negative impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. Comparable earnings per share are estimated to include a currency headwind of 2-3%.Management envisions an adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion for 2023, including $11.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditure is likely to be $1.9 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Coke has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Coke has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This rise was driven by the solid growth in customers for QuickBooks Online, a favorable mix-shift and the addition of Mailchimp.Total Online Ecosystem revenues grew 23% year over year to $1.47 billion. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenues were up 25% year over year to $723 million, mainly driven by the mix-shift, higher pricing and customer growth.Intuit Inc.

QuoteOnline Services revenues which include payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 21% year over year to $745 million. This was driven by strong performances of Mailchimp, QuickBooks Online payroll and QuickBooks Online payments solutions.Within QuickBooks Online payroll, a mix-shift to INTU’s full-service offering and the continued uptick in the customer base acted as tailwinds. Within QuickBooks Online payments, an increase in the charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth drove revenues.Total international online revenues increased 12% year over year on a constant-currency basis.Total Desktop ecosystem revenues grew 16.4% year over year during the reported quarter to $553 million.In the fiscal third quarter, revenues from Consumer Group increased to $3.34 billion from $3.24 billion reported a year ago, mainly driven by a strong peak in new customers and extension filers.

Seana, we were talking about this earlier about what this means for the consumer. We sort of try to glean information from any number of these retailers.In the case of Kohl's, it does point to that value play. We keep hearing over and over, consumers looking for some value, especially as they get squeezed. The inventory thing we're talking about, yes, that led to an average ticket decline because they did have heavy discounts, but the company also said they saw increased foot traffic, and customers were buying more items. So that suggests that in a good value, even in this environment, customers are looking to buy here, but it's got to be at the right price point. And that's kind of where Kohl's is looking for.SEANA SMITH: Kohl's does have the advantage when it comes to that price point, given the fact that they are viewed as a value play. But I think the big question going forward is how much people, how much consumers are going to be spending on discretionary purchases. And that's something that Kohl's really relies on when it comes to retail, not necessarily some of those necessity purchases that we have seen at some of the other larger retailers, like Walmart, which is also a value play, but better positioned, given the reliance or given the fact that their grocery division makes up such a large part of their revenue.But Kohl's saying that they are positioned OK among those value play department store names here. Over the last year, this company has been under tremendous amount of pressure with shares off just about 40%. So the new CEO there, Tom Kingsbury, certainly making some progress since he took over in February, but a ways to go in order to get shareholders back on board.Story continuesAnother play that we're looking at here, Abercrombie. Shares surging today, closing up just over 30% after the fashion retailer posted stronger than expected first quarter profit, boosted its annual outlook here when you take a look at some of the comments here on the earnings call from the CEO saying that the company has raised prices by double digits since the pandemic. They've done that for both of their brands, so both Abercrombie and Hollister there, Akiko. And she said that it's obviously a good move here from the retailer because consumers have shown that they're willing to pay those higher prices.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, the Abercrombie store is in a better position than their Hollister stores. They did talk about some of the challenges, especially with the teen consumer. But you're certainly right about where they are positioned right now. We were having this conversation this morning, Seana, about where Abercrombie is right now and how they've been able to transform their brand, change the image from where we remember it to be more than 10 years ago, and then bring these consumers on board even in a time of inflation. So that certainly points to the strength of the brand and the strategy for the company.Inventory, another thing we were talking about earlier today, it's pulling back significantly from where it was last year. And I thought you brought up a good point here. It is fascinating to think a year ago, we were talking about the inventory and just the pile-up that we were seeing, especially in freight. It took that long to clear some of this inventory. We're still seeing discounts that are being had there. But in the case of Abercrombie, they have seen a significant improvement on that front.Let's move on here to Intuit shares falling today after its tax season revenue fell shy of estimates on fewer than anticipated filings. In the company's earnings call, CEO Goodarzi said it's possible the government run tax filing system will cost taxpayers billions. And you see the stock getting hit about 7 and 1/2% there. The big question for me, Seana, when you think about a company like Intuit, what it means if the government does move forward with their e-filing, because that's where they get a bulk of their revenue, things like TurboTax, there's a lot of questions there about what it means for the company moving forward.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, it could be a massive challenge here for Intuit, given the fact that they're already looking at lower volumes for their most recent quarter. They reported lower volumes than the Street was expecting, so another challenge here going forward or another potential headwind, obviously, something that shareholders are taking a little bit of issue with.One thing, though, that Intuit did use to its advantage when speaking about some of those lower volumes, they were able to balance that risk here with better pricing. So that's something that was able to cushion some of the blow that the company did see over its most recent earnings report. But again, that trend here is a little bit concerning.One other highlight that I want to point out, though, when it comes to that better pricing, also small business and self-employed segment, that was coming in better than expected, better than what the Street was forecasting. 24% growth here in terms of that outlook, up from 19% to 20%, so incrementally better there. But again, I think the big question is down the line, what exactly that e-filing here for the government, what that would do to Intuit's business.]"

Shares have added about 0.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Whirlpool due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Whirlpool Q1 Earnings and Sales Surpass EstimatesWhirlpool posted first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and net sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics declined year over year. Results were impacted by the global demand softness, and an unfavorable mix of product and price.Insight Into Q1The appliance maker reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.66 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 and our estimate of $2.48. However, the bottom line declined 49.9% from the $5.31 reported in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $4,649 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,550 million and our estimate of $4,533 million. However, the top line dropped 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $4,736 million, down 3.7% year over year. The downside is mainly due to unfavorable product price/mix &amp; soft global demands.The gross profit for first-quarter 2023 was $763 million, down 10.3% from $851 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Ongoing EBIT of $251 million declined 45.8% from $463 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 5.4% contracted 400 basis points (bps) year over year.Regional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 1.6% year over year to $2,747 million. The segment’s EBIT plunged 39.6% year over year to $454 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 630 bps to 10% due to unfavorable price/mix partially offset by the addition of InSinkErator.Net sales for the EMEA segment were down 18% year over year to $889 million. Organic sales in the region dipped 7.7%. The metric was hurt by drab demand in key countries. The segment’s EBIT was at $5 million against the year-ago quarter’s loss of $27 million. This increase was driven by positive price/mix and held for sale benefits partially offset by raw material inflation.Net sales from Latin America dipped 0.4% year over year to $757 million, owing to softer demand in Brazil partially offset by sequential demand improvement in Mexico and cost-based pricing actions. The segment’s EBIT of $39 million declined 27.8% compared with the year-ago period’s $54 million. The EBIT margin contracted 190 bps to 5.2%, mainly affected by cost inflation and foreign currency.Net sales in Asia fell 10.2% year over year to $256 million mainly due to muted consumer demand. Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 3.4%. The segment’s EBIT of $8 million reflected a 62.9% plunge from the $14 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 3.1% contracted 170 bps from the prior-year quarter due to negative price/mix and foreign currency partially offset by reduced cost inflation.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsAs of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,359 million, long-term debt of $7,382 million and a stockholders’ equity of $2,061 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $173 million.As of Mar 31, 2023, Whirlpool used cash of $477 million from operating activities. It reported a free cash outflow of $573 million. WHR incurred a capital expenditure of $96 million in the same period.The company returned $97 million in cash to shareholders as dividends. As of Mar 31, 2023, it has approximately $2.6 billion remaining as share repurchase authorization.OutlookWhirlpool reaffirmed its expectations for 2023 net sales of $19.4 billion, down 1-2% from the prior year’s reported number. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool downgraded its earnings per share expectation to $13-$15 from the previous expectation of $16-$18. However, it reaffirmed ongoing earnings per diluted share of $16-$18. Management anticipates a tax rate of 19-21% on a GAAP basis and adjusted basis. For 2023, Whirlpool expects cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion and a free cash flow of $800 million.That said, management is on track with its cost takeout actions and expects $800 to $900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.5% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Whirlpool has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Whirlpool has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fears of a recession at the end of this year have been looming large, further making market participants jittery.The Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points in its May meeting to a range of 5-5.25%. Inflation, on the other hand, has started signs of easing lately, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 4.9% year over year in April compared with a 5% rise in March. This is the lowest annual rate since April 2021.Impressive inflation data has raised hopes that the Fed might finally halt its interest rate hikes, which could begin as early as in June when the central bank officials meet for its two-day policy meeting.However, investors are yet to get a clear picture of the Fed’s future course of action as officials in its May meeting said that it would make a decision based on the data that comes in. Although inflation has started showing signs of easing, it’s still a lot higher than the Fed’s target level of 2%.The U.S. economy has been slowing as multi-year-high interest rates continue to cripple industries. U.S. GDP grew a moderate 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the consensus estimate of 2% growth.The manufacturing sector has largely been impacted by rising rates, which is taking its toll on the economy. Although the ISM manufacturing PMI improved to 47.1 in April, the sector has been contracting for several months. In fact, the manufacturing sector declined to a three-year low in April, which speaks a lot about the economy’s health.Stocks in FocusGiven this situation, betting on dividend-paying stocks would be a wise decision. Dividend stocks with a solid business plan and a proven track record are known for handling market volatility. An astute investor should thus consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are LyondellBasell Industries N.V. LYB, AAON, Inc. AAON, SL Green Realty Corp.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli. During his appearance on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' on May 5, Mario Gabelli, the billionaire CEO of GAMCO Investors, acknowledged that he identifies himself as a long-term value investor. Rather than solely considering company fundamentals, he emphasizes a broader perspective. Gabelli praised Warren Buffett's strategy in the financial sector, noting that Buffett tends to prefer investing in insurance companies over banks due to the volatility and risk associated with bank failures and subsequent financial losses. He also strongly criticized the mishandling that resulted in the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. On the other hand, Mario Gabelli noted that the long-term health of businesses seems healthy based on cash flow, reduced double ordering, and inventories coming down. However, in the short-term, these companies are facing staggering interest rates on borrowing.  Mario Gabelli, in an interview with Markets Insider on April 4, warned that American investors could potentially encounter a recession in the near future. He also expressed concerns about potential stock market declines, a decrease in house prices, and the lingering effects of the banking crisis. The billionaire told Markets Insider: ""I see an economic slowdown in the second half of 2023, probably a recession.""Nonetheless, Gabelli forecasted that the downturn wouldn't be overly severe due to anticipated federal infrastructure initiatives and increased government spending in preparation for the upcoming presidential election. These measures are expected to boost demand. Additionally, Gabelli pointed out that companies relocating their operations back to the country and the recovery of countries like China could help mitigate the effects of the economic slowdown. He further said: Story continues""The Fed is unlikely to bend at the moment. They'll stay the course and raise rates.""As per Markets Insider, Gabelli emphasized the potential danger of a credit crunch that could arise if customers continue to transfer their deposits from smaller banks to larger ones or money-market funds. He also highlighted the possibility of lenders becoming more cautious and scaling back their lending activities due to concerns about potential bank runs. Gabelli noted that tighter financing conditions could have a significant impact on the housing and commercial real estate sectors, as both heavily rely on loans for their operations.In this article, we discuss the 10 newest value stocks that billionaire Mario Gabelli added to his Q1 2023 portfolio. Among these additions are Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR), and Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX).

However, they trimmed the estimates for fiscal year 2024 by approximately 2%-3%.

(NYSE:CAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“In the case of Caterpillar Inc.

Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”9. Titan International, Inc. (NYSE:TWI)Stake Value of GAMCO Investors: $524,000Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Titan International, Inc. (NYSE:TWI) engages in the production and distribution of wheels, tires, undercarriage systems, and related components for off-highway vehicles.

(NYSE:TOL), with collective stakes worth $882.2 million. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates held the largest position in the company, comprising 5.3 million shares worth $321 million. Baron Funds made the following comment about Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share. Historically, Toll Brothers’ shares have been valued, on average, at 1.4 times book value and a peak multiple of approximately 2.0 times tangible book value. If the shares recover in the next few years and trade only to the company’s long-term average multiple of 1.4 times book value, Toll Brothers’ share price would increase 82% to $91 per share.”7.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) as a global leader in healthcare diagnostics, imaging, and intervention, emphasizing its extensive range of products in areas such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasound, services, and digital solutions. The analyst believes that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC)’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 22 times is lower than the average applied to large-cap medical technology companies, but considers this valuation appropriate given the current stage of GE Healthcare's development as an independent entity.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 37 hedge funds were bullish on GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), up from 8 funds in the prior quarter. Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM), Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE: UNVR), and Garrett Motion Inc.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) is one of the top value stocks in Mario Gabelli’s Q1 portfolio.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We sold GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) during the quarter. GE HealthCare is a recent spin-off from General Electric Company and provides imaging, ultrasound, patient care solutions and pharmaceutical diagnostics to customers around the world. The company is a leader in a global oligopoly and has a massive installed base. Half of the company’s revenue is recurring, margins are stable to rising, and it generates significant free cash flow. As a recent operating unit inside of GE, we believe the market has been undervaluing this asset. Although the spin price reflected this under-valuation, after the spin-off, its stock price rose to meet our estimate of its intrinsic value, and we sold the position. GE HealthCare remains on our MVP list.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli.  Suggested articles:11 Stocks with Heavy Insider Buying20 Poorest Countries in Asia10 Best Small Cap Bank Stocks With Dividends Disclosure: None. 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario Gabelli is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is the total amount the U.S. government is allowed to borrow to finance its expenditure, such as paying salaries and welfare allowances. On Jan 19, the United States hit its debt ceiling limit of $31.4 trillion, leading to a standoff between the White House and Congress over how to raise or suspend the limit, per a Reuters article. A continued impasse related to the debt-ceiling crisis will impact all sectors. The medical companies may face challenges as government healthcare spending may get reduced or halted without a resolution.Probable Impact of the CrisisU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the country could default on its debt as early as Jun 1, 2023 if the impasse is not resolved. A default would mean that the United States would fail to pay its creditors, such as foreign governments and investors, who hold U.S. Treasury bonds. This could trigger a financial crisis that would have a ripple effect across the world, impacting markets, trade and currencies. A potential default will also have significant implication for the healthcare industry, with the government focusing more on repaying its debt than healthcare-related spending. The default may also impact Social Security and unemployment insurance benefits, leading to lower or delayed medical expenses by patients.Factors Causing High DebtThe debt-ceiling crisis is part of an ongoing political debate within Congress about federal government spending and the national debt that the U.S. government accrues. The United States has had large budget deficits for years, meaning that it spends more than it collects in taxes. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government brought in $4.90 trillion but spent $6.27 trillion, with a net budget deficit of $1.38 trillion (the fourth highest of the 21st century).Story continuesThe main drivers of federal spending are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Other expenses of the government comprise discretionary spending, which also includes defense. A portion of the budget is also spent on paying interest on the debt, which is expected to rise further as debt grows.Here we discuss three medical stocks that may be potentially impacted by the crisis going forward:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth Group UNH is the largest health insurer in the United States, serving more than 150 million customers through its various plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. A default may result in a potential disruption in UNH’s revenue stream and cash flow. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have declined 9.6% so far this year.HCA Healthcare HCA, the largest for-profit hospital operator in the United States, owns and operates 186 hospitals and 121 freestanding surgery centers across 20 states and the United Kingdom. HCA could get delayed payments from Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 40% of its net revenues in case of a default. Shares of HCA Healthcare have gained 11.6% so far this year.Pfizer PFE, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, produces and sells a wide range of drugs and vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. A default may affect PFE’s ability to collect payments from government agencies and programs, such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration. Shares of Pfizer have lost 22.6% so far this year.UnitedHealth Group, HCA Healthcare and Pfizer all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Debt Ceiling HistoryPer a Reuters article, the United States has raised its debt ceiling 78 times since 1960, usually without much controversy. However, in recent years, some lawmakers have used the debt ceiling as a leverage point to demand spending cuts or policy changes from the opposing party. This resulted in several near-default situations and government shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2019.Current ScenarioIn the current impasse, Republicans have proposed cutting spending back to 2022 levels as a precondition to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats have insisted on a ""clean bill"" without preconditions, as had been the case in raising the ceiling three times during the Trump administration.President Joe Biden has urged Congress to act swiftly and responsibly to avoid a default that would harm millions of Americans and damage the country's reputation and creditworthiness. He has also ruled out invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which some legal scholars argue gives him the authority to bypass Congress and raise the debt limit unilaterally. Biden has said he does not want to create a constitutional crisis over a fiscal one.As the deadline approaches, both sides are under pressure to reach a compromise or face the consequences of a historic default that could plunge the world into a new recession.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

312,b106b496-0f90-3be9-8f0a-c394a39490f0,UNH,2023-05-25,Companies like CVS and UnitedHealth are now some of the world’s biggest businesses. Is that healthy for the rest of us?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-cvs-unitedhealth-now-world-103000187.html,1684924200,STORY,"['CVS', 'UNH']","[In April, the corporate behemoth that started life as the Consumer Value Store celebrated its 60th birthday with a costume party. Karen Lynch, the CEO of what is now CVS Health, asked her top executives to attend a town hall dressed in 1960s fashion. Some opted for tie-dye, some opted out. Lynch herself enthusiastically embraced the brief, donning the white go-go boots and pillbox hat of a Mad Men–era flight attendant.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home But while Lynch was cosplaying as a woman with little professional power, she was celebrating the latest acquisition in her career as a health care mogul. She joined CVS in 2018 when the pharmacy chain paid $70 billion to buy Aetna, the insurance giant that now covers about 37 million Americans. Since becoming CEO of the combined company in 2021, Lynch has spent another $19 billion on primary care and home health care businesses, betting that CVS can profit by directly owning doctors’ groups.By her side at that birthday party was Mike Pykosz, CEO of primary care company Oak Street Health. The Chicago-based business specializes in treating Medicare-eligible—and thus highly profitable—patients; Lynch was in the process of bringing Oak Street and its 600 physicians and other providers under CVS’s ever-expanding umbrella. A few weeks later, CVS closed the deal. And Lynch saw the number of people whose health and lives are affected by her decisions expand again, to more than 110 million.“I always think, sitting in this chair, ‘How would I want to be treated? How would I want my family members to be treated?’ ” Lynch tells Fortune, reflecting on CVS’s influence eight days after her Oak Street purchase closed. “You’re not going to get it right all the time,” she acknowledges. “But how do we get better?”Story continuesThe business answer to those questions—for CVS, and for its entire industry—has been to get relentlessly bigger. Over the past two decades, Lynch’s onetime drugstore has snapped up storefront medical clinics; Caremark, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager (or PBM); Aetna, the nation’s third-largest insurer; and now two new care businesses.CVS is jockeying for these deals with a wide array of competitors, in health care and beyond. Rival mega-pharmacy Walgreens has invested billions of dollars in primary care clinic VillageMD and urgent-care operator Summit Health. Amazon just spent $3.9 billion on One Medical and its 200 doctors’ offices. Cigna bought PBM ExpressScripts for $67 billion in 2018. Health care groups and hospitals have been consolidating for years, and deep-pocketed private equity investors are snapping up providers of all kinds. All of this activity is taking place in the long shadow of UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the nation’s largest insurer and largest employer of doctors. With $324 billion in 2022 revenue, it’s also larger by a smidgen than CVS. It has spent the past decade building Optum, its highly profitable health services juggernaut, whose businesses span from home health to surgical centers to claims processing tools, and cater to the entire industry, competitors included. (Optum’s model is now the go-to playbook for huge insurers: Elevance Health and Humana have both formed similar units.) Nor does UHG plan to stop expanding anytime soon. “Despite our size, we’re just scratching the surface of the opportunity,” CEO Andrew Witty told an investor conference audience in November.“UnitedHealth has an entire ecosystem—and that’s what CVS and others are trying to replicate,” says Lisa Gill, head of health care services research at J.P. Morgan. The ultimate goal, she adds, is for each company to meet each patient’s every medical need—and “have the ability to drive them to the lowest-cost, best-outcome, most convenient care.”That goal resonates—especially after COVID, which made every American that much more aware of the flaws in our health care system. Everyone knows that system is broken. It’s ludicrously expensive: Health care spending reached $4.3 trillion in 2021, or $13,000 per person—almost a fifth (18.3%) of U.S. GDP. The costs are untenable for both individuals and their employers who provide insurance. And in the absence of Medicare for all, it has provided a broad opening for UHG, CVS, and their rivals to chase scale and profits in the name of building something better.“Our growth has allowed us access to more of these capabilities,” says Dr. Margaret-Mary Wilson, UHG’s chief medical officer. She says the strategy is not about a pile of “flashy acquisitions” but about “bringing the pieces together to help drive value.”Health care executives, investors, and some practitioners argue that this “vertical integration”—marrying primary care clinics and physicians’ practices to insurance, pharmacy benefit management, data analytics, and a host of related businesses—is, or will be, good for everyone. Companies can deliver care more efficiently and conveniently, providing more services to lower-income patients and other underserved populations, and heading off the chronic conditions and serious illnesses that drive up costs.Insurers, accustomed to thinking in terms of cost control, say that they’re the right companies to run this new model. The hope is that a grateful nation will benefit both physically and financially and reward these companies with more business—creating the ultimate virtuous cycle.As the industry embraces what it calls “value-based care,” the vision is a patient experience that involves seeing doctors and other providers early and often, in settings closer to (or sometimes even in) their homes. These low-stress, tech-enabled relationships will provide quick intervention, disease management, and wellness counseling, with the aim of preventing ER visits and hospitalizations. The biggest companies say that by rapidly growing, they can assemble the pieces to realize this vision. Well, the growth is happening. Health care companies dominate business like never before: On the most recent Fortune 500 list, the industry accounted for eight of the top 25 largest U.S. companies by revenue. CVS and UnitedHealth earned 162% and 193% more revenue, respectively, in 2022 than they did in 2012. (CVS is also a sponsor of Fortune conferences and the Fortune Well health news site.) Cigna and Elevance grew by 520% and 154%, respectively.But the broader benefits are, so far, a matter of debate—and the focus of much skepticism among doctors, patients, lawmakers, and industry critics. “Everything about the incentive structure that exists, when you have providers and insurers and pharmacy benefit managers coming together under one roof, to me spells ‘conflict of interest,’ ” says Sara Sirota, a policy analyst at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit focused on antitrust advocacy. “That’s going to harm services and prices for patients.”The health care giants point to early signs of improvement, and promise even bigger benefits further down the road. In the meantime, they keep growing at a blistering pace. Which means it’s more urgent than ever to ask: Who benefits from Big Health Care’s growth—and will it really make America healthier?Back in 2007, Southwest Medical Associates was practically an asterisk in news coverage of UnitedHealth Group’s $2.6 billion merger with Sierra Health Services, a Nevada-based insurer (and Southwest’s parent). That UHG was picking up a multispecialty practice that employed 250 providers appeared of little consequence compared with the company’s insurance gains—including a fatter tap into Nevada’s pool of Medicare-eligible retirees.But with Southwest, UHG was beginning a far larger project than perhaps anyone appreciated, embarking on a journey to radical, next-level Bigness—with a propulsive strategy to not just manage payments for health care, but to deliver care, too.UHG has since amassed a workforce of some 70,000 physicians and an untold number of advanced practice clinicians that work for Optum Health. That business complements two others—pharmacy benefit management (OptumRx) and data services (Optum Insight)—that now constitute Optum, the company’s $186 billion health services division. Optum has been bolstered by a series of audacious deals (see the below graphic), and analysts muse about it one day dwarfing UnitedHealthcare (UHC), UHG’s bread-and-butter insurance business.Impressively, in building this many-tentacled colossus, UHG has turned many of its competitors into customers, forging complex relationships across the health ecosystem: UHC’s insurer rivals now depend on Optum’s data services and doctors, and UHC covers services offered by providers who are Optum Care’s competitors. “Like a lot of situations in the health care market, United was more forward-thinking,” says George Hill, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “They were the first guys to plant the flag in the ground, realizing that care delivery could be the next large business in the space.”Optum’s strategy broke from the industry convention of expanding “horizontally”—with hospitals acquiring hospitals and insurers acquiring insurers. UHG expanded “vertically” to seek more growth in part because years of horizontal acquisitions meant it had expanded into every insurance market it wanted to be in.Another key driver for UHG’s strategy came in the Affordable Care Act. Embedded in that landmark legislation were measures designed to wring better value from the health system by rewarding quality of care. Insurers were also subject to a new regulation—the Medical Loss Ratio floor—that required they spend 80% to 85% of their premium income on medical care, effectively capping their profitability. For fatter margins, insurers would have to look for revenue elsewhere in the health care system. View this interactive chart on Fortune.comThat supercharged UHG’s foray into health services, and it has built that business with an eye toward efficiency—buying up surgical centers and urgent care clinics that can provide services more cheaply than hospitals, and bulking up on data-crunching tools to inform care-related decisions. Wilson, the chief medical officer, describes those pieces as the infrastructure for delivering and incentivizing value-based care.Such care is rooted in the idea that much of what ails America’s miserably fragmented and expensive health system are the flawed incentives at its heart, the “fee-for-service” payment model that rewards providers for volume of care rather than good outcomes. The fix requires flipping those incentives on their head, encouraging the use of less-expensive services like primary care and preventative medicine, along with coordination tools that help keep people healthy.The idea has wide support, but the concept has become muddled in practice. The term is now used loosely to describe an array of payment models where providers assume a degree of risk in providing care. These include the “capitated” (lump sum) payments in Medicare Advantage, a fast-growing business that in recent years has become the industry’s most profitable and highly prized. Of the 60 million people currently enrolled in Medicare, roughly half have signed up for Medicare Advantage programs—which are run by private insurers.With an aging population and an attendant pot of revenue as an incentive, there’s suddenly a lot more energy behind the shift to value-based care. UHG has a larger, clearer vision, and Wilson acknowledges its heft helps in getting there: “One does need a critical mass of patients to execute on this [and] physicians collectively, to be open and willing to innovate with us.”Dr. Tony Lin has spent his entire career at Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, a multispecialty practice in Houston. Since he joined in 1993, Kelsey has grown to include hundreds of doctors at 36 branches across the city. Kelsey earned a reputation for providing high-value care on a capitated model, receiving a lump sum to manage a patient’s health. The practice achieved good results by taking a team-based approach to care and by providing services like joint replacements and chemo infusions—often performed in hospitals at great expense—at a much lower cost in its clinics.Dr. Tony Lin, Chair of the Kelsey-Seybold Clinic poses for a portrait Thursday May 11, 2023 in Richmond, Texas.Lin, now Kelsey’s CEO, could promise employers on average 15% to 30% savings on health care spending. But when it came to bigger companies in the Houston market, that didn’t matter. They’d ask, “Who is Kelsey? What do you do? You only have 300 doctors?” and instead choose a national plan. To Lin, it was clear what he needed: “partners to get bigger.”In April 2022 Lin hitched Kelsey to the Optum train. When Fortune visited Kelsey in mid-May, Lin said the relationship was still in the early stages—not much has changed for doctors on the front lines—but he felt fortified by the relationship: “We’re bigger, we’re more accessible. There’s more technology.”Those tech resources include machines that can quickly screen for peripheral artery disease, allowing nurses to do in under five minutes a test that previously took 15 and was thus often skipped. Lin says Kelsey has tested 70% of its Medicare Advantage patients, a third of whom they discovered to be at risk. Those patients now receive a range of treatments, from care plans focused on diabetes and blood pressure control to discussions about lifestyle changes—interventions that Lin says can prevent more serious issues like claudication (muscle pain) or ulcers.Leveling up also means providers have access to data analytics that can help stratify and target patients according to their risk of health setbacks, and to sort primary care physicians and specialists according to how closely they adhere to evidence-based medicine—all designed to steer patients to the most effective care.Value-based care isn’t yet the norm at UHG. Of its insurance company’s roughly 50 million members, 15 million are under value-based arrangements; and of Optum’s more than 103 million patients, just 4 million get capitated care. But Lin says he values UHG’s commitment to the philosophy. Despite the enormous scale of Kelsey’s new owner, Lin still feels, in America’s fee-for-service-dominated health system, that he and his colleagues are the little guys. Joining forces with Optum, he says, “gives us a little more juice.”Traditionally, doctors and insurers are at odds in a zero-sum standoff: The more you provide, payers say, the less I make. But in the move to value-based care, UHG saw an opportunity in putting providers and payers on the same team—an opportunity CVS and others are now also seizing.The evolution of CVS beyond toothpaste and toilet paper began long before Karen Lynch arrived. In 2006, the pharmacy chain bought MinuteClinic, its first foray into storefront clinics; a year later, it paid $26.5 billion for Caremark, the country’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, which effectively sets drug prices for 110 million Americans.More deals followed over the next decade, some more successful than others, but the M&amp;A that brought Lynch in-house was the most consequential. In 2015, Lynch was named president of Aetna, after running the integration of its $7.3 billion purchase of Coventry, a Medicaid and Medicare insurer. Then, in 2018, CVS bought Aetna—and tasked her with merging its enormous operations into the pharmacy chain.Overseeing that high-stakes corporate marriage put Lynch in line for the top role at CVS, and once she took the reins, she continued that company’s transformation. CVS supersized many of the in-store clinics it already operated in some of its 9,000 locations, as Lynch moved to expand more aggressively into primary care—the vital, if underfunded and short-staffed, front door for health care. “Consumers are seeking this type of relationship,” she told investors in late 2021. “We can be at the center of their care.”That proposition is even more appealing when consumers come with government-guaranteed insurance. Lynch’s M&amp;A strategy has zeroed in on providers whose patients are or soon will be eligible for Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Last year, Lynch got into a bidding war with UHG and Amazon for Signify Health, a Dallas-based company that sends doctors and other providers to the homes of elderly patients. In September, CVS agreed to pay $8 billion for Signify’s 10,000 providers and 2.5 million patients. “It’s kind of a throwback to the ’50s, where the doctor used to come to the home,” says Signify Health CEO Kyle Armbrester. “We can bring [care] in a convenient, accessible, preventative way.”Lynch wasn’t done. Oak Street has a different model than Signify, but a similar patient base. It operates storefront clinics in lower-income urban neighborhoods and strip malls in 21 states, providing care to more than 225,000 seniors—more than half of whom are Black, Latinx, or Indigenous. In February, while waiting for the Signify deal to close, CVS agreed to pay $10.6 billion for Oak Street. Less than three months later, it was the proud owner of two big, Medicare Advantage–focused businesses.Lynch still wants to buy digital health tools, to better connect CVS’s health care operations with consumers. But as she told investors and Fortune in early May, first she wants to focus on bringing Signify and Oak Street in-house, and cross-selling their services to more current or potential patients. “It’s like the renaissance of health care right now, where you see everyone moving to this value-based care using technology-enabled platforms,” Lynch says. “Now we’re all connected together.”Lynch, Armbrester, and Oak Street’s Pykosz spoke with Fortune during a joint interview near West Palm Beach. It was the first time all three CEOs sat down with a reporter, a week after the Oak Street deal closed. During an hour-long conversation, Lynch was rarely the first to respond to questions, allowing the two younger men who had just become her newest direct reports to take first crack at promoting and defending their work. But all three stuck to the same message: Combining their separate businesses, to give CVS a larger piece of Americans’ health care spending, will give the nation what it needs. “I’m really proud of what we built—but that’s not moving the needle for the country,” Pykosz said. “CVS will allow us to grow, to reach more older adults—and to allow us to say we’re actually helping to solve societal problems.”Over multiple interviews, Lynch consistently argues that chasing profits will also benefit patient welfare—even as she acknowledges that, as head of a huge public company, her first responsibility is to the bottom line. “While recognizing that we have shareholders, and a lot of different stakeholders, my personal passion is, ‘How do we improve the health care system?’ ” she says. “We have the opportunity to really drive engagement, simplicity, effectiveness—and to drive patients to the right care at the right time, in the right places.”“While recognizing that we have shareholders, and a lot of different stakeholders, my personal passion is, ‘How do we improve the health care system?’“Karen Lynch, CEO, CVS HealthSome argue that the biggest health care companies are too effective in the wrong ways. Federal and state lawmakers are concerned about the tremendous pricing control exerted by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which they wield to keep their costs down and profits up. The three largest PBMs—CVS’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth’s OptumRx— control about 80% of the market. In May, a U.S. Senate committee advanced a bill that would ban certain PBM pricing practices, while Florida Governor (and presumed 2024 Republican presidential candidate) Ron DeSantis signed a PBM reform bill into state law.Lynch attributes this fervent regulatory wave to “a lack of understanding” about how PBMs “reduce pharmacy costs.” But doctors, patients, nonprofit experts, and pharma companies also criticize PBMs and their insurer owners for routinely refusing to fully cover drugs and devices that doctors consider medically necessary, including women’s contraception, when cheaper potential alternatives exist. The effect is to stifle innovation—and to limit the medical treatments available to all Americans, in the interests of restraining costs.Many also see the nation’s devastating opioid crisis as a symptom of the industry’s elevation of financial efficiency over well-being. In November, CVS and Walgreens each agreed to pay about $5 billion, without admitting wrongdoing, to settle lawsuits over their pharmacists’ roles in filling opioid prescriptions. (Like the crisis itself, the related litigation has been ongoing since well before Lynch joined CVS.) Other health care giants—including drug distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health—have reached similar settlements.Charts show the national health expenditures since 1990All these critiques come in the context of broader frustration, particularly among progressives, with decades of M&amp;A. “The furious pace of consolidation in health care is resulting in higher prices and lower-quality care for patients,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told Fortune in an email. FTC Chair Lina Khan has called health care “an area where we’ve seen so much consolidation across the entire supply chain, and what seems to be serious harm stemming from potential abuses of market power.”Given that skepticism, CVS, which spent about six months jumping through regulatory hoops before it could finish buying Signify, expected similar scrutiny over the Oak Street merger. Instead, the FTC let the deal slide through in three months. Antitrust lawyers and Wall Street analysts were shocked. Even CVS itself, which was initially expecting the merger to take most of 2023 to finalize, was caught a little by surprise; it has announced that it will make less money this year than predicted, since it had suddenly moved the unprofitable Oak Street onto its books. (In May, CVS also took out a $5 billion loan, so it could pay Oak Street shareholders months earlier than expected.)Not that Lynch is complaining in public. Now that she’s assembled the core pieces of CVS’s primary care pivot, she has the chance, and the challenge, to prove that her company can meaningfully improve the nation’s health care.One of Oak Street’s newer clinics sits on a wide corner in Bushwick, the rapidly gentrifying hipster enclave in Brooklyn. On a recent sunny afternoon, the facility’s stately green-and-white signage—complete with an AARP endorsement—competed for attention with a teal-and-white urgent-care storefront across the street. Inside, past the receptionists, a large and airy (if empty) community room awaited seniors who, executives say, are welcome to come in to check email, meet for coffee, or enjoy the air conditioning—regardless of whether they need medical care.The Bushwick location, one of 16 that Oak Street has opened in New York City in three years, is well-stocked and seemingly well-staffed. There are three on-site clinical providers, including two doctors who speak fluent Spanish—important in a neighborhood where more than half the population is Hispanic. “We find that many people who get care at Oak Street have sometimes not felt welcomed by the health care system—and we pride ourselves on really nice places where people can feel welcomed and supported,” says Dr. Marisa Rogers, an Oak Street executive medical director.That’s if they can be enticed to walk in the door in the first place. During an hour-long midday visit, a Fortune reporter saw about 10 staff members—but crossed paths with no patients entering or leaving. (A spokesperson later confirmed that three patients had appointments during that time.) Pykosz says that emptiness is a feature, not a bug: “We actually really love when there’s no one in the waiting room, because that means everyone’s in their exam rooms,” he says.Still, it’s safe to assume CVS didn’t buy Oak Street without wanting to fill its storefronts with more patients. Lynch, Armbrester, and Pykosz sketch out a future in which many of the 1,100 seniors who walk into each CVS pharmacy every week—some 8 million potential customers overall—are referred to Oak Street clinics for a wellness visit, or offered a home visit from a Signify doctor who can help them stay on track with medications.Signify Health CEO Kyle Armbrester and Oak St. Health CEO Mike Pyosz photographed together in Boynton Beach, Florida on Wednesday, May 10, 2023.Those pharmacy relationships could become invaluable pipelines for Signify and Oak Street. They could also help them overcome some of the scrutiny they’ve faced over their existing customer acquisition tactics. Patients have complained in online reviews to the Better Business Bureau about “relentless” telemarketing calls from Signify; meanwhile, Oak Street in 2021 disclosed that it was the target of a Department of Justice investigation around its marketing. (A spokesperson says Oak Street is complying with the inquiry.) “It is hard to reach seniors,” Armbrester says, “but we do that in a way that’s highly compliant .”Most notably from a strategic standpoint, Oak Street and Signify focus on Medicare Advantage populations. That positions them, along with CVS, right at the center of some of the fiercest battles over integration and value-based care.At the core of the conflict is the fact that capitation in Medicare Advantage is risk-based: That is, providers get larger sums to care for patients with more complex conditions. Makes sense, but the government alleges that many of the market’s largest players exploit that formula for profit by “overcoding” how sick their patients really are, defeating the purpose of value-based care. (“We disagree with any characterization of upcoding in our business,” an Oak Street spokesperson says by email.)“We’ve got some important imperfections in those risk-adjustment systems,” says Dr. Mark McClellan, a former administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who leads the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy. “You have an incentive to identify more diagnoses and get paid more that way.” A recent CMS rule, to be phased in over three years, aims to prevent the abuse with changes to the model. In the meantime, the debate continues, and some of the industry’s early proof points—data suggesting that the integrated model is working—receive piercing scrutiny. At UHG, Wilson, the chief medical officer, celebrates Optum’s House Calls program, a service geared for its Medicare Advantage population, as a triumph of patient-centered, equity-enhancing medicine. In 2022, advanced practice nurses visited 1 million patients at home, at no charge, to conduct an evaluation and “environmental scan” in which their health and social needs were inventoried. UHG identified undiagnosed conditions in a quarter of the population, putting patients who had fallen through the cracks on track to receive care.Dr. Margaret-Mary WIlson, Chief Medical Officer UHG, poses for a portrait Thursday May 11, 2023 in Richmond, Texas.It’s an encouraging story. But it rests uneasily next to a 2021 report from the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general’s office that flagged home-based risk assessments as a way Medicare Advantage sponsors—UHC chief among them—maximized their payments. A UHC statement says the report “ignores the significant health benefits delivered by in-home clinical care.”Observers are also split over how to interpret a peer-reviewed study that Optum researchers published on JAMA’s Open Network last December. The paper looked at the outcomes of more than 300,000 Medicare beneficiaries, half of whom were in two-sided risk Medicare Advantage plans (in which physicians gain financially if outcomes are good and lose if they’re bad), versus half in traditional fee-for-service plans. The Optum team found those in the MA plans were at significantly lower risk for hospital admission (–18%) and emergency room visits (–11%), among six other improved quality metrics. The MA patients were also found, however, to have much higher rates of comorbiditi—33% had been diagnosed with diabetes, compared with 23% in the fee-for-service population, and they were more than twice as likely to be coded as having kidney or lung conditions. UHG argues that these patients’ conditions were legitimately diagnosed thanks to Medicare Advantage’s model, avoiding complications and expense down the road. It also notes that CDC figures estimate 29% of adults have diabetes. But critics see the disparities as proof of upcoding, emerging yet again.The promise of value-based care has been a pot of gold at the end of the health care rainbow that policymakers, innovators, and business leaders have chased for years. But now, with the largest, most profitable health care companies more boldly jostling for opportunity and touting early success, there’s some awkward ambivalence among value-based care’s early champions. In conversations with a couple dozen stakeholders, including three former CMS administrators, about Big Health Care’s fitness for the value-based care role, most opinions landed between skeptical and wait-and-see. Will care improve? Maybe, through better coordination. Will it lower costs? Unlikely. Is investment in primary care, whatever the source, a good thing? You bet.“Insurers are arguing it gives doctors a chance to become part of integrated care, and build more supportive systems,” says Donald Berwick, another former CMS administrator. “I think the evidence is not there right now.” Doctors, he says, are demoralized: “They want to work for patients, and now they find that working for financial interests … it’s a toxic trend that we’re going to pay dearly for.” Indeed, to the extent that consolidation squeezes doctor compensation, it may be self-defeating—since that will mean fewer medical practitioners, at a time when an aging population arguably needs more.Elizabeth Mitchell, CEO of the Purchaser Business Group on Health, a coalition of the nation’s largest employers, argues that consolidation—horizontal or vertical—has been working to the detriment of her member organizations for years: “All of the evidence shows that it does not improve quality or patient experience, but it absolutely drives up prices.”“The incentives are not super strong for these companies to actually do a great job of lowering costs,” says Dave Windley, a Jefferies analyst, who notes that from an investor’s perspective, shrinking insurance-side revenue is “like stunting one’s own growth.” But experts also concede that the impacts of vertical consolidation, of the sort CVS and UHG are pursuing, are less well understood, in part because it’s newer, and the companies haven’t been very transparent.The common takeaway is that Big Health Care has much work to do in gaining trust—among health care practitioners and patients alike—and in proving that its business models are as healthy for society as they are for their bottom lines.To which the response of the giants seems to be: Give us a little more time. Looking ahead after CVS’s buying spree, Lynch sounds as if she knows the burden of proof is on her industry. “We’re making progress, we did what we said we would,” she says. “And we now have to make all those connections.”A version of this article appears in the June/July 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""Big health care's big test.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Changes Course in 2023Several economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms.Consequently, the Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike in 2023. In his post-FOMC statement in May, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank may keep interest rate unchanged at the current 5-5.25% range.A lower rate hike has enabled growth sector like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive this year. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 20% year to date. The broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index has also seen a decent rally of 8%. However, the Dow is down 0.3% so far this year.Our Top PicksDefying a struggling Dow, we have narrowed our search to four blue-Chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023.

317,a1bf7cd1-10a9-3388-83ad-7860c50af133,SLG,2023-05-25,4 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes as Market Volatility Continues,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-dividend-hikes-122600000.html,1684931160.0,STORY,"['LYB', 'WMS', 'SLG']","[Markets have been volatile over the past month, with stocks struggling for direction as investors are unable to gauge the Fed’s plans with its interest rate hike policy. Fears of a recession at the end of this year have been looming large, further making market participants jittery.The Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points in its May meeting to a range of 5-5.25%. Inflation, on the other hand, has started signs of easing lately, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 4.9% year over year in April compared with a 5% rise in March. This is the lowest annual rate since April 2021.Impressive inflation data has raised hopes that the Fed might finally halt its interest rate hikes, which could begin as early as in June when the central bank officials meet for its two-day policy meeting.However, investors are yet to get a clear picture of the Fed’s future course of action as officials in its May meeting said that it would make a decision based on the data that comes in. Although inflation has started showing signs of easing, it’s still a lot higher than the Fed’s target level of 2%.The U.S. economy has been slowing as multi-year-high interest rates continue to cripple industries. U.S. GDP grew a moderate 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the consensus estimate of 2% growth.The manufacturing sector has largely been impacted by rising rates, which is taking its toll on the economy. Although the ISM manufacturing PMI improved to 47.1 in April, the sector has been contracting for several months. In fact, the manufacturing sector declined to a three-year low in April, which speaks a lot about the economy’s health.Stocks in FocusGiven this situation, betting on dividend-paying stocks would be a wise decision. Dividend stocks with a solid business plan and a proven track record are known for handling market volatility. An astute investor should thus consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are LyondellBasell Industries N.V. LYB, AAON, Inc. AAON, SL Green Realty Corp.

319,17b59151-aed5-3b3f-9bc7-720945a3790a,AFL,2023-05-25,Here's Why You Should Hold Aflac (AFL) in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-aflac-afl-194100898.html,1684957260,STORY,"['AFL', 'BRO']","[Aflac Incorporated AFL is well-poised to grow on the back of its cost-curbing measures, global investments, growing network in the domestic market and expanding product suite.Aflac operates as a supplemental health and life insurance products provider. It has strong footprints in the United States and Japan. Based in Columbus, GA, AFL is likely to benefit from the high interest rate environment.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceAFL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 14.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 12.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Trend in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFL’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $5.79 per share, indicating an 8.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $5.33. The estimate rose 3.6% in the past 30 days. The consensus mark for current-year revenues is $18.2 billion.Business TailwindsAFL’s U.S. segment witnessed a 5.3% increase in sales in the first quarter of 2023, courtesy of growth investments and productivity gains, marking an impressive trend. The U.S. business is expected to build on that momentum with the help of its acquired platforms like dental network and vision, as well as group life and disability.Aflac’s strategic moves to expand its product suite in the U.S. segment are praiseworthy. The company’s U.S. business is set to benefit from refreshing cancer protection assurance policy. Going forward, product innovations and the development of virtual sales channels, increased face-to-face interactions and the recruitment of productive agents are likely to drive U.S. business sales.The company’s Japan business gained from higher total new annualized premium sales in the first quarter. A cancer product launch is helping the unit in this regard. Products like WAYS and Child Endowment should help boost the top line as the company is focused on improving opportunities to sell its third-sector products.Story continuesThe company’s benefit ratio, which measures the amount paid in claims as a percentage of premium, is expected to improve in 2023. Total net benefits and claims of $2,150 million declined 13.4% year over year in the first quarter. Its cost-saving initiatives will drive the bottom line.The benefit ratio for Aflac U.S. segment is expected to decline as the company realizes rewards from scaling acquisitions, focusing on premium growth and investments in U.S. platforms. The same for the Japan segment is expected to decline as a shift of premiums from first-sector to third-sector products will result in more savings after paying claims.The company also earns through net investment income. The metric increased 4.4% in the first quarter. A high-interest rate environment should boost this metric in the future.Aflac’s balance sheet strength enables the company to take shareholder value-boosting measures. In the first quarter, the company bought back shares worth $700 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had 106.3 million shares authorized for buybacks left. Management paid out dividends worth $257 million in the first quarter.Key ConcernsThere is a factor that investors should keep a careful eye on.Aflac’s net cash from operations declined 23.2% in 2022 and 43.8% in the first quarter of 2023. In the last five years, the company witnessed declines in net cash from operations four times. The continuation of this trend can impact future operations. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the broader finance space are Erie Indemnity Company ERIE, Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.

320,8815ad3a-7e80-3679-b4b1-51e4bc9d0954,AFL,2023-05-25,Why Aflac (AFL) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-aflac-afl-top-dividend-154506833.html,1684943106,STORY,['AFL'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusBased in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -8.2%. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.42 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.54% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.51% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11.72%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%. This means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.79 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8.63% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

She is a pit mix, which tends to carry a certain stigma, but if they only knew what a pushover she is! I'm amazed every day at just how much she loves people and other dogs. - Jason Pearce and dog, PhoebeOriginally published on Aflac NewsroomThe tail that wags when you walk in the door. The purrs that provide comfort and love. The neighs, bleats, barks and meows that make you laugh. There is no denying that pets bring so much joy to life's everyday moments. In fact, multiple studies indicate that there are correlations between pet ownership and benefits for mental wellness1 and cardiac health.2At Aflac, we love our four-legged family members, so much so that there is an entire page on our intranet dedicated to the Pets of Aflac. In honor of National Pet Month, the pet owners of Aflac share their stories and tips for celebrating and caring for their pets during this special month and all year long.Show them lots of love, and give them your time and attention - every day.Pets need regular exercise and engagement. Go for plenty of walks and let your pets explore new environments occasionally. You can also play games - indoor and/or outdoor - that offer both mental and physical engagement, like fetch, treat or treasure hunts, toy chases and obstacle courses. There are also pet day care facilities and professionals that specialize in giving your pets plenty of engagement outside of the home. And of course, lots of playtime, snuggles and special treats for pets are all great ways to spoil them.Pet ownership is a big commitment - something to always consider is your schedule and ability to stick to a routine - but what it requires in responsibilities, it more that pays off with unconditional love and comfort.Invest in training.When you bring a pet into your life, you are building a relationship with a creature that does not speak the same language as you, which is why a quality and regular training regimen is critical.Story continuesIn the training process, not only will you be able to teach your pet how he or she can communicate with you, but you'll also learn how to understand what your pet is trying to tell you. By paying attention to their body language and how they act around other people, you'll pick up on important cues that your pet is trying to signal to you.Put in the time to train when they are young, and it will pay off in the long run. And remember to be patient, as they are always learning.Protect them.Our pets rely on us to take care of them and to protect them. Start with the basics: quality food, access to fresh water, grooming, dental care, routine veterinary visits - including exams, vaccinations, etc. - and pay attention to any behavioral changes that could indicate health issues. It's also important to establish a relationship with and stay close to your veterinarian, as they can help you find the best ways to care for your pet and ensure his or her wellness.Expect the unexpected from your pet.With video calls still a part of daily life, many pet owners know the cute chaos that ensues when their pets sneak up on the screen.

It is also implementing pricing actions to offset cost inflation, especially in raw materials.The company is focusing on cost reductions through restructuring, which is expected to provide benefits in 2023. It expects to realize approximately $50-$70 million in estimated annual savings, 75% of which are expected to be realized by the end of 2023.Moreover, the company remains committed toward expanding its retail operations. It is focused on capturing a larger share of its end-markets, as is evident from increasing number of retail stores.Sherwin-Williams is benefiting from favorable demand in domestic markets. The company is seeing strength in North American professional architectural end markets. It is witnessing higher architectural sales volumes in the Paint Stores Group segment. Net sales from this segment climbed nearly 15% year over year in the first quarter of 2023 driven by a rise in sales volume in all end markets and higher selling prices. The momentum in this segment is likely to continue in the second quarter on higher architectural demand.SHW also has a strong liquidity position and is using its cash strategically. Significant efforts to cut operating costs helped the company to generate strong net cash flows from operations of around $1.9 billion in 2022. The company returned around $1.5 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2022. It also repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock during the most recent quarter.However, demand has softened in Europe due to the sluggish macroeconomic environment. Moreover, the lack of meaningful recovery in China following the lifting of pandemic-led restrictions is also affecting demand. The company sees a challenging demand environment in the second half of 2023. It is witnessing weak demand in new residential and the Consumer Brands Group DIY.Story continuesOn the industrial side of the business, it is seeing more pressure in North America while Europe and China are yet to fully recover. This is likely to exert pressure on its sales volumes.Sherwin-Williams’ industrial wood business is also being hurt by the slowdown of the U.S. housing market. Sales in this business fell by mid-single digits in first-quarter 2023, hurt by a slowdown in furniture, cabinetry and flooring related to the weakness in new residential.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Biotechnology is one of the hottest sectors these days. A handful of industries, such as space exploration, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, are making rapid leaps forward. For biotechnology, the greatest stimulus has been the coronavirus pandemic as the industry was solely responsible for bailing humanity out of the devastating crisis.Simply put, biotechnology is the use of biological raw materials to make vaccines and other products with them. This is in sharp contrast to traditional pharmaceutical applications that use plants and other raw materials to make medicines. Through biotechnology, firms such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) were able to develop the revolutionary messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines that were able to effectively reduce the severity of the disease. mRNA is simply a storage vehicle for instructions that program cells to produce certain kinds of proteins. For the coronavirus vaccine, these proteins fight the virus molecules and protect the recipient against the disease.Apart from mRNA, there are dozen of other applications for biotechnology as well which are not limited to human health either. The sector is responsible for having saved countless lives over the past few decades simply by enabling the production of insulin. While insulin was initially produced by pigs, naturally there aren't enough pigs in the world to meet the needs of all diabetics. To solve this problem, biotechnology enabled insulin makers to clone the human gene responsible for making insulin in bacteria and produce as much of the life saving substance as needed. Apart from insulin, other sectors such as gene therapy, vaccine vegetables, and diagnosis are other areas that are a crucial part of the biotechnology industry.Story continuesMoving forward from human health, other areas benefiting from biotechnology are chemicals production and agriculture as organic compounds enable significant streamlining of these industries. These use cases naturally end up leading to stunning valuations of the industry. For instance, a research report from Grand View Research outlines that the biotechnology industry was worth a whopping $1.37 trillion last year. From 2023 until 2030, the industry is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.96% - a rather high rate when we consider the large size of the sector. This growth rate can ensure that the biotechnology industry is worth $3.88 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Grand View Research adds that one of the biggest sectors in the market was DNA sequencing, as it accounted for 16.5% of the market and grew due to the dropping costs of this technology. In terms of growth, the research firm believes that one of the fastest growing segments will be nanobiotechnology, which is expected to outpace the broader market in growth by increasing by 14.87%. Application wise, healthcare was unsurprisingly the largest sector as it represented more than half of the total market.One major drug in the biotechnology industry that is making waves these days is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s DUPIXENT. This is a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COP) - a devastating disease stemming from lung damage mostly in former smokers. At the firm's latest earnings call, management shared the remarkable impact that this drug is making, as they outlined:The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease.We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD.With these impressive details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top biotechnology stocks that hedge funds are piling into, out of which the top picks are Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Union Pacific investors that purchase the stock on or after the 30th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.20 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Union Pacific has a trailing yield of approximately 2.7% on its current stock price of $191.91. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Union Pacific has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Union Pacific paid out a comfortable 46% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 59% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's not ideal to see Union Pacific's earnings per share have been shrinking at 3.1% a year over the previous five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Union Pacific has lifted its dividend by approximately 16% a year on average.To Sum It UpIs Union Pacific an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have fallen significantly, although at least Union Pacific paid out less than half of its profits and free cash flow over the last year, leaving some margin of safety. To summarise, Union Pacific looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.So if you want to do more digging on Union Pacific, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Union Pacific and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) have reached a “historic” tentative agreement that seeks to give engineers a more predictable work schedule, the two groups said Wednesday.The agreement, which still needs to be ratified by union membership, calls for a schedule that would consist of 11 days on call and four days off. Implementation could take place within a year of ratification.The arrangement will better manage staffing levels, which could also help support more consistent and reliable service, according to UP (NYSE: UNP). About 5,600 locomotive engineers represented by BLET work for the railroad.“The 11-4 work/rest schedule will be life altering for employees who are used to working on-call 24/7, 365 days a year,” said BLET National President Eddie Hall. “We applaud our BLET General Chairmen and Union Pacific’s management for this important step that we believe will improve our members’ quality of life. This significant change in scheduling not only will make life better for locomotive engineers and their families, it also should help Union Pacific retain and recruit employees.”Said UP President and CEO Lance Fritz: “Union Pacific values its craft professionals and their candid feedback, which have led to these historic changes, improving the quality of life for the locomotive engineers who move the goods Americans rely on every day. Last fall, we promised to address their concerns and find solutions, and we want to thank union leadership for their collaboration on this industry-leading agreement.”The agreement between UP and BLET comes as fellow Class I railroad Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) recently reached an agreement with train conductors represented by the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division that addresses both scheduling and sick leave.Indeed, predictable schedules and sick leave have been key issues for both train conductors and locomotive engineers during the most recent round of collective bargaining between the unions and the Class I railroads.

(AP) — Engineers who operate trains for Union Pacific will soon have much more predictable schedules that will allow them to plan when they are going to be off, a change addressing one of the key quality-of-life concerns that pushed the rail industry to the brink of a strike last fall.The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad announced a deal with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union Wednesday that will let UP's roughly 5,600 engineers plan on having four days off in a row after spending 11 days straight on call. Within those 11 days, there will likely be some breaks between shifts because federal rules require 24 hours off after engineers work four straight days, but it's hard to predict where that time off will fall.“The 11-4 work/rest schedule will be life-altering for employees who are used to working on-call 24/7, 365 days a year,” said BLET National President Eddie Hall. “This significant change in scheduling not only will make life better for locomotive engineers and their families, it also should help Union Pacific retain and recruit employees.”Workers said during the contract talks that demanding schedules, combined with the railroads' strict attendance policies, were making it difficult, if not impossible, to take any time off, with train crews having the most unpredictable schedules. The engineers and conductors that operate the trains routinely get the worst of it because railroads cannot predict exactly when trains, which run around the clock, will be ready to leave.But since Congress intervened and blocked rail workers from going on strike because they worried about the potential economic consequences, Union Pacific and the other major freight railroads have made strides by reaching a number of agreements to start providing paid sick time to workers. The union that represents conductors announced a deal with Norfolk Southern that's similar to the new BLET deal with UP to make their schedules more predictable. That pact will put conductors on a schedule of working six days in a row followed by two days off.Story continuesIn another sign of progress, the conductors’ union — the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers — just announced another agreement Wednesday with CSX that will provide sick time for about 3,000 more conductors. A previous deal with CSX provided sick time to about 2,400 other conductors.Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz said this agreement with the BLET will improve “the quality of life for the locomotive engineers who move the goods Americans rely on every day.” But the engineers union still lacks a sick time agreement with Union Pacific. So far, the only railroad the engineers union has secured sick time from is Norfolk Southern.A pilot project earlier this year in the Kansas City area showed that the schedule changes helped reduce the number of days engineers took off at the last minute and kept some engineers from walking away from the railroad. If that continues once these new schedules are put in place across the railroad over the next year, that will help it count on having more of the workers it needs to drive its trains show up when they are scheduled to work. The railroad said the result should be fewer delays and better morale.Union Pacific, one of the nation's largest railroads, hauls all kinds of goods across 23 western states.]"

Shares have added about 3.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ameriprise due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Ameriprise's Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, AUM Balance DipsAmeriprise’s first-quarter 2023 adjusted operating earnings of $7.25 per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.13. The bottom line reflects a rise of 25% from the year-ago quarter. We had projected the same to be $6.60.Results were aided by growth in revenues. However, the tough operating backdrop hurt the assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) balances.After considering significant items, net income (GAAP basis) was $417 million or $3.79 per share, down substantially from $825 million or $7.10 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses DeclineOn an operating basis, adjusted total net revenues were $3.7 billion, up 3% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.72 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $3.52 billion.On a GAAP basis, net revenues were $3.74 billion, growing 3%.Adjusted operating expenses totaled $2.72 billion, which declined 2%. We had projected the same to be $2.60 billion.Total AUM and AUA decreased 8% year over year to $1.24 trillion. The fall reflected strong client net inflows that were more than offset by market depreciation and unfavorable foreign exchange translation.Share RepurchasesIn the reported quarter, Ameriprise repurchased 1.6 million shares for $503 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.Story continuesVGM ScoresAt this time, Ameriprise has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Ameriprise has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerAmeriprise is part of the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry. Over the past month, BlackRock (BLK), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.BlackRock reported revenues of $4.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.7%.

(NASDAQ:CSCO)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-110028216.html,1685012428,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$52.31 and falling to the lows of US$45.70. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cisco Systems' current trading price of US$48.41 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Cisco Systems is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $73.39, but it is currently trading at US$48.41 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Cisco Systems’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Cisco Systems?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 23% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Cisco Systems. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Cisco Systems from their most recent forecasts.

(CSCO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-trending-130013699.html,1684933213,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +3.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share, indicating a change of +25.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.76 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.03 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.79 billion and $58.3 billion estimates indicate +10.1% and +2.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $14.57 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.5%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.39 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.27%. The EPS surprise was +3.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now it is time to buzz across the Atlantic Ocean and learn more about the sweet things we are doing with technology and bees at Cisco Amsterdam.Many Cisco employees feel a responsibility to protect the natural world and its species. That's why employees at the Amsterdam campus have established a rooftop beehive and are even integrating technology into the hive.Bees in the NetherlandsMore than 360 different species of bees are known to exist in the Netherlands. Only one of these is the well-known honeybee. This is a bit of a special case, because they hardly occur in the wild in the Netherlands. People benefit daily from the work of insects like bees, also called pollinators. About 4 out of 5 food crops in Europe are dependent on pollination by these insects. Despite the important role that honeybees play in our lives and food systems, half of the bee species in the Netherlands are on the red list of endangered species.Globally, close to 35 percent of invertebrate pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, face extinction, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.Amsterdam beehiveThe beehive at Cisco's Amsterdam office has been there since 2012. The beehive is located on the roof and is maintained and monitored by Cisco employees who volunteer to take care of it. The presence of the beehive provides an opportunity for employees to learn more about the fascinating world of bees and get hands-on experience with beekeeping. Some examples of the activities that the bee team does: maintaining the beehive, bulb planting, and raising awareness about the bees.Being the innovators that we are at Cisco, there has also been a focus on how the beehive can benefit from technology. Throughout the years the beehive has become more and more connected, using Cisco's own technology and sensors.Story continues""Being with our honeybees is a fantastic sensory experience; the smell of honey and wax, the buzz of a beehive at the height of summer is unbelievable. It has taught us to observe and appreciate the intricate relationships between the bees and their surroundings, and the importance of protecting biodiversity. It is wonderful to share the experience and awareness with colleagues, customers and their family members that have visited the Connected Bees on the roof of the Amsterdam office."" - Arjan Zoodsma, Success Program Manager for EMEA NorthConnected beehive - Smart ""buildings"" for beesHumans have the technology to make our buildings smart and connected, but could bees benefit from a connected space, too? It turns out the answer is ""Yes!""A connected beehive that can measure temperature and keep track of bees with cameras shares similarities with a smart building in terms of its use of technology for optimization and efficiency. Just as a smart building uses sensors to monitor and regulate temperature, lighting, and other environmental factors, a connected beehive uses sensors to measure the temperature and humidity inside the hive. Both smart buildings and a connected beehive demonstrate how technology can be used to improve the functionality and sustainability of living systems.The technology that keeps our beehive connectedIn the Cisco beehive, every time the door to the roof opens, an alert is sent to a Webex room to notify that someone is near the beehive. The alert is sent thanks to a Meraki MT20 sensor on the door, which was placed there during the pandemic when it was difficult to get multiple people to the office for a beehive check. To make sure it was still possible to continue the beehive checks during the pandemic, the sensor was installed. Now that we're returning to our office, the technology is still being used and has been beneficial for a team where work is hybrid and employees are not always in the office physically to check on the bees.Next to the door sensor, there are four Meraki cameras on the roof. Two of them provide a view of the beehive from a bit further away, so we can see what is happening around the beehive. The third and fourth camera, Meraki MV5's, are placed in front of the beehive opening and provide a zoomed-in view. This angle allows us to see exactly what's going on at the entrance of the hive in real-time.We achieve the real-time sharing of sensor data with a backbone of Meraki networking gear. The MR76 access point, MX67 router, and MS 120 switch are also installed on the roof next to the beehive. The AP's enable wireless connectivity for the sensors, the MS120 switch provides Power over Ethernet for the sensors, as well as wired connectivity, and the router makes it possible to access the ‘beehive network' from across the world through the internet.Inside the beehive is a BEEP base automatic measurement system, which can monitor the weight, temperature, sound frequency, and humidity in the hive. All of this can be monitored through a dashboard, and we can keep a close eye on what the conditions inside the hive are like.Technology like this could be used in other ways to efficiently connect to other things as well. For example, think about the plants in your office. By placing a sensor in the pots, you can easily keep track of how your plants are doing and whether they need water.Interested in Starting your own hive?Here's 5 steps you can take to get started on your own connected beehive:Find a location. The hive should be placed in a location that is safe, easily accessible, and receives plenty of sunlight. It should also be away from foot traffic and any potential sources of disturbance. Good options include a rooftop or (private) garden.Obtain necessary permits. Depending on your location, you may need to obtain a permit to keep bees close to neighbors or near a public road. Inform yourself of local regulations to see what permits are required. Additionally, reach out to other local beekeepers to gain locally relevant information.Create a safety plan. Create a list of gear needed for your volunteers. Set up a list of emergency procedures and purchase necessary safety items. Inform nearby institutions and neighbors about your plans for the hive.Prepare and educate. To prepare and educate volunteers to work with a beehive, provide training, familiarize them with a hive and its bees, demonstrate proper techniques, and review safety procedures.Obtain bees and a hive. There are many different types of bees and hives to choose from. It's a good idea to do some research. Reach out to local beekeepers or beekeeping organizations to best obtain bees. This will help you obtain the best bees for the local circumstances, the best hive to work with, or potentially obtain a swarm from another beekeeper.Monitor the hive. Regularly check on the hive to ensure the bees are healthy and the hive is functioning properly. Tasks include making sure they have enough space and food, harvesting honey, and adding hive boxes. Additionally, you can create a connected beehive with sensors and cameras to monitor the hive remotely and get real-time data and images.View original content here.Cisco Systems Inc., Wednesday, May 24, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/756969/World-Bee-Day-Meet-Ciscos-Connected-Bees-in-Amsterdam]"
